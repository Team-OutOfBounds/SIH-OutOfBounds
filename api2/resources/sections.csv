Dinesh Gupta
v.
The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
(Criminal Appeal No(s). 214 of 2024)
11 January 2024
[Vikram Nath* and Rajesh Bindal,* JJ.]","Despite the commercial nature of the dispute involved, criminal
complaint was filed and an FIR was registered against the
appellants. Whether, the High Court was justified in refusing to
quash the FIR and the summoning order.
","Administration of Justice – Abuse of process of law – Forum
shopping – Financial transactions between parties based in
New Delhi – On the basis of complaint filed by respondent-
complainant, FIR was registered in Gautam Budh Nagar against
three companies, appellants-promoters of the companies and
other accused persons – Summons issued by Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar – Appellants sought quashing
of the FIR and the summoning order, petitions dismissed by
High Court – Correctness:
Held: The registration of FIR at Noida despite companies in question
having registered offices at Delhi shows a wishful forum shopping
by the Complainant – Though the complainant had invested crores
of rupees in equity of the companies based at Delhi, knowing well
their place of business, yet their incomplete addresses showing
them at Gautam Budh Nagar, was deliberately mentioned to
falsely create jurisdiction in Gautam Budh Nagar which did not
actually lie there – Also, though address of the respondent was
mentioned to be of Noida, his residential address was not given
– Order of CJM shows no application of mind, as no reasons
were assigned – Magistrate did not take into consideration the
address of the complainant and the accused companies as also
the addresses of their Directors – Further, claim of the respondent
that the appellants had induced the complainant to advance loan

and later on converted the loan into equity is false – It was a plain
and simple transaction between the corporates – Even as per the
complainant’s case, the short-term loan was advanced in the year
2010 for a period of one year – However, when the same was not
returned, no steps were taken by the complainant to recover the
same until the FIR in question was registered on 29.07.2018 i.e.
8 years & 7 months later – Furthermore, on facts, the complainant
concealed material facts which were within his knowledge at the
time of filing of complaint as regards the merger of the companies
– Entire factual matrix and the time lines clearly reflects that the
complainant deliberately and unnecessarily caused substantial
delay and was waiting for opportune moment for initiating false
and frivolous litigation – Impugned order set aside – FIR and all
subsequent proceedings qua the appellants, quashed – Costs of
₹25 lakhs imposed on the respondent. [Paras 38, 23, 25-28, 32,

","Judgment
Vikram Nath, J. & Rajesh Bindal, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Unscrupulous litigants should not be allowed to go scot-free. They
should be put to strict terms and conditions including costs. It is
time to check with firmness such litigation initiated and laced with
concealment, falsehood, and forum hunting. Even State actions
or conduct of government servants being party to such malicious
litigation should be seriously reprimanded. In the instant case, we
find initiation of criminal proceedings before a forum which had
no territorial jurisdiction by submitting incorrect facts and giving
frivolous reasons to entertain such complaints. A closer look at the
respondent’s actions reveals more than just an inappropriate use of
jurisdiction. The core issue of the dispute, which involves financial
transactions and agreements, clearly places it in the realm of civil
and commercial law. Yet, the respondent chose to pursue criminal
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 393
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
charges in a quest to abuse the criminal justice system with a motive
to seek personal vengeance rather than seeking true justice. This
unnecessary turning of a civil matter into a criminal case not only
overburdens the criminal justice system but also violates the principles
of fairness and right conduct in legal matters. The apparent misuse
of criminal proceedings in this case not only damages trust in our
legal system but also sets a harmful precedent if not addressed.
3. A common order1 passed by the High Court2 dismissing the petitions
filed by the appellants seeking quashing of the summoning order3
has been impugned in the present appeals.
FACTUAL MATRIX –
4. Karan Gambhir, who owns M/s D.D. Global Capital Pvt. Ltd.
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Company’) is the complainant in the
FIR4 which was registered against Sushil Gupta, Rajesh Gupta, Dinesh
Gupta, Baljeet Singh & others. Three private limited companies had
also been arrayed as accused i.e. BDR5, Gulab Buildtech6 and Verma
Buildtech7. The individuals, namely, Sushil Gupta, Rajesh Gupta
and Dinesh Gupta are stated to be the promoters of the aforesaid
three companies.
5. Only two of the accused persons, i.e. Dinesh Gupta and Rajesh Gupta
approached the High Court seeking quashing of the summoning
order and the FIR. Nothing was pointed out at the time of hearing
that any matter filed by any other accused is pending either in this
Court or High Court.
6. It is alleged by the complainant that his company was induced to
extend short-term loans of ₹ 5,16,00,000/- to Gulab Buildtech and
₹ 11,29,50,000/- to Verma Buildtech respectively. Later, the said loan
was converted into debt equity allegedly promising high returns from
real estate business to the complainant. The shares were allotted

3 Dated 15.02.2021 in Case No.2828 of 2021 (re-numbered as 4084 of 2021)

5 M/s BDR Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘BDR’)
6 M/s Gulab Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Gulab Buildtech’)
7 M/s Verma Buildtech and Promoters Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Verma Buildtech’)
394 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
at an exorbitant price. The complainant acquired 21% shareholding
in Verma Buildtech, whereas, in Gulab Buildtech, the shareholding
was to the tune of 4.53%. A share pledge agreement was forged,
allegedly to have been executed in favour of Sushil Gupta, one of the
accused (not before this Court). Some scheme of amalgamation was
made by Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to amalgamate the
aforesaid companies with BDR, as a result of which, the percentage
of shareholding of the company reduced considerably. No notice
was served on the company of the proposed amalgamation. The
amalgamation was got approved from the Delhi High Court. The
share certificates were allegedly never physically handed over to
the complainant.
7. The complainant further alleged that when he asked the accused to
return the loan with interest, initially time was sought stating that there
is slump in the real estate market and thereafter, the accused started
ignoring the complainant. That is when the complainant decided to
take legal recourse against the accused. Prayer was made in the
police complaint for registration of a case of cheating and forgery
against the accused. While filing the complaint, the complainant had
given his address as ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, Sector-2, Noida
Sector-20, Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.’
8. After investigation, the police found that a case was made out against
the accused under Sections 420, 467 and 120-B of the IPC. A
charge-sheet was filed on 29.12.2020. Accordingly, the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, vide order dated 15.02.2021 took
cognizance and issued summons to the accused.
9. The appellants filed petitions under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before
the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR and the summoning
order dated 15.02.2021. The petitions having been dismissed by
the composite order passed by the High Court, the same are under
challenge in the present appeals.
ARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANTS –
10. Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. Nakul Dewan and Ms. Anjana Prakash, learned
senior counsels for the appellants submitted that the complainant
who owns the company invested a sum of ₹5,16,00,000/- in Gulab
Buildtech and ₹11,29,50,000/- in Verma Buildtech by acquiring equity
shares thereof. Prior to the investment, a resolution was passed
by the company in the meeting of the Board of Directors held on
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 395
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
25.03.2011, approving investment of ₹11,29,50,000/- in the equity
shares of Verma Buildtech. Similarly, by a resolution dated 26.08.2011,
investment in the equity shares of ₹5,16,00,000/- was approved in
Gulab Buildtech. Hence, the complainant’s case that it was a short-
term loan given by the company, was totally contrary to the record
since a conscious decision had been taken by the company to make
investments in the equity shares of Gulab Buildtech and Verma
Buildtech. The above two resolutions are reproduced hereunder:
First Resolution:
“AUTHORIZATION TO INVEST INTO THE EQUITY
SHARES OF M/S VERMA BUILDTECH & PROMOTORS
PRIVATE LTD.
The Chairman apprised the Board of Directors of the
Company about the benefit of investment into the equity
shares of M/s Verma Buildtech & Promoters Private
Ltd offered by way of private placement. The Directors
discussed about the same at length and the following
resolutions were passed.
“RESOLVED THAT the company be and is herewith
authorized to make an investment of Rupees Eleven
Crore Twenty Nine Lacs and Fifty Thousand only
(Rs.11,29,50,000/-) in pursuance of the provision of the
companies Act, 1956.”
“RESOLVED FURTHER THAT Mr. Narender Kumar and Mr.
Tarun Kumar Director of the company be and are hereby
severally authorized to do the necessary act including the
signing of the documents, deed and agreement and other
necessary paper which are incidental and consequential
to give effect to the above said resolution and collect the
Share certificates.”
Second Resolution:
AUTHORIZATION TO INVEST INTO THE EQUITY
SHARES OF M/S GULAB BUILDTECH PRIVATE LIMITED.
The Chairman apprised the Board of Directors of the
Company about the benefit of investment into the equity
shares of M/S GULAB BUILDTECH PRIVATE LIMITED
396 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
offered by way of private placement. The Directors
discussed about the same at length and the following
resolutions were passed.
“RESOLVED THAT the company be and is herewith
authorized to make an investment of Rupees Five Crores
Sixteen Lacs only (Rs.5, 16,00,000/-) in pursuance of the
provision of the companies Act, 1956.”
“RESOLVED FURTHER THAT Mr. Narender Kumar and Mr.
Tarun Kumar Director of the company be and are hereby
severally authorized to do the necessary act including the
signing of the documents, deed and agreement and other
necessary paper which are incidental and consequential
to give effect to the above said resolution and collect the
Share certificates.”
11. In 2012, when the petition8 was filed seeking amalgamation of Gulab
Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR, the Delhi High Court,
as per requirements, had issued notice to all the shareholders of
the two companies on 09.07.2012. No objection was raised by the
complainant or the company at that stage. On 20.02.2013, the scheme
of amalgamation was approved by the Delhi High Court in terms of
which the company became entitled to 3,74,280 shares of BDR.
On 08.03.2013, a letter was written by Gulab Buildtech and Verma
Buildtech to the complainant to surrender original share certificates
of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to facilitate issuance of
new certificates.
12. Nearly one year after the amalgamation, on 31.01.2014, DD
Global Capital Limited, the company of the complainant filed an
application9 before the Delhi High Court seeking recall of the order of
amalgamation passed by the High Court as it was without any notice
to the company. Other grounds were also raised in this application
for recalling the order of amalgamation. The aforesaid application
was dismissed by the High Court on 15.03.2016 by a detailed order
8 Company Petition No.287 of 2012
9 Company Application No.321 of 2014
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 397
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
dealing with all the issues raised. The order attained finality as the
company did not challenge the same any further. In the aforesaid
proceedings, a letter dated 08.10.2014, allegedly written by Sushil
Gupta, one of the accused (not before this Court), claiming that the
shares of the company with Verma Buildtech were pledged to him,
was also placed on record. This issue was also dealt with by the
High Court.
13. More than two years after the application filed by the company was
dismissed by Delhi High Court, the instant complaint was filed with
the police at Gautam Budh Nagar, on the basis of which FIR in
question was registered on 29.07.2018.
14. It is the appellants’ submission that a purely civil dispute with
reference to financial transactions between corporates is sought to
be given colour of a criminal case. Though the company does not
have any connection whatsoever with Gautam Budh Nagar and all
the transactions were held at New Delhi between the parties, which
are based in New Delhi, yet the complaint was filed at Gautam Budh
Nagar. Even the address of the complainant given in the complaint
is ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, Sector-2, Noida Sector-20, Gautam
Budh Nagar, U.P.’ which neither belongs to the complainant nor his
company. The aforesaid facts clearly establish that the idea was
only to harass the appellants.
15. In fact, the dispute amongst the parties has already been referred to
Arbitration by the Delhi High Court vide order dated 15.05.2019 and
the company has already filed its claim before the sole Arbitrator.
16. The aforesaid facts clearly establish that no case was made out
against the appellants. Further, there is no allegation pertaining to
forging of any documents against them. It was a simple business
transaction. Arm-twisting method to recover any dues cannot be
permitted to be used. In support of the appellants’ arguments, reliance
was placed on the judgment of this Court in Randheer Singh v. The
State of U.P. & others10.
10 2021 INSC 440: (2021) 14 SCC 626.
398 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
17. It was submitted that there was total non-application of mind by
the Trial court while passing summoning order, which is entirely
non-speaking in nature. Even the High Court failed to consider the
arguments raised by the appellants.
ARGUMENTS OF THE RESPONDENT – COMPLAINANT
18. On the other hand, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel for
the respondent-complainant, submitted that solely on persuasion
of the accused, huge amount of short-term loan was advanced.
Subsequently, shares were allotted, which were never handed over
to the complainant. The companies whose shares were allotted,
namely, Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech were amalgamated
with BDR. During the process of amalgamation, despite being a
shareholder, the complainant was not issued any notice. As a result
of amalgamation, the percentage of shareholding of the company
was reduced considerably.
19. The letter conveying that the company had pledged its shares to
Sushil Gupta shows that certain documents had been forged. He
further referred to the order dated 20.02.2013 passed by the High
Court in Co. Pet. No. 287 of 2012, showing that the accused persons
are connected with each other. He also referred to the Balance
Sheet of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to show that the
amount advanced by the complainant was shown in the column of
‘current liabilities’. Indian Accounting Standards have been referred
to show the meaning of ‘current liabilities’ which is in the form of
short-term loan.
20. The argument is that the accused persons in connivance with each
other have cheated the complainant for crores of rupees by making
false promise of higher returns. There is no error in the order passed
by the High Court. The appeals deserve to be dismissed.
FINDINGS –
21. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
material on record.
22. On a complaint filed by the respondent no.2, FIR in question was
registered on 29.07.2018. The address of the company D.D. Global
was mentioned as ‘C/o A & A Earth Movers, D-9, Sector-2, Noida
Sector-20, Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.’ to be the present as well as
the permanent address. This is the first misleading statement made
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 399
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
by the complainant. From a copy of the resolution passed by the DD
Global dated 25.03.2011, it is evident that the registered office of the
DD Global is located at F-1/9, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-I, New
Delhi. Even at the time of hearing, it remained undisputed that DD
Global is not carrying on any business at Noida, nor has it rented the
place mentioned above. Further, the firm ‘A & A Earth Movers’ whose
c/o address has been given is not the sister concern of DD Global.
23. Similar was the case with reference to the accused nos. 2 & 3,
namely, Rajesh Gupta and Dinesh Gupta, appellants before this
Court. Their incomplete addresses have been mentioned reflecting
them to be the residents of Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar. The
position is same in the case of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech.
Though the complainant had invested crores of rupees in equity
of the aforesaid two companies based at New Delhi, knowing well
their place of business, yet in those cases, incomplete addresses
showing them at Sector 20, Gautam Budh Nagar, was deliberately
mentioned. It is sufficiently clear that the idea was to falsely create
jurisdiction in Gautam Budh Nagar which did not actually lie there.
24. The falsehood in the complaint, filed with reference to the addresses
of the accused, was established at the time of filing of charge-sheet.
Whereas in the FIR, the addresses of all the accused given were
incomplete merely mentioning the address as ‘Sector 20, Gautam
Budh Nagar’, in the charge-sheet addresses of not only the appellants,
namely, Rajesh Gupta and Dinesh Gupta, were found to be ‘D-393,
New Friends Colony, New Delhi, even Sushil Gupta and Baljeet
Singh were also found to be residents of New Delhi. The following
are the addresses of the parties involved in the matter:

25. Though address of Karan Gambhir who was signatory of the complaint
on the basis of FIR in question registered, was mentioned to be of
Noida, same as was given in the complaint. However, his residential
address was not given. His parentage was also not mentioned. The
second person shown in the chargesheet is a supporting witness,
Sanjay Gambhir, who has shown his present and permanent address
of ‘P.S. Hauz Khas, N-58, Panchsheel Marg, New Delhi’. The same
is the position with reference to Tarun Gambhir, who also is claimed
to be a supporting witness. All other witnesses were officials who
were involved in the investigation of the case.
26. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, vide order dated
15.02.2021 took cognizance thereof and issued summons to the
accused. The order shows no application of mind, as no reasons have
been assigned. The Magistrate also did not take into consideration
the address of the complainant and the accused companies as
also the addresses of their Directors. There was complete lack of
application of mind while taking cognizance and issuing summons.
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 401
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
27. Coming to the allegation of the complainant being misled for advancing
loan, which was later on converted into equity, the appellants placed
on record two resolutions dated 25.03.2011 and 26.08.2011 passed
by the company vide which decision was taken by the complainant
to invest in the equity of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech to
the tune of ₹5,16,00,000/- and ₹ 11,29,50,000/- respectively. The
said resolutions passed by the complainant have not been denied.
Hence, the claim that the appellants had induced the complainant to
advance loan and later on converted the loan into equity, is totally
false. It was rather a deliberate decision taken by the Board founded
on above-mentioned company resolutions.
28. Further, it is apparent that the complainant had concealed material
facts which were within his knowledge at the time of filing of complaint.
These facts pertained to the complainant’s knowledge of the merger
of Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR, details whereof
are noted hereinafter.
29. A Company Petition No.287 of 2012 was filed in the High Court for
merger of the Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR. As
required, due notice was issued to all the concerned stake holders
including all the shareholders and creditors. The same was published
in the newspapers also. The complainant neither raised any objection
nor appeared before the High Court. After considering the material
placed on record, the High Court allowed the merger application on
20.02.2013, as a result of which Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech
were merged into BDR. Nearly, one year thereafter on 31.01.2014,
the complainant company filed a Company Application No. 321 of
2014 for recall of the order dated 20.02.2013. The grievance raised
was that the order of merger was passed without notice to the
company, which held substantial percentage of shares in both the
companies. The aforesaid application was dismissed by the High
Court vide order dated 15.03.2016. The same was not challenged
by the company any further and, hence, attained finality.
30. It would be relevant to note that in the application filed for recall of
the merger order by the complainant, it was nowhere mentioned
that initially the complainant had advanced loan, which was later on
converted into debt equity. It only mentioned that the complainant was
a shareholder of the transferor company and as a result of merger
402 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
their percentage of shareholding and value of shares decreased. It
was also nowhere pleaded in the application that the shares held
by the company were mortgaged to Sushil Gupta by forging the
documents. The new story of forging documents was built up in the
complaint filed with the police only to give a criminal colour which
actually was commercial in nature.
31. Not only this, despite dismissal of the application filed by the
complainant for recall of the merger order by the High Court vide
order dated 15.03.2016, in the complaint made to the police on
29.07.2018 i.e. more than two years and four months later, still the
complainant did not furnish complete details thereof, especially the
filing and dismissal of the application for recall of the merger order.
Rather, it merely stated that he got the documents from the High
Court which were filed along with the amalgamation application and
came to know about certain facts therefrom but did not mention
about the application filed for recall of the order of amalgamation
and the result thereof. Non-disclosure of such relevant facts was a
deliberate and mischievous attempt on the part of the complainant
to maliciously initiate criminal proceedings for ulterior motives.
32. Most importantly, it needs to be noticed that it was a plain and simple
transaction between the corporates. Even as per the complainant’s
case, the short-term loan was advanced in the year 2010 for a period
of one year. However, when the same was not returned, no steps
were taken by the complainant to recover the same until the FIR in
question was registered on 29.07.2018 i.e. 8 years & 7 months later.
33. Further, the complainant came to know about the merger of the
Gulab Buildtech and Verma Buildtech with BDR in the year 2013
itself. However, even after dismissal of the application filed for recall
of the merger order passed by the High Court on 15.03.2016, no
steps were taken to recover the amount, except getting the FIR
registered more than two years later. All these facts clearly reflect
upon the ill designs of the complainant.
34. The entire factual matrix and the time lines clearly reflects that the
complainant deliberately and unnecessarily has caused substantial
delay and had been waiting for opportune moment for initiating false
and frivolous litigation.
[2024] 1 S.C.R. 403
Dinesh Gupta v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
35. Further, it has been noticed by the High Court in the impugned
order that on an application filed by the appellants, an Arbitrator
was appointed by the Delhi High Court vide order dated 15.05.2019
to settle the dispute amongst the parties and the said matter was
still pending.
36. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we find that the FIR in question,
if proceeded further, will result in absolute abuse of process of
court. It is a clear case of malicious prosecution. Hence, the same
is required to be quashed.
37. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The impugned order passed by
the High Court is set aside. FIR No.1271 of 2018 dated 29.07.2018
registered with Gautam Budh Nagar Police Station, Noida, and all
subsequent proceedings thereof qua the appellants are quashed.
38. Before parting with the judgement, we are reminded of the opening
remarks. The respondent Karan Gambhir having misused the legal
system by lodging false and frivolous complaint with non-disclosure
of necessary facts must bear its costs. The registration of FIR at
Noida despite having registered offices of companies in question at
Delhi shows a wishful forum shopping by the Complainant, casting
serious doubts on their bona fides. The Complainant had already
sought remedy against amalgamation order before the High Court
and the High Court had dismissed the same. However, Complainant
chose to again use judicial mechanisms to raise his grievances. A
criminal complaint was filed and FIR was registered against appellants
despite the commercial nature of dispute. Such ill intended acts of
abuse of power and of legal machinery seriously affect the public
trust in judicial functioning. Thus, we find ourselves constrained to
impose cost on Complainant with a view to curb others from such
acts leading to abuse of judicial remedies.
39. Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case, we
impose costs of ₹25 lakhs on the respondent Karan Gambhir to be
deposited within four weeks from today with the Registry of this Court.
Upon receipt of the said amount, the same will be transmitted in equal
amount to the SCBA & SCAORA to be utilised for the development
and benefit of their members.

","Judgment
C.T. Ravikumar, J.
1. The appellants herein were the respondents before the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short ‘the
NCDRC’). As per the impugned order, the NCDRC allowed revision
petition No. 3384 of 2006 filed by the Life Insurance Corporation
of India, the respondent herein and reversed the concurrent orders
of the forums below passed in favour of the appellants herein and
dismissed their complaint that culminated in a direction in their favour
for grant of compensation.
2. Succinctly stated, the facts that led to the captioned appeal, are as
follows: -
The appellants are the widow and the children of one Shri Narender
Kumar Kantilal Modi (hereafter referred to as ‘the deceased’) who
met with an accidental death due to electric shock on 14.07.1996.
Prior to his death, the deceased submitted a proposal form for Life
Insurance Policy on 06.07.1996 and issued cheque of Rs. 3388/-
towards premium on 09.07.1996 through cheque No. 187009
dated 08.07.1996 of Dhokla Branch of State Bank of Saurastra.
456 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
At this juncture, it is to be noted that there is no dispute regarding
the permissibility of effecting premium in the said mode. After the
death of the deceased the appellants herein claimed benefits based
on Insurance Policy Diary No. 832471906. Even after 14 months
since the death of the policy holder, the respondent did not give
any benefit and as such the appellants were constrained to cause
legal notice. The stand of the respondent for repudiating the claim
was that the proposal submitted by the deceased was not accepted
and therefore there is no concluded contract between the deceased
and the respondent. In fact, the respondent had blocked policy
No.832471906 and issued Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt
showing the policy No. 832471906.
3. In the aforementioned circumstances, aggrieved by the repudiation,
the appellants herein approached the District Forum by filing complaint
No. 1044 of 1997 in terms of Section 11 of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”). As per order dated 19.07.2001, the
District Forum allowed the complaint and directed the respondent to
pay total outstanding amount payable to the appellants as per terms
and conditions of Insurance Policy No. 832471906 along with interest
at the rate of 12% per annum till realization within 30 days from the
date of receipt of the copy of the order. Further, it was directed to
pay Rs. 5000/- to the appellants towards compensation for mental
agony and harassment as also Rs. 2000/- towards costs. Aggrieved
by the order of the District Forum, the respondent herein/the opponent
therein filed an appeal viz. appeal No. 464 of 2002 before the State
Commission. The State Commission dismissed the appeal as per
order dated 25.07.2006 against which the respondent herein filed
a revision petition before the National Commission in terms of the
provisions of the Section 21 (b) of the Act. The impugned order was
passed thereon and it resulted in reversal of the concurrent orders
of the forums below and dismissal of the complaint.
4. Heard, learned counsel for the appellant and also the learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the respondent. The factum of submission of
proposal for Life Insurance Policy on 06.07.1996 by the deceased and
also issuance of cheque bearing No. 1870092 therewithal towards
premium are not in dispute. The allotment of policy No. 832471906,
rather its blocking in the name of the deceased is also not in dispute.
The contention of the appellants before the District Forum was that
the respondent had accepted the first premium amount and issued
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 457
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt on 09.07.1996 and in view
of the nature of the receipt issued the respondent could not have
repudiated the claim and wriggled out of the liability to assume the risk.
5. Per contra, the respondent took the stand that the policy prepared
was not actually communicated to the deceased and it was blocked
on 15.07.1996 owing to the demise of the proposer Shri Narender
Kumar Kantilal Modi. Further, it was contended that in the aforesaid
circumstances there was no concluded contract between the
deceased and the respondent. It is to be noted that even after
taking such a stand the respondent offered Rs. 1 Lakh on ex gratia
basis to the appellants. However, the appellants refused to accept
the same and claimed the amount payable in terms of the terms
and conditions in Policy No. 832471906. Obviously, the District
Forum took note of the rival factual contentions and also the further
fact of payment of commission in respect of the policy to the agent
and consequently, the defence raised on behalf of the respondent
herein to justify that the repudiation of the claim was rejected and
the complaint was allowed.
6. In the appeal before the State Commission, the respondent reiterated
the contentions unsuccessfully taken before the District Forum. As
noticed before, the core contention was that on the date of death of
“the deceased” there was no concluded contract between the insurer
and the deceased. The contentions raised did not find favour with
the State Commission and the State Commission found that the
acceptance of the proposal was unconditional and in favour of the
deceased and therefore the contract should relate back to the date
from which the insurance coverage was granted i.e., w.e.f. 28.06.1996.
Assigning such a reason, the State Commission dismissed the appeal.
It is the order of the appeal confirming the order of the District Forum
that was taken up in revision before the NCDRC by the respondent
herein, which culminated in the impugned order.
7. A perusal of the impugned order would reveal that for reversing the
concurrent orders and dismissing the complaint, the NCDRC assigned
the reason that mere receipt and retention of the premium until after
the death of the deceased-applicant or even the mere preparation
of the policy and its blocking would not amount to acceptance of
the proposal for insurance policy. To arrive at such conclusions, it
relied on the decision of this Court in Life Insurance Corporation
458 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of India v. Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba and Ors.1. It was
held that the fora below had erred in directing for payment of benefits
in terms of the subject policy.
8. Various contentions were raised on behalf of the parties before us
to support their rival contentions. We have already taken note of the
factual contentions raised on behalf of the parties. In the light of the
contentions the question to be considered is whether the NCDRC
was justified in reversing the concurrent orders of the forums below
and in dismissing the complaint. It is to be noted that even after
dismissing the complaint NCDRC took note of the offer made by the
respondent to the appellant for payment of an amount of Rs. 1 Lakh
ex-gratia vide paragraph 4 (d) of the memo of the revision petition,
and issued a specific direction to the respondent to pay a sum of
Rs. 1 Lakh to the appellant by way of ex-gratia. Before adverting to
the rival contentions and looking into the correctness or otherwise of
the reversal of the concurrent orders we find it appropriate to dilate
this aspect of the impugned order.
9. As noted hereinbefore, as per the impugned order the NCDRC
dismissed the complaint. Therefore, the question is how can an
order carrying a specific direction for payment, even by way of ex-
gratia, be issued in a complaint after dismissing the same. It is to
be noted that such an order was passed in a revision petition filed
by the respondent herein. Jurisdiction of the NCDRC under the Act
is provided under Section 21 thereof. Section 21 (a) has two Sub-
clauses and Sub-clause (i) thereof deals with the original jurisdiction
of NCDRC to entertain complaints and Sub-clause (ii) thereof deals
with appeals against orders of the State Commission. Section 21 (b)
deals with its revisional power. Section 21 of the Act reads thus: -
“21. Jurisdiction of the National Commission.—
Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the National
Commission shall have jurisdiction—
(a) to entertain—
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or
services and compensation, if any, claimed
exceeds [rupees one crore]; and
1 [1984] 3 SCR 350 : (1984) 2 SCC 719
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 459
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
(ii) appeals against the orders of any State
Commission; and
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders
in any consumer dispute which is pending before or
has been decided by any State Commission where it
appears to the National Commission that such State
Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested
in it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so
vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction
illegally or with material irregularity.”
10. A bare perusal of Sections 21 (a) and 21 (b) would reveal that the
powers thereunder are different and distinct and the powers under
Section 21 (b) is very limited. The NCDRC itself, in the decision in
Kongaraananthram v. Telecom Distt. Engineer, Ma- Habubnagar2,
held that its revisional powers under the said Section are very limited.
The said Section provides power to call for the records from the State
Commission and to set aside its order issued sans jurisdiction vested
in it by law or if the State Commission failed to exercise a jurisdiction
so vested or if the State Commission has acted in exercise of its
jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
11. As noticed hereinbefore, a specific direction was issued under the
impugned order by NCDRC after dismissing the complaint which
was allowed by the District Forum and got confirmance from the
State Commission. It is true that what was ordered by NCDRC is not
for payment of benefits based on the policy bearing No.832471906
but only payment of Rs.1 lakh by way of ex gratia, as offered in the
memorandum of the revision petition. Ex gratia is an act of gratis and
has no connection with the liability, payable as a legal duty. Going
by the Oxford Dictionary of Law, 5th Edition, the term “ex gratia” is
payment not required to be made by a legal duty.
12. In the contextual situation, it is relevant to refer to the decision of this
Court in Sudesh Dogra v. Union of India & Ors.3. This Court held
therein that ex gratia is an act of gratis and it got no connection with
the liability of the State under law and the very nature of the relief
2 1990 SCC OnLine NCDRC 24
3 (2014) 6 SCC 486
460 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and its dispensation by the State could not be governed by directions
in the nature of mandamus unless, of course, there is an apparent
discrimination in the manner of grant of such relief.
13. In the context of the directions, it is also to be noted that such an
offer was made by the Respondent much earlier even before the
matter reached the District Forum, but the appellant had denied to
accept such an offer. The specific direction, in such circumstances
issued in exercise of the revisional power dissuade us to accept
the impugned order as one dismissing the complaint in toto and in
the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned order virtually partakes
the character of an order modifying the order of the District Forum
which was confirmed by the State Commission. Be that as it may, we
will further consider the question whether the NCDRC is justified in
reversing the concurrent order in the complaint filed by the appellants
in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
14. A perusal of the impugned order would reveal, as noted earlier, that
the reversal of the concurrent order(s) of the forums below and the
consequential rejection of the complaint made by the NCDRC after
coming to a conclusion of non-existence of a concluded contract was
by relying on a decision of this Court in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli
Kamba’s case (supra). It is true that in the said decision this Court
held thus:-
“15. Though in certain human relationships silence to
a proposal might convey acceptance but in the case of
insurance proposal, silence does not denote consent
and no binding contract arises until the person to whom
an offer is made says or does something to signify his
acceptance. Mere delay in giving an answer cannot be
construed as an acceptance, as, prima facie, acceptance
must be communicated to the offerer. The general rule
is that the contract of insurance will be concluded only
when the party to whom an offer has been made accepts
it unconditionally and communicates his acceptance to the
person making the offer. Whether the final acceptance is
that of the assured or insurers, however, depends simply
on the way in which negotiations for an insurance have
progressed. See in this connection statement of law in
MacGillivray & Parkington on Insurance Law, Seventh
Edn., p. 94, para 215.”
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 461
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
15. The factual position obtained in the case on hand tend us to hold
that the NCDRC had failed to bestow proper consideration of the
factual position which consequently led to the mis-application of the
decision in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba’s case (supra). In
view of the decision in D. Srinivas v. SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. &
Ors.4, wherein this Court distinguished the decision in Raja Vasireddy
Komalavalli Kamba’s case (supra), we are of the view that NCDRC
had misdirected itself in considering the relevant question involved,
which was rightly considered by the District Forum. In the decision
in D. Srinivas case, this Court held thus:-
“12. Although we do not have any quarrel with the
proposition laid therein, it should be noted that aforesaid
judgments only laid down a flexible formula for the
Court to see as to whether there was clear indication
of acceptance of the insurance. It is to be noted that
the impugned majority order merely cites the aforesaid
judgment, without appreciating the circumstances which
give rise to a very clear presumption of acceptance of the
policy by the insurer in this case at hand. The insurance
contract being a contract of utmost good faith, is a two-
way door. The standards of conduct as expected under
the utmost good faith obligation should be met by either
party to such contract.”
16. Paragraph 11 of the decision in D. Srinivas case (supra) would
reveal that the afore-quoted recital was made thereunder after
considering the decision in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba
case (supra). In short, the decision in D. Srinivas case (supra)
would obligate us to consider whether the circumstances obtained
in this case give rise to a very clear presumption of acceptance of
the policy by the insurer instead of merely giving imprimatur to the
impugned order of NCDRC on the ground that it was rendered relying
on the decision in Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba’s case. In
this context, it is only apposite to note that though the orders were
passed by the District Forum which was confirmed by the State
Commission would reveal that the analysis and the consequential
conclusion arrived at thereunder lie in conformity with the exercise
4 (2018) 3 SCC 653
462 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
expected to be undertaken based on the aforementioned exposition
of law in D. Srinivas’s case (supra). We are not oblivious of the
fact that the decision in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) was rendered
much later to the order impugned in this appeal. But then, in view
of the exposition of law in Murthy v. State of Karnataka & Others5
as also in view of D. Srinivas’s case (supra), if the analysis and
the ultimate conclusions of the District Forum is in tune with the
decision in D. Srinivas’s case, we are bound to restore the same.
In Murthy’s case (supra), this Court held that normally the decision
of the Supreme Court enunciating a principle of law is applicable
to all cases irrespective of the stage of pendency thereof because
it is assumed that what is enunciated by the Supreme Court is, in
fact, the law from inception.
17. The decision in D. Srinivas’s case was followed by this Court again
in the decision in Gokal Chand (D) Thr. LRs v. Axis Bank Ltd.
and Anr.6, after rejecting a defence relying on the decision in Raja
Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba’s case.
18. Now, we will proceed to consider the question whether circumstances
obtained in this case carry clear presumption of the acceptance of
the policy by the insurer, as has been obligated under the decision
in D. Srinivas’s case (supra).
19. Evidently, it is the case of the appellants that the first premium
was accepted and a duly signed receipt therefor, noting policy
No.832471906 was issued by the respondent on 09.07.1996. The
contents of the same has been reproduced in the synopsis of this
case at page ‘E’ as hereunder.
“Annexure B

the schedule has been accepted by the corporation as
proposed at ordinary rates with E.D.B .................................

[2024] 6 S.C.R. 463
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
We have also received amount noted in the schedule
being the First Premium on the policy of assurance for the
plan and amount indicated therein. The acceptance of this
payment places the corporation on risk with effect from
the date of this Acceptance cum First Premium Receipt or
if the proposal is under the Children/Deferred or Children
Anticipated Assurance Plan from the deferred date on
terms & conditions of the policy of assurance which will
be sent shortly.
The issue of this receipt is also subject to this realisation
of the amount in cash and the terms and conditions of
acceptance printed over leaf.
Policy will be despatched shortly, if you do not receive the
same within next 90 days please write to us.”
20. The photocopy of the Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt is
produced by the respondent along with its written submission as
Annexure B. In fact, Annexure B would reveal the accuracy and
correctness of what is stated at page ‘E’ of the synopsis of the
captioned appeal. A perusal of the same would make it clear that the
acceptance of the payment would place the Corporation to assume
the risk with effect from the date of the Acceptance-cum-First Premium
Receipt. True that in Annexure B, it is stated that it would be subject
to the realization of the amount in cash and the terms and conditions
of acceptance printed overleaf. Though this Court called upon the
respondent to produce the original, the same was not produced
and what was produced was only a photo copy as Annexure B. In
this context, as also in view of the decision in D. Srinivas’s case,
it is only appropriate to refer to certain recitals from the order of the
District Forum. They, in so far as relevant, read thus:-
“1…………………………………..…………………………

opponents have also produce copy of the insurance policy

The State Bank of Saurashtra, Dholka Branch has issued
certificate that the . cheque no. 187009 dated 8.07.1996
favoring LIC of India Rs. 3388/- drawn by Narendra Kumar
Modi paid by them as on 12.07.1996. The opponent also
issued first premium commission bill in the favour of Shri.
P.B. Shah, the agent of the policy issued in the favour of
complaint and in the said bill policy no. -· 832471906, sum
insured Rs. 1.00 lakh, mode of payment, table and term, all
details are stated. The said first premium commission bill

…………... We have to note that when policy number itself
is stated in the said letter dated 29.08.1996 of disputed

policy, means all procedure prior to issuance of policy were
completed and then only the policy number can be allotted
to the proposer and in this case when policy number was
already given to the proposer, means the contract was
started or concluded so the opponent cannot go back with
the terms and conditions of the said contract i.e. policy
no.832471906…………………………………………
…………. The opponent wrote letter dated 17.06.1997 in
connection of complaint’s notice given through advocate
dated 25.03.1997 and 21.04.1997. We have noted that the
title of the letter is stated by the opponent that the title of
the letter is stated by the opponent that “Re: Policy No.
832471906 addressed to Shri T.S. Nanavati, who gave two
legal notices on behalf of the complainants, the opponent
have shown their failings to pay exgratia payment sum
insured only in full and final settlement of the dues under
the aforesaid policy. At this juncture, we have to interpret
the said all words used by the LIC i.e. Ex- gratia or basic
sum insured only in full and final settlement of the dues
under the · above policy all the said words are proving
that the opponent have issued the policy and accepted
the risk ……………............................................................
…………………………….….. We have also noted that the
opponent has deliberately not examined any witness to
prove that the decision to accept the proposal was taken
by the opponent on 15.07.1996 and the death of the
proposer has taken place on 14.07.1996, the contract could
not be said to have been concluded and the contract was
never in existence. We have noted that the contract was
already concluded prior to the death of the policy holder
Shri Narendra Kumar Modi, if the opponent were and
are in possession of the documentary evidence to prove
that the decision to accept the proposal was taken by the
opponent on 15.07.1996, then definitely, the opponent
would have produced oral or documentary evidence to
prove the said facts as this is a crucial point, but the
opponent has not taken . any action to produce oral or
documentary evidence oat this point i.e. only defense of
the opponent in the written statement which amounts to
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 467
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
crush the object of LIC act and other prevailing act to give
protection and risk coverage ………………………....……
...........................................The opponent have not
produced their own record to prove that after the receipt
of the proposal and cheque of premium of Rs3388/- dated
09.07.1996, the decision to accept the proposal was not
taken on 09.07.1996 or immediately within reasonable
period 213 days and took only on 15.07.1996………….”
21. Obviously, the said First Premium Receipt contains the number of the
policy as 832471906 and the next premium date was shown therein
as 28.12.1996. In addition to the aforesaid recitals from the order of
the District Forum, we are of the view that certain other emerging
aspects also assume relevance.
22. Though it is stated, as can be seen from the extracted portion, that
the issue of the receipt is subject to the realization of the amount in
cash and the terms and condition of acceptance printed overleaf,
the printing on overleaf is conspicuously absent in Annexure B. So
also, there is no case for the respondent that the cheque issued
was dishonored.
23. The factum of receipt of cheque amount cannot be disputed by
the respondent. In fact, the statement in the counter affidavit of
the respondent in this appeal that the appellant’s entitlement is
only to get refund of the amount tendered as initial deposit at the
time of submitting proposal would reveal the said position. Another
circumstance is also relevant in the context of consideration based
on the decision in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) viz., the stand of the
respondent that mere preparation of the policy document is not
acceptance so as to create a concluded contract. The cheque amount
was received prior to the death of ‘the deceased’ is not in dispute.
Paragraph 5 of the order of the District Forum would reveal that the
Dhokla Branch of the State Bank of Saurashtra issued certificate that
Cheque No.187009 favouring the respondent herein for Rs.3388/-
drawn by ‘the deceased’ was paid by him on 12.07.1996. The order
of the State Commission in paragraph 3 would reveal the consistent
stand of the respondent that the proposal form was accepted only on
15.07.1996 whereas the death of ‘the deceased’ was on the previous
day viz., on 14.07.1996 and therefore, there was no concluded
contract. The documents pertaining to the proposal were perused by
468 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
both the District Forum and the State Commission and the said fact
is discernible from their respective orders. The various documents
were referred to in the orders with reference to the page numbers,
in which they are available. In the said context, paragraph 6 of the
orders of the State Commission assumes relevance and the same
to the extent it is relevant, read thus:-
“6. Page 125 is the proposal form. Perusal of the same
suggests that the amount of Rs. 3,388/- is shown as deposit
amount and the risk date is shown to be 28.06.1996. Thus,
it will be seen that the policy was desired to be effective
and risk commenced retrospectively with effect from
28.06.1996. It is also suggested that the said proposal form
was filled in on 09.07.1996. Page 126 reads the same to
be suspense memorandum with BOC No. 600392 dated
09 .07 .1996 and the policy of proposal number is shown
as F.P. Page 130 reads that next premium would become
due on 28.12.1996…….”
24. In the circumstances, referred to in the orders of the District Forum
and the State Commission as also noted hereinbefore, the question
is whether a clear presumption as to the acceptance of the policy by
the insurer is available in the case on hand. In Annexure B receipt
of the first premium, it is specifically stated that the acceptance of
payment would place the Corporation on risk with effect from the
date of the said Acceptance-cum-First Premium Receipt, subject to
the realization of the amount in cash and the terms and conditions
of acceptance printed overleaf. What is printed overleaf is not on
record as the same was not produced, though it should be a part
of Annexure B. Thus, the entire circumstances discussed based
on the documents in the orders of the District Forum and the State
Commission hereinbefore in this judgment, in the light of the decision
in D. Srinivas’s case (supra) constrain us to hold that the proposal
was accepted.
25. When the aforesaid being the circumstances revealed from the
conclusions and concurrent findings by the District Forum and the
State Commission entered with reference to the documents perused
by them, in exercise of revisional power the NCDRC could not have
arrived at a finding that the forums below acted in the exercise of
jurisdiction illegally or that there occurred a material irregularity. In
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 469
Mrs. Bhumikaben N. Modi & Ors. v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India
fact, all the circumstances discussed above justify the conclusion
of acceptance of the proposal prior to the death of ‘the deceased’.
26. There is no case for the respondent that Annexure B viz., the First
Premium Receipt carrying the assurance, as mentioned earlier, was
not issued. Annexure B would justify drawing of presumption of
acceptance of the policy and not otherwise. We have also found that
no material irregularity or illegality could be found in the conclusions
drawn with regard to the acceptance of proposal by the District Forum
which was confirmed by the State Commission with reasons. We are
fortified in our view by the following further reasons/ circumstances.
The entry 15.07.1996 in Annexure B and the contentions that the
factum of death was made known on 15.07.1996 and the acceptance
of policy also on 15.07.1996 cannot co-exist. If the amount received
on account of encashment of cheque is kept as deposit/suspense
and was not accepted by way of premium, as has been contended
before the State Commission and duly recorded in paragraph 3
of its order what was the necessity to prepare the First Premium
Receipt on 15.07.1996. There is incongruity in the contentions and
the documents. Along with the written submission on behalf of the
respondent herein, true copy of the suspense memorandum/First
Premium Receipt is produced in this proceeding as Annexure B.
A perusal of the same with reference to what is extracted from
paragraph 6 of the order of the State Commission, would reveal
certain disturbing aspects. As stated in paragraph 6 thereunder
Annexure B would reveal that the date for next premium would
become due on 28.12.1996. At the same time a dubious entry ‘NIL’
is also appearing thereon. Another dubious entry is the writing on
the right top corner of Annexure B i.e., 15.07.1996. The dubiousness
on account of that entry is because of the specific stand taken by
the respondent. As noted earlier, the stand of the respondent is that
the policy was prepared on 15.07.1996 and that the First Premium
Receipt was issued earlier. If it be so why an entry of 15.07.1996
should be made in Annexure B. As stated in paragraph 6 of the order
of the State Commission, the next premium date is shown as due
as 28.12.1996. The name and address of Narendra Kumar Kantilal
Modi and the policy number are also specifically entered therein.
27. In the aforesaid circumstances, there was absolutely no reason or
justification for NCDRC to upturn the concurrent orders and to order
470 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
for the dismissal of the complaint and at the same time issuing a
direction only to grant Rs.1 lakh as ex gratia merely because such
an offer was made by the respondent-insurer in the memorandum of
the revision petition. There cannot be any doubt with respect to the
position that in the absence of anything suggesting that the State
Commission had acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or
with materially irregularity, interference with an order of the State
Commission confirming the order of the District Forum, in exercise
of the limited revisional power under Section 21 (b) of the Act, by
NCDRC, is without rhyme or reason and cannot be sustained.
28. Before the year 1956, life insurance business was in the hands of
private companies which were operating mostly in urban areas. The
avowed objects and reasons of the Life Insurance Corporation Act,
1956 would reveal that the main object and reason is to ensure
absolute security to the policy-holder in the matter of his life insurance
protection.
29. In the circumstances, the impugned order is set aside and the order
of the District Forum in complaint No.1044 of 1997 dated 19.07.2001
which was confirmed by the State Commission as per order dated
25.07.2006 in appeal No.464 of 2002 is restored. The respondent
is granted two months’ time to effect payment in terms of the order
thus restored.
30. The appeal is allowed.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

Held: The issue raised by the State of Madhya Pradesh is with
respect to the identification of the land owned by the applicant
contending that the same forms a part of the Pachmarhi Wildlife
Sanctuary – There have been various rounds of litigation and it is
not in dispute that applicant herein was never impleaded in any of

the applicant and the mutation made in its name had never been
questioned in any Court of law – Neither the Revenue Department
nor the State Government authorities took the trouble of impleading
the applicant as party in any of the litigations – The title acquired
by the applicant over the subject plots not having been challenged,
attainted finality and thus the State cannot claim a right thereupon
simply because at some point of time, the plots came to be recorded
as Nazul lands in the revenue records – The categoric stand in
the compliance affidavit filed by the State fortifies the claim of the
applicant that these plots are falling under the urban area – In this
background, the appellant is justified in claiming that its proprietary
rights guaranteed under Article 300A of the Constitution cannot
be infringed merely on account of the pending writ appeal before
the High Court – Nonetheless, the applicant would satisfy the
authorities that the plots in question are beyond the Eco-Sensitive
Zone – Therefore, it is directed that the application filed by the
applicant for raising construction on plot Nos. 14/3 and 14/4 shall
be decided objectively by the CEC/Competent Authority of the
local body keeping in view the location of the land with reference
to the notified boundaries of the ESZ. [Paras 8, 19, 20, 21, 23]

","Judgment
Mehta, J.
1. These interlocutory applications have been preferred by the applicant
M/s Shewalkar Developers Limited being aggrieved by the inaction
of the respondents in deciding the application filed by the applicant
seeking permission to construct a health/eco-resort on the subject
land being Plot Nos. 14/3 and 14/4, falling in Sheet No. 20, Civil
Station, Pachmarhi, District Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh. The
total area of these two plots is around 59,265 sq. ft. and 49,675 sq.
ft., respectively.
2. The applicant herein approached the Madhya Pradesh High Court
by filing Writ Petition No. 14478 of 2006 seeking a direction to the
728 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
respondents to favourably consider the prayer of the applicant.
Vide order dated 22nd November, 2006, the Division Bench of
Madhya Pradesh High Court permitted the applicant to approach
the Central Empowered Committee(hereinafter being referred to as
‘CEC’) constituted under the directions given by this Court in Writ
Petition(Civil) No. 202 of 1995. Consequently, the applicant preferred
an application to the CEC seeking permission to construct the health/
eco-resort on the land mentioned above asserting that the said
chunk of land was not a forest land and had been acquired under
valid title deeds and thus, the prayer for permission to construct
may be allowed. However, the prayer made by the applicant was
not accepted whereupon, the applications under consideration came
to be filed before this Court.
3. The State Government had previously taken a stand in its counter
that the land in issue falls within the limits of Pachmarhi Wildlife
Sanctuary and therefore, by virtue of the directions issued by the
CEC vide letter dated 2nd July, 2004, no commercial activity was
permissible thereupon, without the permission of this Court.
4. Much water has flown during pendency of the original application(I.A.
No.2930 of 2010) which has remained pending for almost 14 years.
For sake of convenience, a chronological flow chart of dates and
events is narrated hereinbelow in a tabular form: -

revisions against the mutation orders issued in favour of Kripa
Torry and Sanjay Bhandari(purchasers of land from Dennis Torry)
and vide order dated 9th August, 2004, these revisions were
allowed holding that the transfer of land by the perpetual land
holder Rodrigues in favour of Dennis Torry on 8th September,
1977 was illegal and without force of law and thus, mutation
of land in favour of Dennis Torry was illegal. The transfer and
consequent mutation in favour of Sanjay Bhandari and Shri

the District Collector vide order dated 9th August, 2004.
5.2 The aforesaid order was challenged by the purchasers by filing

Pradesh is with respect to the identification of the land owned by the
applicant contending that the same forms a part of the Pachmarhi
Wildlife Sanctuary. Considering the above contention, this Court
raised the following query on 22nd November, 2023: -
“2. We, therefore, direct the Collector, Hosangabad to file
an affidavit annexing therewith a map of the aforesaid area
of 395.939 hectares and also specify as to whether the
land belonging to the applicant(s) is within those 395.939
hectares or beyond that area.”
9. In compliance of the said direction, an affidavit has been filed on
behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh(also referred to as, ‘compliance
affidavit’). The relevant portions thereof are extracted hereinbelow: -
“2. That, this Hon’ble Court has raised following queries
to the respondent/State of M.P.:-

hectares or beyond that area.
In respect of aforesaid, it is pertinent to mention here that
the Collector, Hoshangabad vide affidavit dated 06.01.2024
stated that the land mentioned, NazulBhumi Sheet No.20,
Plot No.14/3 and 14/4, area 59255 sq. ft. and 49365 sq.

recorded as maintenance Khasra in the Government of
M.P. The plot No.14/3, 14/4 is within the area of 395.939
hectares which was excluded from the Panchmarhi
Wildlife Sanctuary.
2. That, it is respectfully submitted that in respect of Plot

Officer, Revenue, Pipariya whereby it was reported that Plot
No.14/3 and 14/4 are recorded in name of State of M.P. in

8. That, on 03.01.2014, the Hon’ble High Court of M.P. at
Jabalpur passed an order in W.P. No.8098/2018 in petition
filed by Kripa Tori and others challenging the order dated
15.03.2011 of the Board of Revenue. The Hon’ble High
Court set aside the order dated 15.03.2011 and thereby
restored the previous order dated 22.07.1995 whereby the
order of the Nazul Adhikari had been affirmed.
A true copy of the order dated 03.01.2014 passed by the
Hon’ble High Court of M.P. at Jabalpur in Writ Petition
No.8098/2011 is being marked and filed herewith as
Annexure A-9.
It is pertinent to mention here that the aforesaid order
dated 03.01.2014 of the Hon’ble High Court is in respect
of Plot No.14/1 and 14/2 whereas the applicant herein is
claiming relief in respect of Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 which
were purchased by Ashutosh S/o Shriram Shewalkar and
M/s Shewalkar Developers Pvt. Ltd. on 13.09.1991. The
said Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 at present are recorded in the
name of State of M.P. as Nazul Land. The State of Madhya
being aggrieved with the order dated 03.01.2014 has
filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble
High Court which is pending adjudication as Writ Appeal
No.2100/2019.

Zone” and the Plot No.14/3 and 14/4 fall within the
notified boundaries of said notification.
11. That, in view of notification dated 09.08.2017 “no
new resort can be constructed and only repairs etc. can
be done”. Moreover, the Hon’ble High Courtvide interim
order dated 01.11.2002 in W.P. No.5937/2002 stayed the
construction by making following observation:-
“Subject to hearing other side, further construction in and
around Pachmarhi Hill Resort is stayed till further order”.
The aforesaid clarification about stay order being
applicable only to new construction has been reiterated
by the Hon’ble High Court in its order dated 22.01.2004
in following words:-
“By further order dated 13.07.2004, the interim order was
clarified that the order of stay will not come in the way
of repairing of roads by the State or carrying out repairs
to existing building by respective provided, however, that
repairs work of any building can be undertaken only after
taking due permission from the concerned authority.””
(emphasis supplied)
10. Shri D.S. Naidu, learned senior counsel representing the applicant
drew the Court’s attention to the order dated 15th December, 2000
passed by the Department Officer(SDO), Pipariya on the application
preferred by the applicant seeking mutation based on a registered sale
deed dated 13th September, 1991 executed by the land owner Dennis
Torry in favour of the applicant. The SDO accepted the said application
taking note of the fact that Plot No.14 admeasuring 3,23,365 sq.
ft. was entered in the name of Dennis Torry who sought and was
granted permission to sell the plot in question, by the Government
of Madhya Pradesh vide order dated 1st May, 1991. Thereafter, by
a registered sale deed dated 13th September, 1991, Dennis Torry
had sold the subject plots of land to Ashutosh Shewalkar on behalf
of the applicant company. Consequently, the SDO directed that the
land sold by Dennis Torry should be mutated in the name of M/s
Shewalkar Developers Ltd. through Ashutosh Shewalkar, resident
of Nagpur. There is no dispute that the aforesaid order passed by
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 737
T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India & Ors.
the jurisdictional Revenue Officer in favour of the applicant has not
been questioned in any Court of law.
11. Shri Naidu also drew the Court’s attention to the report of the CEC
dated 16th June, 2020, as per which the permission to construct
has been denied to the applicant on the ground that the State of
Madhya Pradesh had filed an affidavit stating that the land falls in the
Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary and that the same had been purchased
in violation of the provisions of the Wild Life(Protection) Act, 1972.
12. Shri Naidu contended that this objection raised by the State with
reference to the Eco Sensitive Zone(hereinafter being referred to
as ‘ESZ’) notification dated 9th August, 2017 is totally against the
material available on record. He drew the Court’s attention to the
site map dated 26th December, 2023(Annexure A-1 annexed with the
compliance affidavit dated 12th February, 2024 filed by the respondent-
State of Madhya Pradesh) to contend that as a matter of fact, the
land owned by the applicant is located right on the periphery of the
Nazul land, at a distance of about 10 kms. from the forest area and
therefore, the same is well beyond the ESZ area.
13. Shri Naidu further submitted that in view of the categoric assertion
made in the compliance affidavit dated 12th February, 2024, filed on
behalf of the State, it is clear that the plots in question are located in
the urban area of Pachmarhi and thus, there is no question of these
plots being covered either under the wildlife sanctuary or the ESZ
area. He thus urged that the applicant deserves the relief sought for.
14. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents have
opposed the submissions advanced by Mr. Naidu. Learned counsel
for the State of Madhya Pradesh urged that the plots in question
are subject matter of litigation in the writ appeal pending before the
Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court and thus, the
applicant should await the outcome of the aforesaid writ appeal
before seeking permission to construct the health/eco-resort on the
land in question.
15. His further contention was that the plots in question are recorded in
the name of the State of Madhya Pradesh and hence, the applicant
cannot claim any right thereupon.
16. Mr. K. Parameshwar, learned Amicus Curiae appearing on behalf
of the CEC submitted that in view of the ESZ notification dated 9th
738 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
August, 2017, permission to raise a new construction on the land in
question cannot be granted and whatever permissions are sought
for, have to be routed through the CEC.
17. Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India adopted the
submissions advanced by the standing counsel for the State and
learned Amicus Curiae.
18. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions
advanced at bar and have gone through the material placed on record.
19. It is not in dispute that the applicant herein was never impleaded
in any of the proceedings before the Revenue Courts or the High
Court as has been emphatically stated in Para-9 of the compliance
affidavit dated 12th February, 2024. It is thus, clear that irrespective
of the fact that the order passed by the District Collector dated 9th
August, 2004, purportedly covers entire area of the Plot No. 14 and
the transactions done in favour of and by Dennis Torry, the sale deed
executed in favour of the applicant and the mutation made in its name
had never been questioned in any Court of law. Neither the Revenue
Department nor the State Government authorities took the trouble
of impleading the applicant as party in any of the abovementioned
litigations. The title acquired by the applicant over the subject plots
not having been challenged, attainted finality and thus the State
cannot claim a right thereupon simply because at some point of
time, the plots came to be recorded as Nazul lands in the revenue
records. The categoric stand in the compliance affidavit filed by the
State(reproduced supra) fortifies the claim of the applicant that these
plots are falling under the urban area.
20. In this background, the applicant is justified in claiming that its
proprietary rights guaranteed under Article 300A of the Constitution
of India cannot be infringed merely on account of the pending writ
appeal before the Madhya Pradesh High Court.
21. Resultantly, we are of the firm opinion that the permission sought
by the applicant for raising construction of health/eco-resort cannot
be opposed only on account of pendency of the writ appeal before
the Madhya Pradesh High Court. However, it can be said without a
cavil of doubt that activities, if any, on the Plot Nos. 14/3 and 14/4
purchased by the applicant from Dennis Torry would have to be
carried out strictly in accordance with the ESZ notification dated 9th
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 739
T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India & Ors.
August, 2017, issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and
Climate Change. Nonetheless, the applicant would be at liberty
to satisfy the authorities that the plots in question are beyond the
Eco-Sensitive Zone.
22. Furthermore, since the writ appeal pending before the Madhya
Pradesh High Court arises out of the orders passed in relation to the
title rights of Dennis Torry, from whom the applicant purchased the
plots in question, the activities, if any, undertaken by the applicant
on the said plot of land would also remain subject to the outcome
of the said writ appeal.
23. We, therefore, direct that the application filed by the applicant for
raising construction on plot Nos. 14/3 and 14/4 shall be decided
objectively by the CEC/Competent Authority of the local body
keeping in view the location of the land with reference to the notified
boundaries of the ESZ.
24. While deciding the application filed by the applicant, the authorities
shall also bear in mind the fact that it is the pertinent case presented
before this Court that a large number of resorts of Madhya Pradesh
Tourism Development Corporation and Special Area Development
Authority(SADA) are existing on areas abutting the land owned by
the applicant.
25. The application/s shall be decided within a period of two months
from today. Needless to say, that in the event of any adverse orders
being passed, the applicant shall be at liberty to challenge the same
as per law.
26. The applications are disposed of in above terms. No order as to costs.

[Sudhanshu Dhulia* and S.V.N. Bhatti, JJ.]","Whether “ghee” is a “product of livestock” under the provisions of
the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets
Act, 1966 and; whether the Government 1994 notification, which
inter alia notified “ghee” as one of the products of livestock for the
purpose of regulation of purchase and sale of “ghee” in all notified
market areas was published after due compliance of the procedure
contemplated under the provisions of the Act.
","Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets
Act, 1966 – “Ghee” if a “product of livestock”:
Held: Yes – The argument that “ghee” is not a product of livestock
is baseless, and bereft of any logic – The contrary argument
that “ghee” is indeed a product of livestock is logically sound –
Livestock has been defined u/s.2(v) of the Act, where Cows and
buffalos are the livestock – Undisputedly, “ghee” is a product of
milk which is a product of the livestock – Reasoning adopted by
the Full Bench of the High Court that ‘Ghee’ is derived out of ‘milk’
by undergoing a process, yet it still remains a product of livestock,
for the purposes of the Act and payment of “market fee”, agreed
with – Further, there was nothing wrong in the 1994 notification
and the challenge to the notification was rightly turned down by
the Full Bench of the High Court – The argument of the appellant
that the procedure given u/s.3 of the Act was not followed, is
not correct – There is a basic difference between the notification
which has to be made u/s.3 of the Act and the notification made
subsequently u/s.4 of the Act – Majority opinion in the Full Bench
concluded that procedural compliance is only necessary when
there is a declaration or later a merger/de-merger of a notified area
and there is no requirement of following any particular procedure

The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors.
while issuing a notification u/s.4 (4) of the Act notifying/de-notifying
any already notified products for the purpose of regulation by any
respective Agricultural Market Committee – Thus, a prior hearing or
prior publication of the draft notification is not a requirement u/s.4
of the Act, since the notification of the year 1994 is a notification
u/s.4 and not of s.3 of the Act – Therefore, the argument that the
process u/s.3, was not followed is totally misconceived – No prior
process was required to be followed as contemplated u/s.3 of the
Act for working the scheme u/s.4 of the Act – Majority decision of
the High Court upheld. [Paras 10 ,11 and 14]
Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets

had an effect which made ‘Ghee’ a product that could be
regulated under provisions of the Act, Market Committees
were empowered to levy fee on the sale and purchase of
‘ghee’ as per s.12 of the Act:
Held: Appellants’ argument that the Market Committees did not
provide any facilities, rejected – Appellants availed the facility
given by the Market Committee and hence are liable to pay the
fee – There may also be a question of unjust enrichment here –
Thus, this market fee should be paid as well – Appellants’ prayer
that respondent Market Committees should be restrained from

","Judgment
Sudhanshu Dhulia, J.
1. Two questions arise in these appeals for our determination. The
first question is whether “ghee” is a “product of livestock” under the
provisions of The Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock)
Markets Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) and the second
would be whether the Government notification (G.O. Ms. No.286 dated
05.07.1994), which inter alia notifies “ghee” as one of the products of
livestock for the purpose of regulation of purchase and sale of “ghee”
in all notified market areas was published after due compliance of the
procedure contemplated under the provisions of the Act?
2. In the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh, the above Act was brought
with the purpose to consolidate and amend the laws regulating the
purchase and sale of agricultural produce, livestock and products
of livestock, along with establishment of markets in connection

therewith. The aim was to secure effective and remunerative price
of commodities by bringing producers and traders face to face
thereby eliminating middlemen and do away with some other earlier
unethical trade practices, which were exploiting agriculturists and
farmers. In other words, it was a farmer friendly legislation. The
commodities which were to be regulated were not only agricultural
produce but also livestock as well as products of livestock. Whereas
livestock has been defined under Section 2(v) and products of
livestock has been defined under Section 2(xv). Both the Sections
are reproduced below:
(v) ‘livestock’ means cows, buffaloes, bullocks, bulls,
goats and sheep, and includes poultry, fish and such
other animals as may be declared by the Government by
notification to be livestock for the purposes of this Act;
(xv) ‘products of livestock’ means such products of
livestock as may be declared by the Government by
notification, to be products of livestock for the purposes
of this Act.
3. Under sub-Section (1) of Section 3 of the Act, the Government has to
initially publish a draft notification declaring its intention of regulating
purchase and sale of proposed notified agricultural produce, livestock
or products of livestock in an area. It is only after hearing objections
from public, it finally publishes its notification under sub-Section (3)
of Section 3 declaring the area to be a ‘notified area’ in respect of
such agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock. Under
Sub-Section (4) of Section 3 the Government also has a power to
exclude from a notified area, any area earlier included in it.
4. After a notification is made under Section 3, there comes the
process of notification under Section 4 of the Act. Under Section
4 (1) of the Act, a process is given wherein the Government
further notifies a market committee for every notified area. Under
Sub Section (3) of Section 4, the market committee is empowered
to establish markets for the purchase and sale of any notified
agricultural produce, livestock or products of livestock. After the
establishment of markets by the market committee under Section 4
(3), the Government declares by a notification under Section 4 (4)1,
1 Section 4 (4) stands omitted vide the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets
(Amendment) Act, 2015.
178 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the ‘notified market area’ for the purposes of the Act in respect of
the notified products.
In short, the above provisions provide that first there will be a larger
physical unit called “notified area” wherein the market committee
shall establish markets and thereafter, through a notification u/s
4 (4), the Govt. declares a “notified market area” in respect of the
notified products.
5. In the year 1968, the State of Andhra Pradesh had issued a
notification u/s 3 (3) of the Act declaring “notified areas” in the State
where “ghee” was included in Schedule II of the said notification
as a livestock product. Thereafter, in the year 1971, a notification
u/s 4 (4) was published, which declared the ‘notified market areas’
in respect of the respondent-committee, i.e. Agricultural Market
Committee, Guntur and “ghee” was specified as a notified product.
However, in 1972 the 1971 notification was amended and “ghee”
was taken out of the list of notified livestock products in respect of
the respondent-committee, and it remained so for a considerable
period of time. We must clarify here that both these notifications
i.e., notifications of 1971 & 1972 were issued u/s 4 (4) of the Act
and not u/s 3 (3) of the Act.
6. Later, on 15.07.1994, the Govt of A.P. published a general notification
directing all the notified markets within the State of AP to regulate all
the products notified in Schedule II of the 1968 Notification, which
also included Ghee.
7. It is this notification of the year 1994 which came to be challenged
by the producers of livestock products and which has now before
us for determination. This notification was challenged before the
Andhra Pradesh High Court on two grounds. The first challenge was
that “ghee” is not a “product of livestock” and therefore cannot be
regulated and notified. The second ground for challenge was that
there is a procedure which is laid down under the law, mainly under
Section 3 of the Act which prescribes the process i.e., first a draft
notification has to be published, objections are invited against the
notification and only after hearing such objections can this notification
be made. It was contended that this process has not been followed
and therefore the notification is bad.
8. This matter ultimately went to a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh
High Court in Writ Petition No. 24818 of 2008 titled Kommisetty
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 179
Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. v.
The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors.
Nammalwar & Co. Guntur v. Agricultural Market Committee, Tenali
& Ors. (2009) SCC OnLine AP 317 and by a 2:1 majority, the Andhra
Pradesh High Court rejected the argument of the appellants and
upheld the notification of the year 1994, holding that the notification
under challenge is not under Section 3 but under Section 4 of the
Act, and is valid and moreover “ghee” is a livestock product. Based
on the said judgment the Writ Petitions filed by the appellants in Civil
Appeal Nos. 6493 of 2014 (M/s Guntur District Milk Production2),
6494 of 2014 (M/s. Lakshmi Das Premji Ghee Merchants), 6496 of
2014 (M/s Durga Dairy Ltd.), 6497 of 2014 (The Krishna District Milk
Producers Co-operative Union Ltd., Vijaywada) & 6498 of 2014 (M/s.
Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Limited) were
also dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The decision of
the Full Bench in Kommisetty Nammalwar (supra) upholding the
validity of the 1994 notification is also under challenge before us in
C.A No.6495 of 2014.
9. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have
perused the material on record.
10. The argument that “ghee” is not a product of livestock is baseless,
and bereft of any logic. The contrary argument that “ghee” is indeed
a product of livestock is logically sound. Livestock has been defined
under Section 2(v) of the Act, where Cows and buffalos are the
livestock. Undisputedly, “ghee” is a product of milk which is a product
of the livestock. The majority opinion of the Full Bench decision in
Kommisetty Nammalwar (supra) while referring to the judgments of
this Court in Park Leather Industry (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2001)
3 SCC 135; Kishan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1990 SC 2269;
Ram Chandra Kailash Kumar v. State of U.P. 1980 Supp (1) SCC
27 and Smt. Sita Devi (Dead) by LRs. v. State of Bihar & Ors.
(1995) Supp (1) SCC 670 held that all animal husbandry products
would fall within the meaning of ‘products of livestock’ as defined
under Section 2 (xv) of the Act. Further, the majority decision has
also held that the inclusion of “ghee” as a livestock product cannot
be faulted merely because it is derived from another dairy product.
It was observed by the High Court that even though “ghee” is not
directly obtained from milk, which is a product of livestock, it would

180 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
still be a “product of a product of livestock”. The relevant portion of
the judgment of the High Court is as under:
“Scientifically or common sense point of view, even though
ghee is not directly obtained from milk (which is certainly a
product of cow/buffalo), it is certainly a product of a product
of livestock i.e., cow or buffalo. It would be rather illogical
or irrational to say that ghee is not a milk/dairy product or
to say that it is not a product of livestock. Ghee is certainly
a product of livestock. It is, therefore, to be seen whether
ghee comes within the definition of product of livestock
or within the meaning of notified product of livestock.
Section 2(x) and 2(xv) of the Act used the plural ‘products
of livestock’. The legislative intention is very clear that not
only a product of livestock like milk (when notified by the
Government), butter etc., are products of livestock but
even derivative items (derived from a product of livestock)
are intended to be product of livestock for the purpose of
the Act. We are convinced that the term ‘ghee’ has to be
interpreted on the basis of expression ‘products of livestock’
as defined in Section 2(xv) of the Act. Whatever products
are declared as such by the Government by notification,
they become products of livestock for purposes of the Act.”
Another case of which a reference must be made here is the decision
taken by this Court in Park Leather Industry (P) LTD. v. State of U.P.
and Others (2001) 3 SCC 135. In this case, the Supreme Court was
dealing with the provisions of U.P. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam,
1964, which has a provision dealing with similar issues as are there
before this Court. In the U.P. Act, “agricultural produce” was widely
defined and it included inter alia produce of animal husbandry which
were specified in the schedule. In the schedule, one of the items
was prescribed under the head “animal husbandry products” was
“hides and skins”. The question was whether tanned leather would
come within the term “hides and skins” or not? This Court held that
the term “tanned leather” can be included under “hides and skins”,
for the purposes of the Act and more importantly for the purposes
of payment of “market fee”. The reason being that although while
making a leather into “tanned leather” a process of cleaning, curing
and adding preservatives may be adopted, yet the finished product
which is “tanned leather” though different in physical appearance or
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 181
Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. v.
The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors.
even chemical combination and even commercially a different item
still remains “leather” and would come under the definition of “hides
and skins”. The same reasoning has been adopted by the Full Bench
of Andhra Pradesh High Court that ‘Ghee’ is derived out of ‘milk’ by
undergoing a process, yet it still remains a product of livestock, for
the purposes of the Act and payment of “market fee”.
We are absolutely in agreement with the above reasoning.
11. The second argument of the appellant that the procedure given under
Section 3 of the Act has not been followed, is also not correct. There
is a basic difference between the notification which has to be made
under Section 3 of the Act and the notification which has to be made
subsequently under Section 4 of the Act. What has to be done under
Section 3 is a one-time measure where the Government notifies an
area where purchase and sale of agricultural produce, livestock and
products of livestock can be made. This is a one-time exercise. What
happens under Section 4 of the Act is that the Govt. declares the ‘notified
market area’ in respect of any notified product (products which have
already been notified under section 3 of the Act). A perusal of Sections
3 and 4 of the Act clearly shows that whereas a draft notification is
mandatory under Section 3 and so is the hearing of objections to the
draft notification, there is no similar provision under Section 4 of the Act.
The two Sections of the Act Section 3 and Section 4 are being
reproduced below for a comparative analysis :

After discussing provisions of Sections 3 & 4 of the Act, the majority
opinion in the Full Bench concluded that procedural compliance is
only necessary when there is a declaration or later a merger/de-
merger of a notified area and there is no requirement of following
any particular procedure while issuing a notification under Section
4 (4) of the Act notifying/de-notifying any already notified products
for the purpose of regulation by any respective Agricultural Market
Committee (AMC). In other words, a prior hearing or prior publication
of the draft notification is not a requirement under Section 4 of the
Act, since the notification of the year 1994 is a notification under
Section 4 and not of Section 3 of the Act. Therefore, the argument
that the process under Section 3, has not been followed is totally
misconceived. No prior process was required to be followed as
contemplated under Section 3 of the Act for working the scheme
under Section 4 of the Act. Consequently, we hold that there was
nothing wrong in the 1994 notification and the challenge to the
notification has rightly been turned down by the Full Bench of the
Andhra Pradesh High Court.

[2024] 3 S.C.R. 185
Sangam Milk Producer Company Ltd. v.
The Agricultural Market Committee & Ors.
12. We are now left with one more issue related to the market fee. Since
the 1994 notification had an effect which made ‘Ghee’ a product that
could be regulated under provisions of the Act, Market Committees
were empowered to levy fee on the sale and purchase of ‘ghee’ as
per section 12 of the Act. During the pendency of the matter before
the High Court, the appellants were not required to pay market fee
as they were granted interim protection by the High Court. After the
majority decision of the High Court in Kommissetty Nammalwar
(Supra), market committees started issuing demand notices to the
producers of ‘Ghee’ asking them to pay fees from the date of the
notification in the year 1994 to the date of the High Court judgment
i.e. 01.05.2009. This issue was also raised by appellants in the
present appeals and it was prayed that they should be exempted
from paying the fee to the market committees prior to the High Court
judgment. This Court while issuing the notices in present matters,
vide interim order, restrained market committees from collecting the
market fees for the period prior to the High Court judgment. Even
some of the present appeals were heard on this limited question.
13. As per section 4(2) of the Act, the Market Committee has the duty
to enforce the provisions of the Act within a notified area. Section
4(3), which empowers Market Committees to establish markets within
the notified area, also directs that these Market Committees have to
provide facilities in the markets for the purchase and sale of notified
products. Appellants’ argument that these Market Committees did
not provide any facilities has already been dealt with and rejected
by the High Court and we are also of the same view as that taken
by the High Court. The appellants have availed the facility given
by the Market Committee and hence they are liable to pay the fee.
There may also be a question of unjust enrichment here. For all
these reasons, we are of the opinion that this market fee should
be paid as well. The appellants’ prayer that Respondent Market
Committees should be restrained from collecting market fees prior
to the date of the High Court Judgment cannot be accepted. All the
same, since this fee which has now accumulated for more than 14
years between 05.07.1994 to 01.05.2009 may entail some hardship
on the appellants, they shall be permitted to deposit this fee with the
Committee within two years from today, in four equal instalments.
14. Consequently, we dismiss these appeals and uphold the majority
decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The interim orders
186 [2024] 3 S.C.R.

passed by this Court in the present batch of cases where we had
restrained the respondents from collecting market fees prior to
the date of the High Court judgment during the pendency of these
appeals, stand vacated.

Prashant Kumar Mishra, J.
The petitioner has preferred this Review Petition seeking review
of the Order dated 13.03.2019 passed in Civil Appeal No. 6567
of 2014 wherein the present petitioner was the respondent. In the
Order under review, the Civil Appeal was allowed, and the judgment
and decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana on
27.11.2007 in Civil Regular Second Appeal No. 2191 of 1985 was
set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the District
Judge, Sangrur, on 06.06.1985 in Civil Appeal No. 27 of 1983 has
been restored.
2. In the judgment under review, this Court held that the judgment and
decree passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court is beyond
the scope and ambit of Section 100 of Code of Civil Procedure,
19081 on the ground that in exercise of such power, the High Court
could not have reappreciated the entire evidence on record to
unsettle the finding of facts recorded by the First Appellate Court,
by substituting its own opinion for that of the First Appellate Court.

directed that the review petition be listed before the open Court for
hearing and subsequently on 13.08.2019 notices were issued to the
opposite parties, at the same time, directing the parties to maintain
status quo.
4. In substance, the main ground for review of the judgment is that the
Constitution Bench of this Court in Pankajakshi (supra) have uphold
the validity of Section 41 of Punjab Courts Act, 19183, overruling this
Court’s earlier judgment in case of Kulwant Kaur & Ors. v. Gurdial
Singh Maan (Dead) By Lrs. & Ors.4 holding that since Section
97(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 has
no application to Section 41 of the Punjab Act, therefore, Section 41
of the Punjab Act would necessarily continue as a law in force and
the second appeal before the High Court has to be heard within the
parameters of Section 41 of the Punjab Act, and not under Section
100 CPC.
5. Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner
would also refer to the subsequent judgments of this Court in Randhir
Kaur v. Prithvi Pal Singh & Ors.5 and Gurbachan Sing (Dead)
Through Lrs. v. Gurcharan Singh (Dead) Through Lrs. & Ors.6
wherein this Court relying upon Pankajakshi (supra) held that the
scope of interference within the jurisdiction of the Punjab and Haryana
High Court would be the same as under Section 100 of CPC as it
existed prior to the 1976 amendment. The provisions of Section 41
of the Punjab Act and of Section 100 CPC, before its amendment
in 1976, are in pari materia. Therefore, the questions of law are not
required to be framed in second appeal before Punjab and Haryana
High Court whose jurisdiction in second appeal is circumscribed by
provision of Section 41 of the Punjab Act.
6. Shri Patwalia would submit that this Court has set aside the Judgment

to the property by way of natural succession and the finding of the
High Court that the Will relied upon by the respondents has not been
proved as it is surrounded by suspicious circumstances ought not to
have been interfered by this Court. It is argued that a finding of fact
erroneously or perversely recorded by the First Appellate Court can
always be interfered by the High Court. Hence, there is no infirmity
in the Judgment rendered by the High Court and the same ought not
to have been interfered by this Court while deciding the Civil Appeal
No. 6567 of 2014 on an erroneous ground that the High Court has
travelled beyond its jurisdiction and power under Section 100 CPC
as it stands of the 1976 amendment.
7. Shri Manoj Swarup, learned senior counsel appearing for the
respondents would not dispute the legal position as has been settled
by this Court in the matter of Pankajakshi (supra). However, he
would submit that even in the case when the High Court would
exercise the power under Section 41 of the Punjab Act, the finding
of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court cannot be interfered on
re-appreciation of evidence to substitute its own decision for that of
the First Appellate Court. According to him, the finding recorded by
the First Appellate Court was borne out from the record. Therefore,
the High Court erred in interfering with the said finding, and this
Court rightly set aside the Judgment and decree of the High Court
while deciding the Civil Appeal. According to Shri Swarup, the
respondents had proved the Will, which was a registered one, in
accordance with law and that there were no suspicious circumstances
accompanying the Will.
8. When this Court rendered the judgment under review in Civil Appeal
No. 6567 of 2014, the only ground which weighed with the Court
was that the High Court exercised the power under Section 100
CPC erroneously and decided the second appeal by re-appreciating
the evidence without even framing a substantial question of law.
9. The second appeal in Punjab and Haryana High Court is heard
under Section 41 of the Punjab Act, which is reproduced hereunder
for ready reference: -
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 395
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
“41. Second Appeals – (1) An appeal shall lie to the
High Court from every decree passed in appeal by
any court subordinate to the High Court on any of the
following grounds, namely:
(a) the decision being contrary to law or to
some custom or usage having the force
of law:
(b) the decision having failed to determine
some material issue of law or custom or
usage having the force of law:
(c) a substantial error or defect in the
procedure provided by the Code of Civil
Procedure 1908 (V of 1908), or by any
other law for the time being in force which
may possibly have produced error or
defect in the decision of the case upon
the merits;
[Explanation – A question relating to the
existence or validity of a custom or usage shall
be deemed to be a question of law within the
meaning of this section:]
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an
appellate decree passed ex parte.”
10. The provision contained in Section 41 of the Punjab Act, as
reproduced above, does not mandate framing of a substantial
question of law for entertaining the second appeal. Therefore, a
second appeal under Section 41 of Punjab Act can be entertained
by the Punjab and Haryana High Court even without framing a
substantial question of law.
11. It would be appropriate to refer to the provision contained in Section
41 of the Punjab Act in juxtaposition to Section 100 CPC, before its
amendment in 1976, to appreciate and understand the jurisdiction
of Punjab and Haryana High Court in second appeal. The provisions
are reproduced hereunder for ready reference: -

12. In Pankajakshi (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court has held
that substantial question of law may not be required to be framed in
a second appeal before Punjab and Haryana High Court. However,
the finding of fact recorded, cannot be interfered with even in terms
of Section 41 of Punjab Act. The law laid down by this Court in
Pankajakshi (supra) has been relied upon in Randhir Kaur (supra)
to hold thus in paragraphs 10 to 12: -
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 397
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
“10. The effect of the Constitution Bench judgment
in Pankajakshi is that in second appeal, the scope of
interference within the Punjab and Haryana High Court
would be the same as the Code of Civil Procedure
existed prior to the 1976 Amendment. The provisions
of Section 41 of the Punjab Act and of Section 100
CPC are in pari materia.
11. Some of the judgments of this Court dealing with
the scope of the old Section 100 are required to be
discussed. In a judgment in Deity Pattabhiramaswamy
v. S. Hanymayya [AIR 1959 SC 57] — three Judges,
while examining the scope of Section 100 CPC, held
as under : (AIR p. 59, para 13)
“13. The finding on the title was arrived at by
the learned District Judge not on the basis of
any document of title but on a consideration
of relevant documentary and oral evidence
adduced by the parties. The learned Judge,
therefore, in our opinion, clearly exceeded his
jurisdiction in setting aside the said finding.
The provisions of Section 100 are clear and
unambiguous. As early as in 1891, the Judicial
Committee in Durga Choudhrain v. Jawahir
Singh Choudhri [1890 SCC OnLine PC 10 :
(1889-90) 17 IA 122] stated thus : (SCC OnLine
PC)
‘There is no jurisdiction to entertain a second
appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding
of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error
may seem to be.’
The principle laid down in this decision has
been followed in innumerable cases by the Privy
Council as well as by different High Courts in
this country. Again the Judicial Committee in
Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. v. Uma Charan
Mandal [1923 SCC OnLine PC 31 : (1924-25)
29 CWN 131] further elucidated the principle
by pointing out : (SCC OnLine PC)
398 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
‘[If] the question to be decided is one of fact, it
does not involve an issue of law merely because
documents which were not instruments of title
or contracts or statutes or otherwise the direct
foundations of rights but were merely historical
documents, have to be construed.’
Nor does the fact that the finding of the
first appellate court is based upon some
documentary evidence make it any the less a
finding of fact (see Wali Mohammad v. Mohd.
Bakhsh [1929 SCC OnLine PC 115 : (1929-
30) 57 IA 86 : ILR (1930) 11 Lah 199]). But,
notwithstanding such clear and authoritative
pronouncements on the scope of the provisions
of Section 100 CPC, some learned Judges of
the High Courts are disposing of second appeals
as if they were first appeals. This introduces,
apart from the fact that the High Court assumes
and exercises a jurisdiction which it does not
possess, a gambling element in the litigation
and confusion in the mind of the litigant public.
This case affords a typical illustration of such
interference by a Judge of the High Court in
excess of his jurisdiction under Section 100
CPC. We have, therefore, no alternative but to
set aside the decree of the High Court on the
simple ground that the learned Judge of the High
Court had no jurisdiction to interfere in second
appeal with the findings of fact given by the first
appellate court based upon an appreciation of
the relevant evidence. In the result, the decree
of the High Court is set aside and the appeal
is allowed with costs throughout.”
12. Later, in a judgment, in Kshitish Chandra Bose v.
Commr. [(1981) 2 SCC 103] — three Judges, of this
Court held that the High Court has no jurisdiction to
entertain second appeal on findings of fact even if it
was erroneous. The Court held as follows : (SCC p.
108, para 11)
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 399
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
“11. On a perusal of the first judgment of the
High Court we are satisfied that the High Court
clearly exceeded its jurisdiction under Section
100 in reversing pure concurrent findings of fact
given by the trial court and the then appellate
court both on the question of title and that
of adverse possession. In Kharbuja Kuer v.
Jangbahadur Rai [AIR 1963 SC 1203 : (1963)
1 SCR 456] this Court held that the High Court
had no jurisdiction to entertain second appeal
on findings of fact even if it was erroneous. In
this connection, this Court observed as follows :
(AIR pp. 1205-06, paras 5 & 7)
‘5. It is settled law that the High Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the
ground of erroneous finding of fact. …
***
7. … As the two courts approached the evidence
from a correct perspective and gave a concurrent
finding of fact, the High Court had no jurisdiction
to interfere with the said finding.’
To the same effect is another decision of this
Court in V. Ramachandra Ayyar v. Ramalingam
Chettiar [AIR 1963 SC 302 : (1963) 3 SCR 604]
where the Court observed as follows : (AIR p.
306, para 12)
‘12. … But the High Court cannot interfere with
the conclusions of fact recorded by the lower
appellate court, however erroneous the said
conclusions may appear to be to the High Court,
because, as the Privy Council has observed,
however gross or inexcusable the error may
seem to be, there is no jurisdiction under Section
100 to correct that error.’ ”
13. In a recent decision in the matter of Gurbachan Singh (supra),
this court has reiterated the legal position vis-à-vis Section 41 of
Punjab Act and the unamended Section 100 CPC holding thus in
paragraphs 9 to 11: -
400 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“9. The Constitution bench in Pankajakshi (Dead)
through LRs v. Chandrika had held Kulwant Kaur v.
Gurdial Singh Mann which held section 41 of the Punjab
Courts Act, 1918 to be repugnant to section 100, CPC
to be bad in law, thereby implying that section 41 of
the Punjab Court Act holds as good law. It was held
as under: —
“25. We are afraid that this judgment in Kulwant
Kaur case [Kulwant Kaur v. Gurdial Singh
Mann, (2001) 4 SCC 262] does not state the
law correctly on both propositions. First and
foremost, when Section 97(1) of the Code of Civil
Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 speaks of
any amendment made or any provision inserted
in the principal Act by virtue of a State Legislature
or a High Court, the said section refers only to
amendments made and/or provisions inserted
in the Code of Civil Procedure itself and not
elsewhere. This is clear from the expression
“principal Act” occurring in Section 97(1). What
Section 97(1) really does is to state that where
a State Legislature makes an amendment in the
Code of Civil Procedure, which amendment will
apply only within the four corners of the State,
being made under Schedule VII List III Entry 13
to the Constitution of India, such amendment
shall stand repealed if it is inconsistent with the
provisions of the principal Act as amended by
the Parliamentary enactment contained in the
1976 Amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure.
This is further made clear by the reference in
Section 97(1) to a High Court. The expression
“any provision inserted in the principal Act” by a
High Court has reference to Section 122 of the
Code of Civil Procedure by which High Courts
may make rules regulating their own procedure,
and the procedure of civil courts subject to their
superintendence, and may by such rules annul,
alter, or add to any of the rules contained in the
First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure.”
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 401
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
10. Recently, a Bench of three learned Judges in
Satyender v. Saroj while dealing with a property
dispute arising out of the State of Haryana, held as
under:—
“16. We may also add here that we are presently
concerned with the laws in the State of Haryana.
All the same, the laws as applicable in Punjab
in the year 1918, were also applicable to the
present territory of Haryana since it was then
a part of the State of Punjab. Later on, the
creation of the new State of Haryana, under
the provision given in Section 88 of the Punjab
Re-organization Act, 1966, the laws applicable
in the erstwhile State of Punjab continued to
be applicable in the new State of Haryana.
Furthermore, State of Haryana formally adopted
the laws of the erstwhile State of Punjab, under
Section 89 of the Punjab Re-Organisation
Act, 1966. Therefore, in the State of Haryana
a court in second appeal is not required to
formulate a substantial question of law, as what
is applicable in Haryana is Section 41 of the
Punjab Courts Act, 1918 and not Section 100
of CPC. Consequently, it was not necessary
for the High Court to formulate a substantial
question of law.”
11. In view of the above discussion, it is clear to this
court that the judgment of the learned single Judge
sitting in second appellate jurisdiction cannot be
faulted for not having framed substantial questions
of law under section 100, CPC”.
14. Regard being had to the settled legal position in Pankajakshi (supra)
reiterated in Randhir Kaur (supra) and Gurbachan Singh (supra),
we are of the view that the Judgment of this Court under review in
Civil Appeal No. 6567 of 2014 has been wrongly decided holding
that the Punjab and Haryana High Court has travelled beyond the
jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC by interfering with the finding of
fact recorded by the First Appellate Court without framing a substantial
question of law.
402 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
15. Since there is an error apparent on the face of the record, in view of
the law laid down in Pankajakshi (supra), we review our judgment
in Civil Appeal No. 6567 of 2014 and recall the same for deciding
the Civil Appeal on merits. The Review Petition is allowed. The Civil
Appeal is restored to its original number and taken on board with the
consent of the parties, and we proceed to decide the Civil Appeal
afresh on merits.
Civil Appeal No. 6567 of 2014
16. This Civil Appeal is preferred by the defendants in the suit against
whom the plaintiff brought a suit for perpetual injunction on the
pleadings, inter alia, that he and his brother Bhagwan Singh alias
Nikka Singh were owners in possession of the suit land. Bhagwan
Singh was issueless being unmarried. Since the defendant No. 1
was trying to dispossess the plaintiff forcibly, the suit for perpetual
injunction was filed. The defendants did not deny that plaintiff and
Bhagwan Singh were real brothers. However, he claimed to be the
half-brother of Bhagwan Singh as they were given birth by same lady
namely Mrs. Har Kaur who was earlier married to Sunder Singh but
after his death, she was married to Mehar Singh and the defendant
no. 1 was born out of the wedlock of Har Kaur with Mehar Singh. The
defendant’s case rested on a Will allegedly executed by Bhagwan
Singh on 17.01.1980. Prior to this, Bhagwan Singh had executed an
unregistered Will on 17.08.1979. However, the defendant admitted
that during the lifetime of Bhagwan Singh, the suit land was cultivated
jointly by the plaintiff and Bhagwan Singh. In the alternative, the
defendant pleaded that if plaintiff’s possession over the suit land is
proved, the defendant nos. 2 to 6, the beneficiary of the Will, are
entitled to joint possession of half share of the suit land.
17. On the strength of evidence adduced by the parties in course of
trial, it was held by the trial court that the defendants have failed to
prove the genuineness of the Will, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled
to succeed by way of natural succession. It was found that the Will
relied by the defendants is surrounded by suspicious circumstances,
therefore, it is not a validly executed Will. The trial court held that
the defendants’ case that they served the deceased Bhagwan Singh
during the lifetime and out of love and affection for the services
rendered, he executed the Will in their favour as they were also
related to the deceased, has not been believed by the trial court.
There is evidence that it was plaintiff who admitted Nikka Singh in
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 403
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
hospital on 02.08.1979 when he was ill and his address was also
shown as care of Lehna Singh (the ‘plaintiff’).
18. Upon careful marshalling of evidence, the trial court recorded a finding
about active participation of Jagjit Singh (DW-3) in execution of the Will
and the absence of mention in the Will as to why he disinherited his
real brother, the plaintiff, from succeeding the property and more so
when he was living with him and was attended to during his ill health.
Since the defendant admit joint possession and cultivation of the land
by Nikka Singh and plaintiff, a fact contrary to this mentioned in the
Will was also highlighted by the trial court. Despite there being an
earlier Will there was no mention that the said Will is cancelled and
the name of father of Gurnam Singh was also wrongly mentioned.
The trial court also found that Nikka Singh was suffering from cancer
and was also a patient of T.B.
19. The trial court also found that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit
land as the said fact has been admitted by one of the defendant’s
witnesses namely Gurnam Singh.
20. The First Appellate Court set aside the finding of the trial court
holding that the trial court was wrongly persuaded by insignificant
circumstances to hold that the Will in favour of the defendant nos. 2 to
6 is not genuine and that it is surrounded by suspicious circumstances.
The First Appellate Court eventually passed a decree for joint
possession in favour of defendant which was assailed by plaintiff
Lehna Singh before the High Court by preferring an appeal under
Section 41 of the Punjab Act. The High Court, under the impugned
Judgment, allowed the appeal, set aside the appellate decree passed
by the District Judge, Sangrur, restoring the Judgment and decree
passed by the trial court.
21. The High Court has discussed the evidence threadbare and framed
the following substantial questions of law: -
(i) Whether the Appellate Court can reverse the
findings recorded by the learned trial court
without adverting to the specific finding of the
trial court?
(ii) Whether the judgment passed by the learned
lower Appellate Court is perverse and outcome
of misreading of evidence?
404 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
22. The High Court answered both the questions of law in favour of
the plaintiff/respondent herein (in Civil Appeal) on the reasoning
that when the person entitled to the property of the deceased by
way of natural succession, is disinherited from the property without
giving any reason and the covenants in the Will are also found to be
factually incorrect, mere registration of the Will and proof of the same
by attesting witnesses could not be treated to be sufficient to over-
come the suspicious circumstances as has been done by the First
Appellate Court. The High Court also observed that the propounders
of the Will were earlier tried for murder of the deceased-testator and
there being no evidence on record to show that the deceased had
special love and affection with the defendants and when it is proved
that the plaintiff is in possession of the land and the defendant and
their witnesses actively participated in the execution of the Will,
there is glaring suspicious circumstances to hold that the Will is not
genuine. It was also observed that the testator was residing with the
plaintiff, and it was he who got him admitted in the hospital, it was
proved that the plaintiff was taking care of the deceased at the time
of his need. Merely because the attesting witnesses had no enmity
towards the plaintiff, it cannot dispel the suspicious circumstances
surrounded around the Will.
23. It is settled law that the First Appellate Court, while setting aside
the Judgment and decree of the trial court, is required to meet the
reasoning given by the trial court in rejecting the Will, which in the
present case has not been done by the First Appellate Court.
24. The requirement of exercise of jurisdiction by the First Appellate
Court under Section 96 of CPC has been dealt with by this Court in
Chintamani Ammal vs. Nandagopal Gounder and Anr.7, wherein
after noticing the previous judgments of this Court, the following has
been held in paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 thus: -
“18. Furthermore, when the learned trial Judge
arrived at a finding on the basis of appreciation of
oral evidence, the first appellate court could have
reversed the same only on assigning sufficient reasons
therefor. Save and except the said statement of DW 2,
7 [2007] 2 SCR 903 : (2007) 4 SCC 163
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 405
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
the learned Judge did not consider any other materials
brought on record by the parties.
19. In Madholal Sindhu v. Official Assignee of Bombay,
it was observed: (AIR p. 30, para 21)
“It is true that a judge of first instance can
never be treated as infallible in determining on
which side the truth lies and like other tribunals
he may go wrong on questions of fact, but
on such matters if the evidence as a whole
can reasonably be regarded as justifying the
conclusion arrived at, the appeal court should
not lightly interfere with the judgment.”
(See also Madhusudan Das v. Narayanibai)
20. In Rajbir Kaur v. S. Chokesiri and Co., this Court
observed: (SCC pp. 39-41, paras 48-52)
“48. Reference on the point could also usefully be
made to A.L. Goodhart’s article in which, the learned
author points out:
‘A judge sitting without a jury must perform
dual function. The first function consists in the
establishment of the particular facts. This may be
described as the perceptive function. It is what
you actually perceive by the five senses. It is a
datum of experience as distinct from a conclusion.
It is obvious that, in almost all cases tried
by a judge without a jury, an appellate court,
which has not had an opportunity of seeing
the witnesses, must accept his conclusions of
fact because it cannot tell on what grounds he
reached them and what impression the various
witnesses made on him.’
49. The following is the statement of the same
principle in ‘The Supreme Court Practice’:
‘Great weight is due to the decision of a judge of
first instance whenever, in a conflict of testimony,
406 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the demeanour and manner of witnesses who
have been seen and heard by him are material
elements in the consideration of the truthfulness
of these statements. But the parties to the cause
are nevertheless entitled as well on questions of
fact as on questions of law to demand the decision
of the court of appeal, and that court cannot
excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting
evidence, and drawing its own conclusions,
though it should always bear in mind that it has
neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should
make due allowance in this respect. (pp. 854-55)
…Not to have seen witnesses puts Appellate
Judges in a permanent position of disadvantage
against the trial Judge, and unless it can be
shown that he has failed to use or has palpably
misused his advantage—for example has failed
to observe inconsistencies or indisputable fact
or material probabilities (ibid. and Yuill v. Yuill;
Watt v. Thomas —the higher court ought not
take the responsibility of reversing conclusions
so arrived at merely as the result of their own
comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses,
and of their view of the probabilities of the case.
… (p. 855)
…But while the court of appeal is always
reluctant to reject a finding by a judge of the
specific or primary facts deposed to by the
witnesses, especially when the finding is based
on the credibility or bearing of a witness, it is
willing to form an independent opinion upon the
proper inference to be drawn from it. … (p. 855)
50. A consideration of this aspect would be incomplete
without a reference to the observations of B.K.
Mukherjea, J., in Sarju Pershad Ramdeo Sahu v.
Jwaleshwari Pratap Narain Singh [1950 SCC 714 :
AIR 1951 SC 120 : 1950 SCR 781] which as a succinct
statement of the rule, cannot indeed be bettered:
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 407
Lehna Singh (D) By Lrs. v. Gurnam Singh (D) By Lrs. & Ors.
‘The question for our consideration is undoubtedly
one of fact, the decision of which depends upon
the appreciation of the oral evidence adduced
in the case. In such cases, the appellate court
has got to bear in mind that it has not the
advantage which the trial Judge had in having
the witnesses before him and of observing the
manner in which they deposed in court. This
certainly does not mean that when an appeal
lies on facts, the appellate court is not competent
to reverse a finding of fact arrived at by the trial
Judge. The rule is— and it is nothing more than
a rule of practice—that when there is conflict
of oral evidence of the parties on any matter
in issue and the decision hinges upon the
credibility of the witnesses, then unless there
is some special feature about the evidence of
a particular witness which has escaped the trial
Judge’s notice or there is a sufficient balance
of improbability to displace his opinion as to
where the credibility lies, the appellate court
should not interfere with the finding of the trial
Judge on a question of fact.
51. The area in which the question lies in the present
case is the area of the perceptive functions of the
trial Judge where the possibility of errors of inference
does not play a significant role. The question whether
the statement of the witnesses in regard to what
was amenable to perception by sensual experience
as to what they saw and heard is acceptable or not
is the area in which the well-known limitation on
the powers of the appellate court to reappreciate
the evidence falls. The appellate court, if it seeks
to reverse those findings of fact, must give cogent
reasons to demonstrate how the trial court fell into
an obvious error.
52. With respect to the High Court, we think, that,
what the High Court did was what perhaps even an
appellate court, with full-fledged appellate jurisdiction
408 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
would, in the circumstances of the present case,
have felt compelled to abstain from and reluctant to
do. Contention (c) would also require to be upheld.”
(emphasis in original)
25. In Jagannath v. Arulappa & Anr.8 and H.K.N. Swami v. Irshad
Basith (Dead) By Lrs.9, this Court has opined that it would be
wholly improper to allow first appeal without adverting to the specific
findings of the trial court and that the First Appellate Court is required
to address all the issues and determine the appeal upon assignment
of cogent reasons.
26. Having considered the evidence on record and the findings of the trial
court, the First Appellate Court and the High Court, we are satisfied
that the First Appellate Court wrongly set aside the Judgment, decree,
and findings of the trial court without meeting the findings of the trial
court which could not have been done in exercise of power under
Section 96 CPC. Therefore, the High Court has rightly set aside
the Judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court to restore the
Judgment and decree of the trial court. On independent examination
also, we have found that the findings recorded by trial court are borne
out from the evidence on record and are neither perverse nor illegal.
27. Therefore, we find no substance in this appeal which deserves to
be and is hereby dismissed.
28. The parties shall bear their own costs.
Result of the case: Review Petition allowed and Civil Appeal
dismissed.

The Appellant had issued an invitation for tender for “Construction
of Weir with Allied Structures across river Damodar at DVC, CTPS,
Chandrapura, Dist – Bokaro, Jharkhand in response whereto, the
* Author
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 813
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
Respondent submitted its Techno Commercial Bid. The contract for
the construction of weir was awarded to the Respondent whereafter
due to certain disputes, the Respondent issued a notice in terms
of Clause 3.34 of Section III Volume II of the Tender Documents
invoking arbitration and further seeking consent of the appellant
for the appointment of a former Judge of a High Court, as Sole
Arbitrator. The Respondent, while invoking the arbitration, had
taken recourse to Clause 2 of the Letter of Intent (L.O.I.) issued
by the Appellant while awarding the contract. Clause 2 stated thus:
“All terms and conditions as contained in the tender issued by
DVC to NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis except where these
have been expressly modified by NBCC.” Since the Appellant did
not respond to the notice, the Respondent approached the High
Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996. High Court allowed the petition preferred by the Respondent.
Held: A perusal of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act
itself would reveal that before an arbitration clause could be read
as a part of the contract, there must be a conscious acceptance of
the arbitration clause from another document by the parties – It is
thus clear that a reference to the document in the contract should
be such that shows the intention to incorporate the arbitration clause
contained in the document into the contract. [Paras 12 and 13]
While setting aside the order of the High Court, the Supreme
Court held that a general reference to the terms and conditions
of another contract would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause – It is pertinent to note that clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I. specifically uses the word “Only” before the words “be
through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone” – When
there is a reference in the second contract to the terms and
conditions of the first contract, the arbitration clause would not
ipso facto be applicable to the second contract unless there is
specific mention/reference thereto – The present case is not a
case of ‘incorporation’ but a case of ‘reference’ – As such, a
general reference would not have the effect of incorporating the
arbitration clause – Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I, which is also a part
of the agreement, makes it amply clear that the redressal of the
dispute between NBCC and respondent has to be only through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone – Delhi High Court
has erred in allowing the application of the respondent. [Paras

2. The present appeals challenge the interim order dated 12th March
2021 and final judgment & order dated 9th April 2021, passed by the
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 815
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi (hereinafter, “High
Court”), in Arbitration Petition (Arb. P.) No. 44 of 2021, whereby
the High Court allowed the application under Section 11(6) of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 (hereinafter referred to as, “the
Arbitration Act”) and appointed the Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the
dispute between the parties to the present lis, arising from the Letter
of Intent dated 4th December 2006.
3. Facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeals are as follows:
3.1 The appellant, NBCC (India) Limited (Formerly known as
National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd.), is a Public
Limited Company and Government of India undertaking,
engaged in construction of power plants and other infrastructure
projects on EPC and/or PMC basis.
3.2 The respondent, M/s Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly
known as Durha Constructions Pvt. Ltd.), is a Private Limited
Company, engaged in the construction and infrastructure
sector.
3.3 The appellant issued an invitation for tender, being NIT No.
01-WEIR/06 dated 3rd November 2006, for “Construction of
Weir with Allied Structures across river Damodar at DVC,
CTPS, Chandrapura, Dist – Bokaro, Jharkhand – Package
“A” (hereinafter referred to as, “Construction of the Weir”),
containing inter-alia, the General Conditions of Contract,
Special Conditions of Contract, Bill of Quantity, etc. (collectively
referred to as, “Tender Documents”).
3.4 In response to the aforementioned tender, the Respondent
submitted its Techno Commercial Bid on 16th November 2006.
3.5 On fulfilment of the tender criteria, vide Letter of Intent
No. AGM/RAN/CTPS-AWARD/06/1660 dated 4th December
2006, the appellant awarded the contract for Construction
of the Weir to the respondent for a total value of Rs.
19,08,46,612/-.
3.6 With the passage of time, certain disputes arose between
the parties to the present lis & as a result, the respondent
issued a notice dated 6th March 2020, in terms of Clause
3.34 of Section III Volume II of the Tender Documents (GCC),
816 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
thereby invoking arbitration and further seeking consent of
the appellant for the appointment of a former Judge of a High
Court, as Sole Arbitrator.
3.7 The appellant did not respond to the aforementioned notice
invoking arbitration, so the respondent filed an application
at the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act.
3.8 Vide interim order dated 12th March 2021, the High Court
allowed the Arbitration Petition and proposed the appointment
of a former Judge of the High Court, as the Sole Arbitrator, to
adjudicate the dispute between the parties.
3.9 Vide final judgment & order dated 9th April 2021, the High Court
confirmed the proposed appointment of the former Judge of
the Delhi High Court, as the Sole Arbitrator.
3.10 Aggrieved by the orders of the learned single judge of the
High Court, the appellant filed the present appeals thereby
challenging both the interim order and the final judgement &
order.
3.11 This Court vide order dated 23rd July, 2021, issued notice and
stay of further proceedings of the arbitration was granted.
4. We have heard Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant & Shri Sumit Kumar,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.
5. Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the appellant submits that the High Court has grossly erred in invoking
its power under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that
Clause 2.0 of the Letter of Intent dated 4th December 2006 (“L.O.I.”
for short) though states that all terms and conditions as contained
in the tender issued by the Damodar Valley Corporation (“DVC” for
short) to the NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis, it also makes it clear
that where the terms and conditions have been expressly modified
by the NBCC, the same would not be applicable. It is submitted that
Clause 1.0 of the L.O.I. specifically states that various conditions,
i.e., contractual, financial and technical mentioned in the documents
contained therein shall be binding on the respondent for execution
of works and they shall form part of the agreement. Clause 10.0
also states that the L.O.I. shall also form a part of the agreement.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 817
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
It is submitted that the intention is amply clear from Clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I., which states that the redressal of dispute between the
NBCC and the respondent shall only be through civil courts having
jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It further states that the laws applicable
to the contract between the parties shall be the laws enforceable in
India. It is submitted that merely on account of reference in the L.O.I.
to the terms and conditions as contained in the tender issued by the
DVC to the NBCC, Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms & Conditions
of Contract would not apply in view of specific modification as stated
in Clause 2.0 of the L.O.I.
6. Learned Senior Counsel submits that a mere reference to the
terms and conditions without there being an incorporation in the
L.O.I. would not make the lis between the parties amenable to the
arbitration proceedings. Relying on the judgment of this Court in
the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private Limited
vs. Som Datt Builders Limited1, he submits that unless the L.O.I.
specifically provides for incorporation of the arbitration clause, a
reference to the arbitration proceedings would not be permitted
in view of the provisions of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the
Arbitration Act.
7. Shri Sumit Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent,
on the contrary, submits that there is a specific reference in Clause
2.0 of the L.O.I. to the terms and conditions in the tender issued by
the DVC to the NBCC. He submits that the only modification is that
under Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms & Conditions of Contract,
the jurisdiction is vested with the Court in the City of Kolkata only,
whereas in the L.O.I. the jurisdiction would be vested in the civil
courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It is submitted that the
learned single judge of the Delhi High Court has rightly considered
this aspect and as such, no interference would be warranted in the
impugned order.
8. Sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act reads thus:
“7. Arbitration Agreement.-1)……………….
xxx xxx xxx
1 (2009) 7 SCC 696
818 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(5) The reference in a contract to a document containing
an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement
if the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to
make that arbitration clause part of the contract.”
9. The issue is no more res integra. The provisions of sub-section (5)
of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act have been considered by this
Court in the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private
Limited (supra). After considering the relevant passages from
Russell on Arbitration and various English judgments, this Court
held thus:
“24. The scope and intent of Section 7(5) of the Act may
therefore be summarised thus:
(i) An arbitration clause in another document, would
get incorporated into a contract by reference, if the
following conditions are fulfilled:
(1) the contract should contain a clear reference
to the documents containing arbitration clause,
(2) the reference to the other document should
clearly indicate an intention to incorporate the
arbitration clause into the contract,
(3) the arbitration clause should be appropriate, that
is capable of application in respect of disputes
under the contract and should not be repugnant
to any term of the contract.
(ii) When the parties enter into a contract, making a
general reference to another contract, such general
reference would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause from the referred document
into the contract between the parties. The arbitration
clause from another contract can be incorporated into
the contract (where such reference is made), only by
a specific reference to arbitration clause.
(iii) Where a contract between the parties provides that
the execution or performance of that contract shall
be in terms of another contract (which contains the
terms and conditions relating to performance and a
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 819
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
provision for settlement of disputes by arbitration),
then, the terms of the referred contract in regard
to execution/performance alone will apply, and not
the arbitration agreement in the referred contract,
unless there is special reference to the arbitration
clause also.
(iv) Where the contract provides that the standard form
of terms and conditions of an independent trade or
professional institution (as for example the standard
terms and conditions of a trade association or
architects association) will bind them or apply to the
contract, such standard form of terms and conditions
including any provision for arbitration in such
standard terms and conditions, shall be deemed to
be incorporated by reference. Sometimes the contract
may also say that the parties are familiar with those
terms and conditions or that the parties have read
and understood the said terms and conditions.
(v) Where the contract between the parties stipulates
that the conditions of contract of one of the parties
to the contract shall form a part of their contract (as
for example the general conditions of contract of
the Government where the Government is a party),
the arbitration clause forming part of such general
conditions of contract will apply to the contract
between the parties.”
10. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that when the parties
enter into a contract, making a general reference to another contract,
such general reference would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause from the referred document into the contract
between the parties. It has been held that the arbitration clause
from another contract can be incorporated into the contract (where
such reference is made), only by a specific reference to arbitration
clause. It has further been held that where a contract between the
parties provides that the execution or performance of that contract
shall be in terms of another contract (which contains the terms and
conditions relating to performance and a provision for settlement
of disputes by arbitration), then, the terms of the referred contract
820 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in regard to execution/performance alone will apply, and not the
arbitration agreement in the referred contract, unless there is special
reference to the arbitration clause also.
11. This Court further held that where the contract provides that the
standard form of terms and conditions of an independent trade or
professional institution will bind them or apply to the contract, such
standard form of terms and conditions including any provision for
arbitration in such standard terms and conditions, shall be deemed
to be incorporated by reference. It has been held that sometimes the
contract may also say that the parties are familiar with those terms
and conditions or that the parties have read and understood the said
terms and conditions. It has also been held that where the contract
between the parties stipulates that the conditions of contract of one
of the parties to the contract shall form a part of their contract, the
arbitration clause forming part of such general conditions of contract
will apply to the contract between the parties.
12. A perusal of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act itself
would reveal that it provides for a conscious acceptance of the
arbitration clause from another document, by the parties, as a part
of their contract, before such arbitration clause could be read as a
part of the contract between the parties.
13. It is thus clear that a reference to the document in the contract should
be such that shows the intention to incorporate the arbitration clause
contained in the document into the contract.
14. The law laid down in the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors
Private Limited (supra) has been followed by this Court in the
cases of Duro Felguera, S.A. vs Gangavaram Port Limited2
and Elite Engineering and Construction (Hyderabad) Private
Limited represented by its Managing Director vs Techtrans
Construction India Private Limited represented by its Managing
Director3.
15. No doubt that this Court in the case of Inox Wind Limited vs
Thermocables Limited4 has distinguished the law laid down in the
2 [2017] 10 SCR 285 : (2017) 9 SCC 729
3 [2018] 4 SCR 585 : (2018) 4 SCC 281
4 [2018] 1 SCR 86 : (2018) 2 SCC 519
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 821
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private Limited (supra).
In the said case (i.e. Inox Wind Limited), this Court has held that
though general reference to an earlier contract is not sufficient for
incorporation of an arbitration clause in the later contract, a general
reference to a standard form would be enough for incorporation of
the arbitration clause. Though this Court in the case of Inox Wind
Limited (supra) agrees with the judgment in the case of M.R.
Engineers and Contractors Private Limited (supra), it holds that
general reference to a standard form of contract of one party along
with those of trade associations and professional bodies will be
sufficient to incorporate the arbitration clause. In the said case (i.e.
Inox Wind Limited), this Court found that the purchase order was
issued by the appellant therein in which it was categorically mentioned
that the supply would be as per the terms mentioned therein and in
the attached standard terms and conditions. The respondent therein
by his letter had confirmed its acceptance. This Court found that the
case before it was a case of a single-contract and not two-contract
case and, therefore, held that the arbitration clause as mentioned
in the terms and conditions would be applicable.
16. The present case is a ‘two-contract’ case and not a ‘single-contract’
case.
17. It will be relevant to refer to Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms &
Conditions of Contract as contained in the tender issued by the DVC
to the NBCC. Clause 3.34 reads thus:
“3.34 SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES & ARBITRATION
Any dispute(s) or difference(s) arising out of or in connection
with the contract shall to the extent possible be settled
amicably between the owner and supplier/contractor.
In the event of any dispute or difference whatsoever arising
under the contract or in connection therewith including any
question relating to existence meaning and interpretation of
the contract or any alleged breach thereof the same shall
be referred to the sole arbitration of the Secretary, CEO
of Damodar Valley Corporation, Kolkata-54 or to a person
appointed by him for that purpose. The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of arbitration
and conciliation law 1996 and the decision/judgment of
Arbitrator shall be final and binding on both the parties.
822 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
All suits arising out of this enquiry and subsequent purchase
order, if any, are subject jurisdiction of court in the City of
Kolkata only and no other door when resolution/settlement
through mutual discussion and arbitration fails.”
18. No doubt that Clause 3.34 provides for a reference of the dispute
to the sole arbitration of the Secretary, CEO of Damodar Valley
Corporation, Kolkata-54 or to a person appointed by him for that
purpose.
19. It will also be apposite to refer to Clauses 1.0, 2.0, 7.0 and 10.0 of
the L.O.I., which read thus:
“1.0 The work shall be executed you on contractual,
financial and technical conditions of contract as
contained in the following documents which shall be
applicable and binding on you for execution of works
and shall form part of agreement with you as also
mentioned in the above mentioned NIT-01/WEIR/06
dated November 3, 2006.
(a) Notice Inviting Tender
(b) General Conditions of Contract
(c) Special Conditions of Contract
(d) Bill of Quantity
2.0 All terms and conditions as contained in the tender
issued by DVC to NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis
except where these have been expressly modified
by NBCC.
7.0 The redressal of dispute between NBCC and you
shall only be through civil courts having jurisdiction
of Delhi alone. The laws applicable to this contract
shall be the laws enforceable in India.
10.0 This letter of intent shall also form a part of the
agreement.
20. In view of Clause 1.0, the documents stated therein shall also form
part of the agreement. In view of Clause 2.0, all terms and conditions
as contained in the tender issued by the DVC to the NBCC shall apply
mutatis mutandis except where these have been expressly modified
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 823
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
by the NBCC. Clause 7.0 specifically provides that the redressal of
dispute between the NBCC and the respondent shall only be through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone. Clause 10.0 further
provides that the L.O.I. shall also form a part of the agreement.
21. It is thus clear that the intention between the parties is very clear.
Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I. which also forms part of the agreement
specifically provides that the redressal of the dispute between the
NBCC and the respondent shall only be through civil courts having
jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It is pertinent to note that Clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I. specifically uses the word “only” before the words “be
through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone”.
22. As already discussed herein above, when there is a reference in the
second contract to the terms and conditions of the first contract, the
arbitration clause would not ipso facto be applicable to the second
contract unless there is a specific mention/reference thereto.
23. We are of the considered view that the present case is not a case of
‘incorporation’ but a case of ‘reference’. As such, a general reference
would not have the effect of incorporating the arbitration clause.
In any case, Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I., which is also a part of the
agreement, makes it amply clear that the redressal of the dispute
between the NBCC and the respondent has to be only through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone.
24. In that view of the matter, we find that the learned single judge of
the Delhi High Court has erred in allowing the application of the
respondent. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The impugned
orders are quashed and set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
25. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

[Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and Aravind Kumar, JJ.]","Issue as regards the applicability of the relevant rule for imposition
of penalty. Whether it was the rule that existed when the violation
occurred during the license period of 2009-10 (rule 19 of Madhya
Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996, before the amendment) or
the rule 19 that was substituted by an amendment in 2011 when
proceedings for penalty were initiated.
","Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – Penalties
– Permissible limits of loss of liquor in transit due to leakage,
evaporation, wastage etc. – During the relevant license period
of 2009-2010 when the violation occurred, r.19 provided that
if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded, imposition of
penalty was to be about four times the maximum duty payable
on foreign liquor – However, no action was initiated against
the appellant during the relevant license period– r.19 was
substituted by an amendment in 2011 reducing penalty to an
amount not exceeding the duty payable on foreign liquor –
Demand notice issued in 2011 – Payment of penalty, if to be
as per the repealed r.19 or the substituted r.19:
Held: Penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis of
r.19 as substituted on 29.03.2011 – A repealed provision will cease
to operate from the date of repeal and the substituted provision
will commence to operate from the date of its substitution, subject
to specific statutory prescription – The operation of a subordinate
legislation is determined by the empowerment of the parent act –
The legislative authorization enabling the executive to make rules
prospectively or retrospectively is crucial – Without a statutory
empowerment, subordinate legislation will always commence to
operate only from the date of its issuance and at the same time,

of a repealed provision to rights and liabilities accrued during its
subsistence – Further, r.19 which was substituted on 29.03.2011 was
not notified to operate from any other date by the Government – If
the amendment by way of a substitution in 2011 was intended to
reduce the quantum of penalty for better administration and regulation
of foreign liquor, there is no justification to ignore the subject and
context of the amendment and permit the State to recover the
penalty as per the unamended Rule – Purpose of the amendment
was to achieve a proper balance between crime and punishment or
the offence and penalty – Classifying offenders into before or after
the amendment for imposing higher and lower penalties does not
serve any public interest – The substituted Rule alone will apply to
pending proceedings – Impugned order of the Division Bench of the
High Court set aside. [Paras 2.1, 13, 14, 17, 32, 35]

Violation occurred during the license period of 2009-10 – r.19

the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or

Rule for the transaction of 2009-2010 by virtue of specific
provisions under the 1957 Act:
Held: s.10 of the MP General Clauses Act by itself would not make any
difference as the Section is applicable only to enactments, i.e. when
any M.P. Act repeals any enactment and not a subordinate legislation
– Interpreting s.6, an identical provision of the General Clauses Act,
1897, this Court has consistently held that s.6 of the 1897 Act, has
no application to subordinate legislation – Further, the subject of
administration of liquor requires close monitoring and the amendment
must be seen in this context of bringing about good governance and
effective management – Seen in this context, the principle of s.10 of

1957 Act, relating continuation of a repealed provision to rights and
liabilities that accrued during the subsistence of the Rule does not
subserve the purpose and object of the amendment. [Paras 31, 32]
Administrative law – Subordinate legislation – Rule making
and its enforcement – Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules,
1996 – r.19:
Held: The process of identifying a crime and prescribing an
appropriate punishment is a complex and delicate subject that
the State has to handle while making rules and enforcing them
– The gravity of the offence, its impact on society and human
vulnerability are taken into account to provide the required
measure of deterrence and reform – Day to day working of the
Rules, reposing their effectiveness, ineffectiveness, deficiency of
deterrence, disproportionate penalty having a chilling effect on
genuine businesses, are some routine factors which require the
executive to make necessary amendments to the rules – In this
context, depending on the nature of offence, the proportionate
penalty is required to be modulated from time to time – In the present
case, the regulatory process required the Government to deal with
the problem of diversion and unlawful sale of foreign liquor and also
provide an appropriate penalty and punishment – In light of this, the
felt need of the State to amend and substitute r.19 which provided
a higher penalty at four times the duty, with a simple penalty not
exceeding the duty payable can be appreciated. [Para 31]
Madhya Pradesh General Clauses Act, 1957 – s.31 – Application
of Act to Ordinances and Regulations - “unless there is anything

of the 1957 Act were made applicable to the construction
of rules – By such application, the principle of a repeal of a
provision not affecting any liability incurred thereunder was
also extended to the operation of the subordinate legislations
under the Act – Therefore, the respondent-State submitted that
having incurred the liability of exceeding the prescribed limits
of losses of liquor for the license period 2009-10, the liability
is not affected by the subsequent substitution of r.19:
Held: Conscious of the big leap to extend the 1957 Act, for
construction of subordinate legislations, s.31 took care to provide
that it may be done only when it is not repugnant to the subject and
context – If the amendment of r.19 by way of a substitution in 2011
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 667
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
intended to reduce the quantum of penalty for better administration
and regulation of foreign liquor, there is no justification to ignore
the subject and context of the amendment and permit the State
to recover the penalty as per the unamended Rule. [Paras 23, 32]
Interpretation of Statutes – Interpretation statutes like the
General Clauses Act, 1897 - Purpose:
Held: Are enactments intended to set standards in construction of
statutes – The expression construction is of seminal importance
as it is oriented towards enabling a seeker of the text of a
statute to understand the true meaning of the words and their
intendment – Apart from setting coherent and consistent methods of
understanding enactments, the interpretation statutes also subserve
the purpose of reducing prolixity of legislations – Therefore, the
standard principles formulated in the interpretation statutes must
be read into any and every enactment falling for consideration –
Interpretation statutes or definitions in interpretation clauses are only
internal aids of construction of a statute – Subordinate legislation,
by its very nature, rests upon the executive’s understanding of
the primary legislation – When a Court is of the opinion that such
an understanding is not in consonance with the statute, it sets it
aside for being ultra-vires to the primary statute. [Paras 24, 27, 28]
Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – Retroactive
operation – Substituted Rule imposed lesser penalty than the
repealed rule if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded –
Plea of the respondent-State that the substituted Rule cannot
be given retrospective effect:
Held: Submission rejected – It is wrong to assume that the substituted
Rule is given retrospective effect if its benefits are made available
to pending proceedings or to those that have commenced after the
substitution – r.19 which was substituted on 29.03.2011 was made
applicable to proceedings that commenced with the issuance of the
demand notice in November, 2011 – The Rule operates retroactively
and thus saves it from arbitrarily classifying the offenders into two
categories with no purpose to subserve. [Para 33]
Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 –
Constitution of India – Article 20(1) – Substituted Rule imposed
lesser penalty than the repealed rule if permissible limits of loss
of liquor exceeded – Bar of Article 20(1) imposing a penalty
greater than the one in force at the time of the commission
of the offence, if applicable:
668 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Held: No – The substituted penalty only mollifies the rigour of the
law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to value of
the duty – Therefore, the bar of Article 20(1) of imposing a penalty
greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the
offence has no application – Single Judge was of the view that
the amendment by way of substitution had the effect of repealing
the law which existed as on the date of repeal – Division Bench
on the other hand, held that levy of penalty was substantive law,
and as such, it cannot operate retrospectively – Reasoning of
both, rejected. [Para 35]

Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.
1. Leave Granted.
2. The short question for our consideration is the applicability of the
relevant rule for imposition of penalty; whether it is the rule that
existed when the violation occurred during the license period of 2009-
10 or the rule that was substituted in 2011 when proceedings for
670 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
penalty were initiated. As the substituted rule reduced the quantum
of penalty, the appellant insists on its application but the statutory
authorities as well as the Division Bench of the High Court rejected
his case and imposed higher penalty under the old rule.
2.1 For the reasons to follow, we have accepted the contention
of the appellant and, in allowing the appeal, determined that
the purpose of the amendment is to achieve a proper balance
between crime and punishment or the offence and penalty.
In light of this, and recognizing that classifying offenders
into before or after the amendment for imposing higher and
lower penalties does not serve any public interest, we have
directed that the substituted Rule alone will apply to pending
proceedings.
3. Facts:- The appellant is a sub-licensee under the M.P. Excise Act,
19151 for manufacture, import and sale of Foreign Liquor, regulated
under the Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 19962.
3.1 Sub-licensees importing Foreign Liquor are granted transit
permits in which the origin, quality, quantity and point of delivery
of the imported liquor are recorded. At the point of destination, the
consignment is verified for quality and quantity, and a certificate
under Rule 13 is granted. Rule 16 prescribes the permissible
limits of loss of liquor in transit due to leakage, evaporation,
wastage etc. The purpose and object of this Rule is to prevent
illegal diversion of liquor for unlawful sale and also to prevent
evasion of excise duty. Relevant portion of Rule 16 is as follows:-
“Rule 16. Permissible limits of losses.-
(1) An allowance shall be made for the actual loss of spirit
by leakage, evaporation etc., and of bottled foreign
liquor by breakage caused by loading, unloading,
handling etc. in transit, at the rate mentioned
hereinafter. The total quantity of bottled foreign
liquor transported or exported shall be the basis for
computation of permissible losses.
1 Hereinafter referred to as “the Act”.
2 Hereinafter referred to as “the 1996 Rules”.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 671
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
(2) Wastage allowances on the spirit transported to
the premises of FL 9 or FL 9-A licensee shall be
the same as given in sub-rule (4) of Rule 6 of the
Distillery Rules, 1995.
(3) Maximum wastage allowance for all exports of bottled
foreign liquor shall be 0.25% irrespective of distance.
(4) Maximum wastage allowance for all transports of
bottled foreign liquor shall be 0.1% if the selling
licensee and the purchasing licensee belong to the
same district. It shall be 0.25% if they belong to
different districts.
(5) If wastages/losses during the export or transport of
bottled foreign liquor exceed the permissible limit
prescribed in sub-rule (3) or (4), the prescribed duty
on such excess wastage of bottled foreign liquor shall
be recovered from the licensee.”
3.2 If the permissible limits of loss of liquor are exceeded, the
1996 Rules prescribe imposition of penalty. Rule 19 providing
for penalty that could be imposed during the relevant license
period of 2009-2010 was about four times the maximum duty
payable on foreign liquor. The relevant portion of Rule 19 is
as follows: -
“Rule 19. Penalties3. –
(1) Without prejudice to the provisions of the Act, or
condition No. 4 of license in Form F.L. 1, condition
No. 7 of license in Form F.L 2, condition No. 4 of
license in Form F.L 3, the Excise Commissioner or
the Collector may impose a penalty not exceeding
Rs. 50,000 for contravention of any of these rules
or the provisions of the Act or any other rules made
under the Act or the order issued by the Excise
Commissioner.
(2) On all deficiencies in excess of the limits allowed
under Rule 16 and Rule 17, the F.L. 9 or FL 9-A,
3 Hereinafter “the old Rule”.
672 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
F.L. 10-A or F.L. 10-B licensee shall be liable to
pay penalty at a rate exceeding three times but not
exceeding four times the maximum duty payable on
foreign liquor at that time, as may be imposed by the
Excise Commissioner or any officer authorized by him:
Provided that if it be proved to the satisfaction of the
Excise Commissioner or the authorized officer that
such excess deficiency or loss was due to some
unavoidable cause, like fire or accident and its first
information report was lodged in Police Station, he
may waive the penalty imposable under this sub-rule.
(3) The Excise Commissioner or the Collector may
suspend or cancel the license under Section 31 of
the Act upon a contravention of any of these rules
or provisions of the Act, or any other rules made
under the Act, or the orders issued by the Excise
Commissioner.”
4. Facts reveal that no action was initiated during the license year of
2009-2010.
5. On 29.03.2011, Rule 19 was substituted by an amendment. The
relevant portion of substituted provision is as follows:
“Rule 19. Penalties4
(1) …
(2) On all deficiencies in excess of the limits allowed
under rule 16 and rule 17, the F.L.-9, F.L-9-A, F.L.-
10-B Licensee shall be liable to pay penalty at a
rate not exceeding the duty payable on foreign
liquor at that time, as may be imposed by the Excise
Commissioner or any officer authorized by him:
Provided that if it be proved to the satisfaction of the
Excise Commissioner or the authorized officer that
such excess deficiency or loss was due to some
unavoidable causes like fire or accident and its First
Information Report was lodged in concerned Police

Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
Station, he may waive the penalty imposable under
this sub-rule.”
(emphasis supplied)
6. As is evident, the above referred substituted Rule 19 reduces
penalty from four times the maximum duty payable to an amount
not exceeding the duty payable on foreign liquor.
7. Eight months after the amendment, a demand notice dated 22.11.2011
was issued directing payment of penalty for exceeding the permissible
limits during the license year 2009-2010. The notice demanded
penalty of four times the duty as per the old Rule 19. The appellant
replied, inter alia contending that penalty, if any, can only be under
the substituted Rule 19 as the old rule stood repealed, and in fact,
the demand is raised after the substituted Rule came into force.
8. The Deputy Commissioner5 rejected the objections raised by the
appellant and confirmed the demand for payment of penalty at four
times the duty payable. The Deputy Commissioner’s order was
upheld by the Excise Commissioner6, and thereafter by the Revenue
Board Gwalior7.
9. Questioning the decisions of the statutory authorities, the appellant
filed a writ petition before the High Court which was heard and
disposed of with 40 other petitions raising a similar issue. The
Single Judge of the High Court was of the view that the new Rule
was introduced by way of a substitution and following the principles
in State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal8, West U.P. Sugar Mills
Association v. State of U.P.9, Zile Singh, Government of India v. Indian
Tobacco Association10, he held that the old Rule stood repealed
from the statute book and only the substituted Rule applies to all
pending and future proceedings. He, therefore, set aside the orders
of the statutory authorities and remanded the matter back to them
for determining the penalty as per the substituted Rule.

Digital Supreme Court Reports
10. The Division Bench of the High Court, by the order impugned herein,
reversed the decision of the Single Judge on the simple ground that as
the license was granted for one year, the Rule that existed during that
license year must apply. The reason for not applying the substituted
Rule according to the Division Bench is also that determination of
penalty being substantive law, cannot operate retrospectively.
11. Questioning the legality and validity of the decision of the Division
Bench of the High Court, the present appeals are filed. Mr. Pratap
Venugopal, Ld. Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant
argued that the effect of substitution is to repeal the existing provision
from the statute book in its entirety and to enforce the newly substituted
provision. He would further submit that even for incidents which
took place when the old Rule was in force, it is the substituted Rule
that would be applicable, and therefore, the demand notice dated
22.11.2011 seeking payment of penalties under old Rule is illegal.
12. There is no difficulty in accepting the argument of Mr. Pratap
Venugopal on principle. In Koteswar Vittal Kamath v. K. Rangappa
Baliga & Co.11, this Court brought out the distinction between
supersession of a rule and substitution of a rule, and held that the
process of substitution consists of two steps – first, the old rule is
repealed, and next, a new rule is brought into existence in its place:
“8. On that analogy, it was argued that, if we hold that
the Prohibition Order of 1950, was invalid, the previous
Prohibition Order of 1119, cannot be held to be revived. This
argument ignores the distinction between supersession of
a rule, and substitution of a rule. In the case of Firm A.T.B.
Mehtab Majid & Co., the new Rule 16 was substituted for
the old Rule 16. The process of substitution consists of
two steps. First, the old rule it made to cease to exist and,
next, the new rule is brought into existence in its place.
Even if the new rule be invalid, the first step of the old
rule ceasing to exist comes into effect, and it was for this
reason that the court held that, on declaration of the new
rule as invalid, the old rule could not be held to be revived.”
11 [1969] 3 SCR 40 : (1969) 1 SCC 255
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 675
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
12.1 In Zile Singh v. State of Haryana12, this Court referred to the
legislative practice of an amendment by substitution and held
that substitution would have the effect of amending the operation
of law during the period in which it was in force.
“24. The substitution of one text for the other pre-existing
text is one of the known and well-recognised practices
employed in legislative drafting. “Substitution” has to be
distinguished from “supersession” or a mere repeal of an
existing provision.
25. Substitution of a provision results in repeal of the earlier
provision and its replacement by the new provision (see
Principles of Statutory Interpretation, ibid., p. 565). If any
authority is needed in support of the proposition, it is to
be found in West U.P. Sugar Mills Assn. v. State of U.P13.,
State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal14 , Koteswar Vittal
Kamath v. K. Rangappa Baliga and Co.15 and A.L.V.R.S.T.
Veerappa Chettiar v. I.S. Michael16 . In West U.P. Sugar Mills
Assn.17 case a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that
the State Government by substituting the new rule in place
of the old one never intended to keep alive the old rule.
Having regard to the totality of the circumstances centring
around the issue the Court held that the substitution had the
effect of just deleting the old rule and making the new rule
operative. In Mangilal Pindwal18 case this Court upheld the
legislative practice of an amendment by substitution being
incorporated in the text of a statute which had ceased to
exist and held that the substitution would have the effect
of amending the operation of law during the period in
which it was in force. In Koteswar case19 a three-Judge
Bench of this Court emphasised the distinction between

13 [2002] 1 SCR 897 : (2002) 2 SCC 645

Digital Supreme Court Reports
“supersession” of a rule and “substitution” of a rule and
held that the process of substitution consists of two steps:
first, the old rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the
new rule is brought into existence in its place.”
12.2 A slight variation is noticed in a recent decision in Gottumukkala
Venkata Krishamraju v. Union of India,20 where this Court held
that:
“18. Ordinarily wherever the word “substitute” or
“substitution” is used by the legislature, it has the effect
of deleting the old provision and make the new provision
operative. The process of substitution consists of two
steps : first, the old rule is made to cease to exist and,
next, the new rule is brought into existence in its place.
The rule is that when a subsequent Act amends an earlier
one in such a way as to incorporate itself, or a part of itself,
into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read
and construed as if the altered words had been written
into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words
scored out so that thereafter there is no need to refer to
the amending Act at all. No doubt, in certain situations,
the Court having regard to the purport and object sought
to be achieved by the legislature may construe the word
“substitution” as an “amendment” having a prospective
effect. Therefore, we do not think that it is a universal
rule that the word “substitution” necessarily or always
connotes two severable steps, that is to say, one of
repeal and another of a fresh enactment even if it implies
two steps. However, the aforesaid general meaning is to
be given effect to, unless it is found that the legislature
intended otherwise. Insofar as present case is concerned,
as discussed hereinafter, the legislative intent was also to
give effect to the amended provision even in respect of
those incumbents who were in service as on 1-9-2016.”
13. The operation of repeal or substitution of a statutory provision is
thus clear, a repealed provision will cease to operate from the date
20 [2018] 11 SCR 39 : (2019) 17 SCC 590
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 677
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
of repeal and the substituted provision will commence to operate
from the date of its substitution. This principle is subject to specific
statutory prescription. Statute can enable the repealed provision to
continue to apply to transactions that have commenced before the
repeal. Similarly, a substituted provision which operates prospectively,
if it affects vested rights, subject to statutory prescriptions, can also
operate retrospectively.
14. The principle governing subordinate legislation is slightly different in
as much as the operation of a subordinate legislation is determined
by the empowerment of the parent act. The legislative authorization
enabling the executive to make rules prospectively or retrospectively
is crucial. Without a statutory empowerment, subordinate legislation
will always commence to operate only from the date of its issuance
and at the same time, cease to exist from the date of its deletion or
withdrawal. The reason for this distinction is in the supremacy of the
Parliament and its control of executive action, being an important
subject of administrative law.
15. We will now refer to the rule making power under the M.P. Excise
Act, 1915. Section 62 of the Act empowers the State to make rules.
Relevant portion of Section 62 is as follows: –
“62. Power to make rules.— (1) The State Government
may make rules for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of this Act.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality
of the foregoing provision, the State Government may
make rules—
(a) prescribing the powers and duties of Excise Officers;
(b) to (n) …
(3) The power conferred by this section of making rules
is subject to the condition that the rules made under sub-
section (2) (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (i), (l) and (m) shall be
made after previous publication :
Provided that any such rules may be made without previous
publication if the State Government considers that they
should be brought into force at once.”
678 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
16. Section 62 does not enable the executive to continue the application of
a repealed rule to events that have commenced during the subsistence
of the Rule. However, Section 63 is of some importance. It enables
the executive to operate the Rule from a date as may be specified
in that behalf. Section 63 is reproduced as below:-
“63. Publication of rules and notifications.— All rules
made and notifications issued under this Act shall be
published in the Official Gazette, and shall have effect
from the date of such publication or from such other date
as may be specified in that behalf.”
17. It is clear that even Section 63 of the Act does not provide continuation
of a repealed provision to rights and liabilities accrued during its
subsistence. At the most, Section 63 of the M.P. Excise Act, 1915,
only enables the government to issue subordinate legislation with
effect from such a date as may be specified. We may mention
at this very stage that Rule 19 which has been substituted on
29.03.2011 has not been notified to operate from any other date
by the Government.
18. Faced with this situation, Mr. Saurabh Mishra, learned A.A.G. for the
State, came up with an attractive argument that the State of M.P. can
continue to apply the repealed Rule for the transaction of 2009-2010
by virtue of specific provisions under the Madhya Pradesh General
Clauses Act, 1957. He brought to our notice Section 10 of the Act
which is as follows:-
“10. Effect of Repeal. Where any Madhya Pradesh Act
repeals any enactment then, unless a different intention
appears, the repeal shall not-
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at
which the repeal takes effect; or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so
repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability, acquired,
accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; or
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in
respect of any offence committed against any enactment
so repealed; or
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 679
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy
in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid;
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy
may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as
if the repealing Madhya Pradesh Act had not been
passed.”
19. The above-referred Section of the MP General Clauses Act by
itself would not make any difference as the Section is applicable
only to enactments, i.e. when any M.P. Act repeals any enactment
and not a subordinate legislation. Interpreting an identical provision
of the General Clauses Act, 1897, i.e. Section 6, this Court has
consistently held that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897,
has no application to subordinate legislation.21
20. Mr. Saurabh Mishra then referred to Section 31 of Madhya Pradesh
General Clauses Act, 1957, which is as under:
“31. Application of Act to Ordinances and Regulations.-
The provisions of this Act shall apply, unless there is
anything repugnant in the subject or context-
(a) to any Ordinance or Regulation as they apply in relation
to Madhya Pradesh Acts:
Provided that sub-section (1) of section 3 of this Act shall
apply to any Ordinance or Regulation as if for the reference
in the said sub-section (1) to the day of the first publication
of the assent to an Act in the Official Gazette there were
substituted a reference to the day of the first publication
of the Ordinance or the Regulation, as the case may be,
in that Gazette;

Digital Supreme Court Reports
21. By virtue of Section 31, the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh
General Clauses Act, 1957 are made applicable to the construction
of rules. By such application, the principle of a repeal of a provision
not affecting any liability incurred thereunder is also extended to
the operation of the subordinate legislations under the Act. It is,
therefore, submitted that having incurred the liability of exceeding
the prescribed limits of losses of liquor for the license period 2009-
10, the liability is not affected by the subsequent substitution of
Rule 19.
22. This submission was not raised before the Single Judge or the
Division Bench. However, as law operates irrespective of the choices
of parties or their counsels in raising and referring to it in a court of
law, we have permitted him to argue this question of law. We will
now examine the application of Section 31 and its operation.
23. Section 31 of the M.P. General Clauses Act, 1957, relating to
extension of its provisions to subordinate legislation is thus, distinct
and more ambitious than that of its big sister, the General Clauses
Act, 1897, the Central Legislation which extends its provisions to
Ordinances and Regulations which are in the nature of legislation.22
Conscious of the big leap to extend the M.P. General Clauses Act,
1957, for construction of subordinate legislations, Section 31 takes
care to provide that it may be done only when it is not repugnant to
the subject and context. In its own words – unless there is anything
g repugnant in the subject and context.
24. Interpretation statutes such as the General Clauses Act, 1897, are
enactments intended to set standards in construction of statutes. The
expression construction is of seminal importance as it is oriented
towards enabling a seeker of the text of a statute to understand the
true meaning of the words and their intendment. Apart from setting
coherent and consistent methods of understanding enactments,
the interpretation statutes also subserve the purpose of reducing
prolixity of legislations. The standard principles formulated in the
interpretation statutes must, therefore, be read into any and every
enactment falling for consideration.
22 Thus, this Court has held in a number of cases that the General Clauses Act, 1897 is only applicable to
statutes.

The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
25. In Pushpa Devi v. Milkhi Ram23 while explaining the purpose and object
of prefacing a definition or an interpretation with the phrase- “unless
there is anything repugnant in the subject or context”- this court held :-
“19. The opening sentence in the definition of the section
states “unless there is anything repugnant in the subject
or context”. In view of this qualification, the court has not
only to look at the words but also to examine the context
and collocation in the light of the object of the Act and the
purpose for which a particular provision was made by the
legislature. Reference may be made to the observations of
Wanchoo, J. in Vanguard Fire and General Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. M/s Fraser and Ross [(1960) 3 SCR 857, 863: AIR
1960 SC 971: (1960) 30 Com Cas 13] where the learned
Judge said that even where the definition is exhaustive
inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain
thing, it is possible for the word to have a somewhat different
meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon
the subject or context…
20. Great artistry on the bench as elsewhere is, therefore,
needed before we accept, reject or modify any theory
or principle. Law as creative response should be so
interpreted to meet the different fact situations coming
before the court. For, Acts of Parliament were not drafted
with divine prescience and perfect clarity. It is not possible
for the legislators to foresee the manifold sets of facts
and controversies which may arise while giving effect to
a particular provision. Indeed, the legislators do not deal
with the specific controversies. When conflicting interests
arise or defect appears from the language of the statute,
the court by consideration of the legislative intent must
supplement the written word with ‘force and life’. See, the
observation of Lord Denning in Seaford Court Estate Ltd.
v. Asher [(1949) 2 KB 481, 498].”
26. In Vanguard Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Fraser and
Ross24 this Court held that:
23 [1990] 1 SCR 278 : (1990) 2 SCC 134
24 [1960] 3 SCR 857 : (1960) 3 SCR 857
682 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“6. …That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin
with the qualifying words similar to the words used in the
present case, namely, unless there is anything repugnant
in the subject or context. Therefore in finding out the
meaning of the word ‘insurer’ in various sections of the
Act, the meaning to be ordinarily given to it is that given
in the definition clause. But this is not inflexible and there
may be sections in the Act where the meaning may have
to be departed from on account of the subject or context
in which the word has been used and that will be giving
effect to the opening sentence in the definition section,
namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject
or context. In view of this qualification, the court has not
only to look at the words but also to look at the context, the
collocation and the object of such words relating to such
matter and interpret the meaning intended to be conveyed
by the use of the words under the circumstances…”
27. In the ultimate analysis, interpretation statutes or definitions in
interpretation clauses are only internal aids of construction of a
statute. Who do they aid? Interpretation is the exclusive domain of
the Court.25 A Constitutional Court is tasked with the sacred duty of
interpreting the Constitution, Acts of Parliament or States, subordinate
legislations, regulations, instructions and even to practices having
force of law. Whichever or wherever the instrument, interpretation
is the exclusive province of the Court.26 The principle is aptly
enunciated as:
“The Court has the function of authoritatively construing
legislation, that is, determining its legal meaning so far as
is necessary to decide a case before it. This function is
exclusive to the Court, and a meaning found by any other
person, for example an authorising agency, an investigating
agency, an executing agency, a prosecuting agency, or
even the legislature itself, except when intending to declare
or amend the law, is always subject to the determination
of the court.
25 Keshavji Ravji & Co. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, [1990] 1 SCR 243 : (1990) 2 SCC 231
26 Dr. Major Meeta Sahai v. State of Bihar [2019] 15 SCR 273 : (2019) 20 SCC 17
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 683
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
It is usually said that the making of law, as opposed to
its interpretation, is a matter for the legislature, and not
for the courts, but, in so far as that legislature does not
convey its intention clearly, expressly and completely,
it is taken to require the court to spell out that intention
where necessary. This may be done either by finding and
declaring implications in the words used by the legislator, or
by regarding the breadth or other obscurity of the express
language as conferring a delegated legislative power to
elaborate its meaning in accordance with public policy
(including legal policy) and the purpose of the legislation.
Whichever course is adopted, in accordance with the
doctrine of precedent the court’s operation influences the
future legal meaning of the enactment by producing what
may be called sub-rules, which are implied or expressed
in the court’s judgment.”27
28. Subordinate legislation, by its very nature, rests upon the executive’s
understanding of the primary legislation. When a Court is of the
opinion that such an understanding is not in consonance with the
statute, it sets it aside for being ultra-vires to the primary statute.
29. We will now examine if there is anything repugnant to the subject
or context to disapply the mandate of Section 31 of M.P. General
Clauses Act, 1957, to the construction of the 1996 Rules. If the
subject and context guide us in coming to that conclusion, we will
not extend the effect of repeal in Section 10 of the MP General
Clauses Act, 1957 to the repealed Rule 19. On the other hand, if
the subject and context have no bearing on the construction of the
Rule, then we will give effect to Section 10 and apply the repealed
Rule to the liability incurred by the appellant during the license year
2009-10 and allow the imposition of four times the duty as penalty.
30. The 1996 Rules regulate the grant of license for manufacture and
bottling of foreign liquor, procurement of spirit, storage, quality and
control, sale, export, verification etc. Rule 19 provides for penalties
for contravention of any of the Rules or provision of the Act. There
are different penalties for violation of different rules.
27 Halsbury’s Laws, (5th edn, 2018), vol 96, para 694
684 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
31. The regulatory process requires the Government to deal with the
problem of diversion and unlawful sale of foreign liquor and also
provide an appropriate penalty and punishment. The process of
identifying a crime and prescribing an appropriate punishment is
a complex and delicate subject that the State has to handle while
making rules and enforcing them. The gravity of the offence, its
impact on society and human vulnerability are taken into account to
provide the required measure of deterrence and reform. Day to day
working of the Rules, reposing their effectiveness, ineffectiveness,
deficiency of deterrence, disproportionate penalty having a chilling
effect on genuine businesses, are some routine factors which require
the executive to make necessary amendments to the rules. In this
context, depending on the nature of offence, the proportionate penalty
is required to be modulated from time to time. In light of this, we can
appreciate that the felt need of the State to amend and substitute
Rule 19 which provided a higher penalty at four times the duty, with
a simple penalty not exceeding the duty payable.
32. If the amendment by way of a substitution in 2011 is intended to reduce
the quantum of penalty for better administration and regulation of
foreign liquor, there is no justification to ignore the subject and context
of the amendment and permit the State to recover the penalty as per
the unamended Rule. The subject of administration of liquor requires
close monitoring and the amendment must be seen in this context of
bringing about good governance and effective management. Seen
in this context, the principle of Section 10 of MP General Clauses
Act, 1957, relating continuation of a repealed provision to rights and
liabilities that accrued during the subsistence of the Rule does not
subserve the purpose and object of the amendment.
33. It is also submitted on behalf of the State that the substituted Rule
cannot be given retrospective effect. We are not in agreement with
this submission either. It is wrong to assume that the substituted
Rule is given retrospective effect if its benefits are made available
to pending proceedings or to those that have commenced after the
substitution. Rule 19 which was substituted on 29.03.2011 is made
applicable to proceedings that have commenced with the issuance of
the demand notice in November, 2011. The Rule operates retroactively
and thus saves it from arbitrarily classifying the offenders into two
categories with no purpose to subserve.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 685
Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v.
The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.
34. The single Judge as well as the Division Bench have adopted two
different approaches and we have not agreed with either of them.
The single Judge was of the view that the amendment by way of
substitution has the effect of repealing the law which existed as
on the date of repeal. We have already explained the limitation
in this approach. The Division Bench on the other hand, held that
levy of penalty is substantive law, and as such, it cannot operate
retrospectively. This again is a wrong approach. The substituted
penalty only mollifies the rigour of the law by reducing the penalty
from four times the duty to value of the duty. Therefore, the bar of
Article 20(1)28 of imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at
the time of the commission of the offence has no application. While
rejecting the reasoning of the single Judge as well as the Division
Bench, we seek to underscore the importance of a simple and plain
understanding of laws and its processes, keeping in mind the purpose
and object for which they seek to govern and regulate us.
35. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeals and set aside
the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Appeals
Nos. 425/2016, 6/2017, 7/2017, 8/2017, 9/2017, 10/2017, 11/2017,

41/2017, 42/2017 and 100/2017 dated 29.06.2017. We further hold
that the penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis
of Rule 19 as substituted on 29.03.2011. There shall be no order
as to costs.

","Judgment
Aniruddha Bose, J.
The two appeals (i.e. Civil Appeal Nos.2745 and 2754 of 2023) arise
out of a judgment delivered by a learned Single Judge of the High
Court of Bombay on 25.07.2019 directing, inter alia, wage revisions
pertaining to the workmen of VVF India Limited (“the employer”)
working in two units at Sewree and Sion. Civil Appeal No.2744 of
2023 has been instituted by the employees union (“the union”) against
a judgment of the High Court delivered on 22.06.2021 dismissing the
union’s petition for review of the judgment passed on 25.07.2019.
Argument of the union in the review petition was that their submissions
relating to certain allowances were not considered in the main
judgment. The employer is the appellant in Civil Appeal No.2754 of
2023 and the union is the appellant in Civil Appeal No.2744 of 2023
as also Civil Appeal No.2745 of 2023.
2. The present proceedings have their origin in a charter of demand
raised by the union on 04.03.2008. The demand was in respect
of altogether 146 workmen, out of which 80 were engaged at the
employer’s establishment at Sewree and 66 of them employed at
Sion, both being situated within Mumbai. We find from the judgment
delivered on 24.07.2019 (which we shall henceforth refer to as the
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 579
The VVF Ltd. Employees Union v. M/S. VVF India Limited & Anr.
judgment under appeal) that the original corporate entity VVF Ltd.,
underwent a demerger process and the units of the company at Sion
and Taloja went to VVF India Ltd., the resulting company, during
pendency of the reference, arising from the charter of demand.
3. The demands of the Union would appear from the charter of demand
and they primarily relate to prayers for revision in pay scale/wages/
salaries along with certain allowances such as leave facilities and
gratuity. The charter of demand for the year 2008 to 2011 were under
the following heads:-
“The Charter of Demand for the corresponding year 2008
to 2011 is as follows-

publication of this award by the appropriate Authority.
v) The First Party Company is at liberty to adjust the
interim amount paid to the concerned employees
from their arrears.
vi) In the circumstances, no order as to cost.”
5. Both the employer and the union challenged the said award by
instituting separate writ petitions before the High Court of Bombay
and these writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment
by a learned Single Judge of the High Court, being the judgment
under appeal before us. The Union’s writ petition was registered
as Writ Petition No. 1920 of 2014 whereas the writ petition of the
company was registered as Writ Petition No.3152 of 2014. The High
Court allowed the workmen’s writ petition by setting aside the award
of the Tribunal so far as the first four demands as per the charter
are concerned and upheld the Tribunal’s verdict regarding Demand
No. 5-11. The particulars thereof would appear from the following
passages of the judgment: -

The VVF Ltd. Employees Union v. M/S. VVF India Limited & Anr.
The following adjustments are proposed so as to rationalize
the transition from the present basic wage structure to the
revised scale proposed as above:
A. The present basic of employees I staff as in annexure
I & II should brought up to the level of minimum of
wage scales wherever they are below.
B. Those whose present wages of basic do not fit in any
stages of their respective revised wage scales and
fall in between two stages, they should be stepped
up to earnest highest stages in the scales.
C. On doing so (a) and (b) above every employee /
staff should be granted additional increment in their
respective wage scales as indicated below:-
i) Those who have put service up to 5 years -1
increment
ii) Those who have put service more than -2
5 years but less than 10 years increment
iii) Those who have put service more than -3
10 years but less than 15 years increment
(iv) Those who have put service more than -4
15 years but less than 20 years increment
(v) Those who have put service more than -5
20 years but less than 25 years increment
vi) Those who have put service more than 25 -6”
years increment
""29. To arrive at the proposed revision, the existing
fixed dearness allowance of Rs.225/- for daily
rated unskilled (USK), Semi skilled (SSK) and
skilled workmen (SK) as also monthly rated Highly
Skilled workmen (HSK), 1st class boiler attendants,
watchmen, head watchman, drivers, peons (i.e. all
employees other than supervisors and officers) can
be appropriately raised by Rs.1000/- per month so
as to make it Rs.1225/- per month. Fixed dearness
allowance for monthly rated junior supervisors,
supervisors and senior supervisors and officers
586 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
may not be increased. So far as variable dearness
allowance is concerned, no increase may be in order
till 2011. Increase, if any, deserves to be considered
from 2011 onwards, which demand, anyway, is the
subject matter of a separate reference (for the period
2011-2014).”
So far as the employer’s writ petition is concerned the same was
dismissed. The High Court held that there was no serious anomaly
in the demands of the union allowed by the Tribunal.
6. The union, in its writ petition, argued that the Tribunal had failed to
consider the plea of the workmen for parity with similarly situated
units in the vicinity as well as its claim for overtime allowances. The
test applied by the High Court as regards comparison with the similar
units would appear from paragraph 26 of the impugned judgment,
which reads:-
“26 In Justification, what was submitted was that this,
along with the applicable allowances (as revised), would
bring the Mumbai workmen on par with their counterparts
in the Taloja unit. To assess this submission, I called upon
both parties to submit their respective charts of Mumbai
and Taloja salaries for all classes of workers and the
impact of revision in pay scales proposed by the union.
According to the union, the revision proposed would bring
up the salaries of skilled grade workmen having 15 years
of service (taken as a representative case) to Rs.16,250/-
per month as against the salaries of Rs.16,248/- of their
Taloja counterparts (as of October 2010). (Comparative
chart of Godrej Industries, Deepak Fertilizers and Hikal
Ltd. shows their comparable salaries, as of October 2010,
of Rs.28,621/-, Rs.20,492/- and Rs.21,419/- respectively.)
The monthly and annual burdens on the Respondent
employer occasioned by the increase work out to between
Rs.6.58 lacs to Rs.14.01 lacs per month, and Rs.78.94
lacs to Rs.1.68 crores, for the particular wage fixation
period, namely, from 2008 to 2011.”
7. The employer has assailed the judgment questioning the jurisdiction
of the Writ Court in entering into fact-finding exercise while testing
legality of an award. The employer’s case argued by Mr. Cama,
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 587
The VVF Ltd. Employees Union v. M/S. VVF India Limited & Anr.
learned Senior Advocate, sought to fault the approach of the High
Court mainly on this ground. He has also argued that the units
with which the High Court had made comparison to arrive at its
finding were not similarly situated, having regard to their industrial
output and financial position. He submits further that the High Court
in any event would not sit in appeal over the Tribunal’s award in
exercising its jurisdiction of judicial review, primarily applying the
scope of the writ of certiorari. He has relied on judgments of this
Court in the cases of Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai and
Others [(2003) 6 SCC 675], General Management, Electrical
Rengali Hydro Electric Project, Orrisa and Others -vs- Giridhari
Sahu and Others [(2019) 10 SCC 695]. In the former judgment,
it has been held:-
“12. In the exercise of certiorari jurisdiction, the High
Court proceeds on an assumption that a court which has
jurisdiction over a subject-matter has the jurisdiction to
decide wrongly as well as rightly. The High Court would
not, therefore, for the purpose of certiorari assign to itself
the role of an appellate court and step into reappreciating
or evaluating the evidence and substitute its own findings
in place of those arrived at by the inferior court.”
Broadly the same principle has been laid down in the case of
Giridhari Sahu (supra). Mr. Cama has also submitted that in the
event the High Court found flaw in the reasoning of the Tribunal on
factual basis, instead of undertaking the exercise of revision of pay
scale and wages as also other facilities itself in substituting its view
in place of the Tribunal’s, the High Court ought to have remanded
the matter to the Tribunal itself.
8. The union was represented by Mr. Sanjay Singhvi, learned
senior counsel. His submission is that it would be well within the
jurisdiction of the High Court to undertake some form of exercise
of appreciation of facts and on judgments he has relied on the
judgment of this Court in the cases of M/S Unichem Laboratories
Ltd. -vs- Workmen [(1972) 3 SCC 552], Workmen -vs- New
Egerton Woollen Mills [(1969) 2 LLJ 782], Shail (SMT) -vs-
Manoj Kumar and Others [(2004) 4 SCC 785], IEL Supervisors’
Association and Others -vs- Duncans Industries Ltd. and
Another [(2018) 4 SCC 505].
588 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
9. Relying on this line of authorities, and also a judgment of this Court
in the case of Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. and Others -vs- Gujarat
Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha and Others [(1980) 2 SCC 593], he
has argued that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226
of the Constitution of India is wide enough and can decide factual
issues instead of remanding a matter. In the latter authority, it was
held, inter-alia, that in appropriate cases, the High Court’s jurisdiction
could be coordinate to that of the Tribunal.
10. On behalf of both the parties, a large body of authorities has been
relied upon but in this judgment, we shall deal with those decisions
only which we find relevant for effective adjudication of the present
appeal.
11. As we have already indicated, the main question which has been
argued by the learned counsel appearing for the employer is on the
issue as to whether the High Court had travelled beyond its jurisdiction
in appreciating facts and in that process substituted the finding of
the Tribunal with its own finding on facts. To substantiate the point,
as we have already discussed, the cases of Giridhari (supra) and
Surya Dev Rai (supra) have been relied on by Mr. Cama.
12. There are authorities, to which we have referred to earlier in this
judgment that lay down the scope of jurisdiction of the High Court.
In the cases of Unichem Laboratories Ltd. (supra), Shail (SMT)
(supra), IEL Supervisors’ Assn. (supra) as also the case of Gujarat
Steel Tubes Ltd. (supra), it has been held that the High Court in
appropriate cases can go into facts while examining an award of a
Tribunal.
13. For revision of wages and other facilities, the standard criteria which
is followed by the industrial adjudicator is to apply industry-cum-
region test, which in substance implies that the prevailing pay and
other allowances should be compared with equally placed or similarly
situated industrial units in the same region. To determine comparability
of units applying the industry-cum-region test, inter alia, the financial
capacity of the employer would be a strong factor. Reliance on this
point has been placed on the cases of French Motor Car Co. Ltd.
-vs- Workmen [(1962) 2 LLJ 744], The Silk and Art Silk Mills
Association Ltd. -vs- Mill Mazdoor Sabha [(1972) 2 SCC 253]
and Shivraj Fine Arts Litho Works -vs- State Industrial Court,
Nagpur & Ors. [(1978) 2 SCC 601].
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 589
The VVF Ltd. Employees Union v. M/S. VVF India Limited & Anr.
14. Substantial argument of Mr. Cama was on selection of comparable
units. His submission is that the High erred in identifying the matching
units and also calling for fresh charts in course of hearing of the writ
petition with respect to Taloja unit of the original employer. It is the
stand of the employer that such evidence gathering exercise ought not
to have been undertaken by the High Court. It was also pointed out
on behalf of the employer that it was making losses barring in three
financial years between 2008-09 and 2021-22. Further submission
of Mr. Cama is that the workmen of the Taloja unit were not of the
same employer after the demerger had taken place and that they
were involved in a separate set of activities when compared to the
other units in question.
15. Analysis of the authorities relied on by the learned counsel for parties
reflect the position of law on this point to be that, though the High
Court ought not to reappreciate evidence and substitute its own finding
for that of the Tribunal, it would not be beyond the jurisdiction of the
High Court in its power of judicial review to altogether eschew such
a process. The High Court, in the impugned judgment, however,
reappreciated the evidence led before the Tribunal in identifying
comparable concerns for applying the industry-cum-region test. In
particular, the employer has emphasised that the High Court ignored
the negative financial status of the company on the ground that the
losses made by it was miniscule. In this regard, the judgments of
this Court in the case of A.K. Bindal -vs- Union of India & Ors.
[(2003) 5 SCC 163] Mukand Ltd. -vs- Mukand Staff & Officers
Association [(2004) 10 SCC 460] have been relied upon. Both
these authorities lay down the financial capacity of an employer is an
important factor which could not be ignored in fixing wage structure.
In the given facts where the employer seriously contested the use of
the concerned units as comparable ones, and highlighted its difficult
financial position, the proper course would have been to remit the
matter to the Industrial Tribunal rather than entering into these
factual question independently in exercise of the writ jurisdiction.
This exercise would have required leading of evidence before the
primary forum, the Industrial Tribunal in this case.
16. On behalf of the employer, it was also specifically argued that various
allowances like house rent, shift allowance, travelling, medical,
education and leave travel were granted without any evidence. The
employer’s witness no.2 had given his deposition in detail, particularly
590 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
on financial position of the company. From the judgment impugned,
we do not find proper analysis of the employer’s evidence in that
regard. So far as the union’s appeal is concerned, their point is
confined to treatment of overtime wages in computing allowances
admissible to them. That question also ought to be re-examined.
17. We, accordingly, set aside the judgment of the High Court delivered on
25.07.2019 as also the Tribunal’s award. Let the Tribunal re-examine
the cases of the respective parties afresh. We are conscious of the
fact that these proceedings arise from a charter of demand made
in 2008. We direct the Tribunal to conclude the reference within a
period of six months. The Civil Appeal No.2744 of 2023 against the
review order dated 22.06.2021 also stands disposed of.
18. Thus, all the three appeals stand disposed of in the above terms.
19. There shall be no order as to costs.
20. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

(Civil Appeal No. 2878 of 2024)
22 February 2024
[B.V. Nagarathna* and Ujjal Bhuyan, JJ.]","1) Whether statutory vesting of property termed as enemy
property under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act,
1968 amounts to expropriation which leads to change of its
status inasmuch as its ownership is transferred to the Union
of India;
2) If there is a transfer of ownership by its statutory vesting
in the Custodian for Enemy Property, whether the Union
within the meaning of Article 285 of the Constitution would
be entitled to exemption from payment of property or other
local taxes to Municipal Corporation under provisions of
the UP Municipal Corporation Adhiniyam, 1959 (Act of
1959); and
3) Despite becoming the property of the Union, whether, clause
(2) of Article 285 enables the appellant to impose property or
other local taxes on the respondent, which is lessee of the
subject enemy property.
","Enemy Property Act, 1968 – Whether statutory vesting
of enemy property including the subject property in the
Custodian for Enemy Property amounts to expropriation
and transfer of ownership so as to confer ownership of such
enemy property on the Custodian – Enemy Property Rules,
2015 – r.15.
Held: The Custodian for Enemy Property in India, in whom the
enemy properties vest including the subject property, does not
acquire ownership of the said properties – The enemy properties
vest in the Custodian as a trustee only for the management and
* Author

Digital Supreme Court Reports
administration of such properties – The Central Government may,
on a reference or complaint or on its own motion initiate a process
of divestment of enemy property vested in the Custodian to the
owner thereof or to such other person vide Rule 15 of the Rules
– Hence, the vesting of the enemy property in the Custodian is
only as a temporary measure and he acts as a trustee of the said
properties – In view of the position of a Custodian, who under
the Enemy Property Act, 1968, acts as the trustee for the enemy
property under the Act and not as the owner of the property, but
as a protector of the property vested in him, the Custodian can
never be an owner or having any right, title or interest in the enemy
property as owner.[Paras 16.1, 22.4]
Taxation – Of Enemy property – Constitution of India – Art.
285 – If ownership of enemy property is conferred on the
Custodian for Enemy Property, whether such property
becomes Union property within meaning of Art. 285 of
the Constitution and therefore, it is exempt from payment
of property or other local taxes to appellant-Municipal
Corporation under provisions of the Act of 1959 – Whether
despite such enemy property becoming property of the
Union, clause (2) of Article 285 of the Constitution enables
appellant to impose property or other local taxes on the
respondent which is lessee of the subject property – Enemy
Property Act, 1968 – UP Municipal Corporation Adhiniyam,
1959.
Held: Vesting of enemy property in the Custodian does not
transfer ownership of such property in the Custodian and by
that process in the Union or Central Government, but since the
Custodian is only a trustee of the enemy property, the same is
liable to tax in accordance with law, including to the appellant
– The Custodian is only authorised to pay the taxes on the
subject enemy property – The Custodian while doing so is not
acting on behalf of the Union Government being the owner of
the enemy property, rather, the Custodian who is appointed by
the Central Government under the provisions of the Act, which
is a Central legislation only discharges his duties and functions
under the provisions of the Parliamentary legislation i.e. the Act
under consideration – Such discharge of duties and functions,
including the payment of taxes vis-à-vis enemy property vested
in him would not also by the same logic imply that the Custodian
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 849
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
is acting as if the property vested in him has become the Union
property – Mere vesting of enemy property in the Custodian
does not transfer ownership of the same from the enemy to the
Union or to the Central Government; the ownership remains with
the enemy but the Custodian only protects and manages the
enemy property and in discharging his duties as the Custodian
or the protector of enemy property he acts in accordance with
the provision of the Act and on the instructions or guidance of
the Central Government – The reason as to why the Central
Government is empowered to issue guidelines or instructions to
the Custodian is because the Custodian is appointed under the
Act which is a Parliamentary legislation and the reason why the
Parliament has passed the said law is in order to have a uniformity
vis-à-vis all enemy properties throughout the length and breadth
of the country in that the same are protected, managed and dealt
with uniformly in accordance with the provisions of the Act – Union
of India cannot assume ownership of the enemy properties once
the said property is vested in the Custodian – This is because,
there is no transfer of ownership from the owner of the enemy
property to the Custodian and consequently, there is no ownership
rights transferred to the Union of India – Therefore, the enemy
properties which vest in the Custodian are not Union properties
– As the enemy properties are not Union properties, clause (1)
of Article 285 does not apply to enemy properties – Clause (2)
of Article 285 is an exception to clause (1) and would apply only
if the enemy properties are Union properties and not otherwise
– High Court was not right in holding that the respondent as
occupier of the subject enemy property, is not liable to pay any
property tax or other local taxes to the appellant – Consequently,
any demand for payment of taxes under the Act of 1959 made
and thereby paid by the respondent to the appellant-authority
shall not be refunded – However, if no demand notices have
been issued till date, the same shall not be issued but from the
current fiscal year onwards (2024-2025), the appellant shall be
entitled to levy and collect the property tax as well as water tax
and sewerage charges and any other local taxes in accordance
with law. [Paras 17.9, 22.4]
Constitution of India – Art.300A – Art. 300A states that no
person shall be deprived of his property save by authority
of law – Expressions “law”, “person”, “property” and “by
authority of law” – Meaning of – Whether having regard to
850 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Art. 300A, taking possession of the enemy property for the
purpose of administration of the same by the Custodian, is
an instance of transfer of ownership from the true owner to
the Custodian and thereby to the Union – Enemy Property
Act, 1968.
Held: The word “law” is with reference to an Act of Parliament or
of a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having the force
of law – Although, to hold property is not a fundamental right, yet
it is a constitutional right – The expression person in Article 300-A
covers not only a legal or juristic person but also a person who is
not a citizen of India – The expression property is also of a wide
scope and includes not only tangible or intangible property but also
all rights, title and interest in a property – Before a person can
be deprived of his right to property, the law must expressly and
explicitly state so – Thus, the expression by authority of law means
by or under a law made by the competent Legislature – Having
regard to the salutary principles of Art. 300-A, one cannot construe
the taking of possession of the enemy property for the purpose
of administration of the same by the Custodian, as an instance of
transfer of ownership from the true owner to the Custodian and
thereby to the Union – This position is totally unlike the position
under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the
subsequent legislation of 2013 which are expropriatory legislations
under which acquisition of land would inevitably result in transfer
of the ownership of the land from the owner to the State which is
the acquiring authority, but the same would be subject to payment
of a reasonable and fair compensation to the owner. [Paras 18
and 18.2]
Words and Phrases – Expression “vest” and “vesting” –
Meaning of.
Held: The expression ‘vest’ or ‘vesting’ has no precise definition
and it would depend upon the context in which the expression is
used under a particular enactment – The word ‘vesting’ is a word
of variable input and has more than one meaning which must be
discerned and the exact connotation must be found by looking
into the scheme of law and the context in which it is used – The
setting in which it is used would lend colour to it and divulge the
legislative intent – Vesting of property in a person or authority does
not always mean transfer of absolute title in the property. [Para 16]

2. The present Civil Appeal has been filed by the Lucknow Nagar
Nigam (‘Municipal Corporation’) impugning the judgment of the
High Court of Allahabad that has allowed the Writ Petition filed by
respondent herein (‘the assessee’), thereby holding that the assessee
is exempt from payment of property tax under the provisions of the
UP Municipal Corporation Adhiniyam, 1959 (hereinafter referred to
as “Act of 1959”, for brevity sake).
Bird’s Eye View of the Controversy:
3. Whether statutory vesting of property termed as enemy property
under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act, 1968 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Act” for the sake of convenience) amounts to
expropriation which leads to the change of its status inasmuch as its
ownership is transferred to the Union of India, is a question that has
arisen in the present appeal. If there is a transfer of ownership by its
statutory vesting in the Custodian for Enemy Property, whether the
Union within the meaning of Article 285 of the Constitution of India
would be entitled to exemption from payment of property or other
local taxes to Municipal Corporation under the provision of the Act
of 1959 is another question that has arisen in the present appeal.
Further, despite becoming the property of the Union, whether, clause
(2) of Article 285 enables the appellant herein to impose property
or other local taxes on the respondent, which is the lessee of the
subject property is the third question which arises in this appeal.
Relevant Facts of the Case:
4. The subject property is an Enemy Property within the meaning of
the Act bearing House No.31/28/04(31/59) located on Mahatma
Gandhi Marg, Lucknow, owned by the Raja of Mahmudabad, who
migrated to Pakistan in the year 1947. A portion of the property is
currently occupied and utilized for profit-generating purposes by the
respondent-assessee, in this case.
4.1 Historically, prior to the fiscal year 1998-1999, the appellant-
Municipal Corporation imposed and collected taxes in
854 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
accordance with Rule No.174 ‘ka’ of the Act of 1959 from the
assessee. However, in the fiscal year 1998-1999, it came to
the Municipal Corporation’s attention that the assessee was
operating a commercial establishment within the premises.
Consequently, the appellant-Municipal Corporation conducted
an assessment based on Capital Value and issued a notice to
the assessee regarding the assessed Annual Value.
4.2 It is pertinent to note that respondent No.2, Office of the
Custodian of Enemy Property for India (for short ‘the Custodian’),
under the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India, issued
a Certificate on 03.10.2002, stating that the subject property
bearing premises No.53-54, Lawrie Building Hazaratganj,
Lucknow, is Enemy Property vested with the Custodian. The
Certificate also explicitly stated that the Custodian was obligated
to pay house tax and other local taxes on behalf of this property.
4.3 The assessee, along with other tenants, inter-alia, contested
the assessment orders issued by the Municipal Corporation and
approached the High Court of Allahabad at Lucknow by filing
Writ Petition being Misc. Bench No. 3979 of 2003. However,
this legal action was ultimately uncontested by the tenants and
was subsequently dismissed vide order dated 30.03.2017.
4.4 Due to outstanding dues of Rs.1,621,987.00/- under the
head of House Tax concerning the Enemy Property No.31/58
Hazaratganj, the Municipal Corporation, vide letter dated
28.03.2005 notified the District Magistrate, Lucknow, of its
intention to proceed with attachment and sealing of the said
premises under Sections 506-509 of the Act of 1959.
4.5 At this juncture, it is necessary to state that Raja Mohammed
Amir Mohammad Khan, the son of the Raja of Mahmudabad,
who remained in India as an Indian citizen, had been actively
seeking the release of enemy properties owned by his late
father. He contended that these properties should no longer be
vested with the Custodian after his father’s demise as they were
now vested in him, an Indian citizen. While the Government
had agreed to release 25% of these properties, it had not yet
acted upon this commitment. In response, Raja Mohammed
Amir Mohammad Khan approached the Bombay High Court
by way of filing WP No.1524 of 1997. The High Court ruled
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 855
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
in his favor, directing the Custodian to surrender possession
of the properties to him. Being aggrieved with this decision,
the Union of India approached this Court by way of filing SLP
(C) No.22452 of 2001, which was converted to Civil Appeal
No.2501 of 2002. This Court by its judgment dated 21.10.2005
reported in Union of India vs. Raja Mohammad Amir
Mohammad Khan, (2005) 8 SCC 696 (‘Amir Mohammad
Khan’), dismissed the appeal preferred by the Union of India
and directed the Union of India to get the buildings (residence
or offices) vacated from such officers and handover the
possession to Raja Mohammed Amir Mohammad Khan within
eight weeks. The Court further directed that the officers who
are in occupation of buildings for their residences or for their
offices shall immediately vacate and hand over the buildings
or the properties to the Custodian to enable him to hand over
the possession.
4.6 As a result of these orders, proceedings were initiated by
various tenants, including respondent No.1. This Court, in SLP
(Civil) No.14943 of 2006 vide order dated 08.09.2006, clarified
its earlier judgment dated 21.10.2005 passed in Civil Appeal
No.2501 of 2002. It was clarified by this Court that individuals
who were allotted properties by the Custodian or who came
into possession after 1965, i.e., following the declaration of
Raja Mahmudabad’s property as an enemy property and the
appointment of the Custodian, were required to vacate these
properties. However, persons claiming possession prior to the
Custodian’s appointment, based on valid tenancy agreements
established by Raja Mahmudabad or his General Power of
Attorney, were exempted from this directive. The enquiry
conducted in pursuance to the above orders of this Court
dated 08.09.2006 resulted in a report in favour of respondent
No.1 herein as well as other similarly situated tenants. Ergo,
they continued to remain in possession vide Amir Mohammad
Khan.
4.7 Following these events, on 28.05.2011, the appellant No.3,
issued a notice to the assessee, demanding payment of Rs.
7,57,239.00/-. The notice warned of proceedings for recovery
and attachment through the District Magistrate under Section
64 if the payment was not settled within three days.

4.8 Aggrieved by the aforesaid action, the assessee approached
the High Court of Allahabad at Lucknow by filing Writ Petition
being Misc. Bench No.2317 of 2012 seeking the following reliefs:
""(a) issue a writ of prohibition or a writ, order or direction
in the nature of prohibition prohibiting the opposite
parties no.1 & 2 not to make any assessment or
raise bill for payment of House Tax or Water Tax/
or the property in the name and style of Lawrie
Building situated at 50, Hazratganj, Lucknow being
the property of Union of India and exempted from
State taxation;
(b) issue a writ of certiorari or a writ, order or direction in
the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned bills/
recovery notice in respect of payment of House Tax
for the year 2010-11, issued by the opposite party no.I,
contained in Annexure Number 1 to the writ petition;
(c) issue a writ of certiorari or a writ, order or direction
in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned
bills/recovery notice dated 28.5.2011, issued by the
opposite party no.2, contained in Annexure Number
2 to the writ petition; and
(d) issue a writ of mandamus or a writ, order or direction
in the nature of mandamus commanding _the
respondent numbers 1 to 3 to refund the amount
of Rs.7,29,7461- and Rs.2 lacs deposited by the
petitioner along with interest at the rate of 18%
per annum and within such time as may kindly be
stipulated by this Hon’ble Court”
4.9 During the pendency of the said proceedings, appellants’ counsel
conceded that, as per the provisions of the Constitution of India,
the appellants could not levy taxes on property belonging to
the Government of India or Union properties. However, the
appellants reserved the right to demand applicable fees for
services rendered, such as water and sewerage charges.
4.10 By virtue of the impugned judgment and order dated 29.03.2017,
the High Court allowed the writ petition and quashed the recovery
notice dated 28.05.2011 on the ground that this case pertained
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 857
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
exclusively to taxes, namely House Tax and Water Tax, which
are not applicable to the respondent No.1 since the property in
question is an enemy property. The High Court further directed
respondent No.1 to make representations for the recovery of
any amounts previously paid to the appellants.
Hence, the appellants have preferred this civil appeal.
Respondent No.2 has filed his counter affidavit which we have
perused.
Submissions:
Submissions of the appellants:
5. Sri Kavin Gulati, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
Municipal Corporation, at the outset, submitted that the High Court
erroneously held that the House Tax and Water Tax levied herein
are not leviable on the assessee respondent herein in respect of
property which is admittedly an enemy property and not property
of the Union or Central Government. Therefore, it was submitted:
a) that the property is merely in the custody of the Custodian as
specified under the Act. That the preamble of the Act provides
that this is “An Act to provide for the continued vesting of
Enemy Property”. That there is no declaration by the Union
Government through any legislation declaring the properties to
be the property of the Union Government. The only declaration
that is contained is to vest the property in the Custodian without
a further declaration that the property vests absolutely in the
Union Government free from all encumbrances. That whenever
the legislature desired that any property vests absolutely in the
Central Government, it would be specifically provided so as in
the case of Sections 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act,
1984 as well as in the case of Section 269 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. But the same is conspicuous by its absence under
the Act under consideration;
b) that a perusal of the scheme of the Act, more particularly, the
Preamble, Section 2(c) and its proviso, Sections 15(1), 17(1)(c),
and 18 read with Rule 5(1) and proviso 2, 5(2), 5(3) and 15(1)
cumulatively would establish that the Custodian has certain
obligations regarding Enemy Property. However, the Central
Government or the Custodian is not vested with ownership of
858 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the same. Section 2(c), which defines enemy property reads
that it “means any property for the time being belonging to or
held or managed on behalf of an enemy…”. That the expression
“for the time being” would show that the nature of vesting is not
permanent and that the vesting is only for the management of
the enemy property;
c) that for the Union Government to claim ownership of enemy
property, it must follow the tenets of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India as well as other relevant provisions of the
Constitution, which allow the acquisition of private properties
only on payment of a fair compensation. This constitutional
right is available to all persons and not just to citizens of India.
Being aware of the aforesaid position that enemy properties
do not become properties of the Union of India, the legislature
has under Section 8(2)(vi) of the Act permitted the Custodian
for Enemy Property to deposit Municipal Taxes vis-à-vis enemy
property vested in him;
d) that even though the Union of India may have overarching
control over Enemy Properties, the status of the Union or
Central Government is not that of an owner. The Custodian is a
statutory authority in whom there is vesting of enemy property,
which is different from having ownership over the same. The
fact that the Custodian can sell properties to third parties is akin
to the powers available to a Receiver or a Liquidator who can
exercise similar powers of sale [vide Delhi Administration vs.
Madan Lal Nangia, (2003) 10 SCC 321 (“Madan Lal Nangia”)
Paras 14,15; Lieutenant Governor of Delhi vs. Matwal Chand
(Dead) through LRs, (2015) 15 SCC 576 (“Matwal Chand”),
Para 14; Municipal Commissioner of Dum Dum Municipality
vs. Indian Tourism Development Corporation, (1995) 5 SCC
251 (“Dum Dum Municipality”), Paras 14,18, 22 and 35 and
State of Andhra Pradesh vs. V.Subba Rao, 2011 SCC OnLine
AP 838 (“Subba Rao”), Paras 23-25];
e) that Article 285 (1) is not attracted to the present case as the bar
under Article 285 (1) is only applicable to the properties ‘of the
Union’. Even when the property is given on lease by the Union
to a private party, then under Section 179 of the Act of 1959,
tax is to be levied on the ‘occupier’. Reliance was placed on the
judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Electronics
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 859
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
Corporation of India vs. Secretary, Revenue Department,
Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, (1999) 4 SCC 458 (“Electronics
Corporation”) wherein it was held that Article 285 will not be
applicable in cases when the land belonging to the Government
of India was leased out to a Government Company;
f) that this Court in Union of India vs. State of Uttar Pradesh,
(2007) 11 SCC 324 held that service charges are a fee and
cannot be said to be hit by Article 285 of the Constitution;
g) that pursuant to this Court’s orders dated 19.11.2009 in Rajkot
Municipal Corporation vs. Union of India, Civil Appeal
No.9458-63 of 2003 (“Rajkot Municipal Corporation”), the
Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India issued
clarification/instructions dated 17.12.2009 to all Secretaries
(Urban Development) of all State Governments. The relevant
portion of the said clarification/instructions dated 17.12.2009
is as follows:
“(1) The UOI & its Departments will pay service
charges for the services provided by appellant
Municipal Corporations. No Property Tax. will be paid
by UOI but service charges calculated @ 75%, 50%
or 33 1/3% of Property Tax levied on property owners
will be paid, depending upon utilisation of full or partial
or Nil Services. For this, purpose agreements will
be entered into by UOI represented by concerned
Departments with respective Municipal Corporation.”
h) that due to non-payment of taxes since the year 1998-1999, Jal
Sansthan Lucknow appellant No.3 herein, served final Notice
under the provisions of the Land Revenue Act of the State of
UP to respondent No.1 to pay the pending bills of Water Tax/
Sewer Tax/Water price of Rs. 7,57,239/- by 31.03.2011;
i) that it is settled law that the exemption from state taxation of
property of the Union Government is only against property
taxes and not against all taxes including the commercial taxes
and services by local administration/authorities. However, the
High Court in its final Judgment and Order dated 29.03.2017,
erroneously equated the commercial tenancy of a private
person in Enemy Property with the property of the Central
860 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Government and accordingly, has quashed the recovery notice
dated: 28.05.2011;
j) that the Enemy Property occupied by private persons for private
business interests is not synonymous with the interest of the
State and is starkly in contrast to the objectives and scheme
of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was contended that the
interest or property of a private person i.e. respondent No.1
is not exempted from property taxes under Article 285 of the
Constitution of India;
k) that the Custodian under the Act is empowered to realize from
occupants all taxes, fees and charges and pay to the local
authority. In the present case, it is admitted by the Custodian-
respondent No.2 that local taxes are payable to the local authority
in respect of the enemy property in question vide Certificate
dated 03.10.2002;
l) that although the Municipal Commissioner granted a concession
before the High Court, the said concession was due to a threat
of summoning him to file a personal affidavit. In this regard,
learned senior counsel argued that there can be no concession
or estoppel against the statute. The power to levy tax is plenary.
If the State is held to be bound by a concession made in one
case, it would result in serious consequences for the State as
such a concession is against public interest. That it was held
in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Uttar Pradesh Rajya Khanij
Vikas Nigam Sangharsh Samiti, (2008) 12 SCC 675 that
statement, assurance, or even an undertaking of any officer
or counsel is irrelevant and that there can be no estoppel
against the statute.
With the aforesaid submission, learned senior counsel prayed that
the impugned order passed by the High Court may be set aside.
Submissions of the respondent No.1–assessee:
6. Per contra, learned senior counsel Sri Guru Krishna Kumar, appearing
for the assessee, supported the impugned judgment and submitted
that the High Court has proceeded to pass the impugned order on
a sound appreciation of the facts of the matter and the applicable
law and the same would not call for any interference by this Court.
It was further contended as under:
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 861
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
a) that the appellant-Municipal Corporation has approached the
court with unclean hands and has deliberately suppressed
critical facts. The Municipal Corporation’s reliance on the case
of Amir Mohammad Khan is misleading. In this regard, it was
submitted that the Municipal Corporation has conspicuously
omitted to disclose that the judgment in the aforementioned
case has been rendered nugatory due to the promulgation
of an Ordinance and the enactment of the Enemy Property
(Amendment and Validation) Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to
as, “Amendment Act, 2017”). Further, as a result of the said
judgment and various tenants’ claims, respondent No.1 herein
approached this Court seeking a clarification. This Court by
order dated 08.09.2006, clarified that persons in possession
of properties based on duly authenticated tenancy agreements
before the appointment of the Custodian declaring the property
as enemy property would not be covered by the judgment in
Amir Mohammad Khan. Accordingly, the respondent No.1 has
continued to be in possession.
b) Reliance was placed on the Amendment Act, 2017 as per
which the enemy property vested in the Custodian will remain
vested in the Custodian regardless of change in circumstances
such as the death of the enemy; the extinction of the enemy
status; the winding up of business or a change in nationality
of the legal heir and successor. The Act further clarifies that
“enemy property vested in the Custodian” includes all rights,
titles, and interests in or benefits arising from such property.
It includes the right of expropriation of the enemy property, in
exercise of the police powers of the State. Also, the principles
of acquisition or requisition and payment of compensation will
not apply to such a legislation.
c) that the property in question unequivocally belongs to the Central
Government, specifically the Custodian; Enemy Property is thus
‘property of the Union.’ The assessee is merely a tenant of the
Custodian of the Enemy Property and therefore, no taxes can
be levied on this property.
d) that Article 285 of the Constitution provides exemption from
State taxation in respect of properties of the Union of India.
He buttressed his submission by stating that how the property
sought to be taxed is being used is irrelevant consideration
862 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
as far as the interpretation of Article 285 of the Constitution of
India was concerned, vide NDMC vs. State of Punjab, (1997)
7 SCC 339 (“NDMC”). There is an absolute and emphatic ban
on state taxation on the property of the Union and the use of
such property is irrelevant.
e) that apart from Article 285, Section 172 of the Act of 1959
specifically provides that the Corporation may impose taxes
subject to the provisions of Article 285 of the Constitution.
Likewise, Section 177 of the said Act provides exceptions in
respect of the levy of tax amongst others to buildings and land
vesting in the Union of India. However, Section 8(2)(vi) of the
Act and/or Section 173 of the Act of 1959 cannot amount to
“law” authorizing levy of property tax on Union property in terms
of Article 285(1) of the Constitution.
f) that property vested in the Union was expressly excluded from
the scope of general tax on land and building. In this regard,
it was submitted that the impugned judgment was incorrect to
the extent that it allows Union property to be taxed on the basis
of an extended definition of ‘owner’, and is in conflict with the
judgment of this Court in NDMC and therefore, not good law.
The property in question is indisputably ‘property of the Union’
as per Article 285 of the Constitution.
g) that the declaration of a property as enemy property would be by
exercise of police power of the State. In other words, Article 300-A
only limits the powers of the State inasmuch as no person shall
be deprived of his property save by authority of law, implying that
there can be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation
by any other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under
Article 300-A. It was submitted that war between two or more
countries is a reason for which no compensation is payable for
acquisition of enemy property. The Act as amended has not been
(and cannot be) challenged by the Municipal Corporation and has
to be treated as valid and be given its full effect.
h) that the joint submission of Municipal Corporation and the Union
of India that Section 8(2)(vi) of the Act is a law relatable to Article
285 of the Constitution of India was neither raised before the
High Court nor in any pleading before this Court and is a clear
afterthought raised for the first time during oral replies;
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 863
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
i) in the alternative, this Court may balance the equities to make
the demand prospective considering the grave hardship that
the demand of entire past amount would cause to respondent
No.1 in case this Court holds against respondent No.1.
With the aforesaid submissions, it was prayed that the present
appeal be dismissed as being devoid of any merit and the
impugned order of the High Court be affirmed.
Submissions of the respondent No.2:
7. Learned counsel Sri Rupesh Kumar, appearing on behalf of the
Custodian of the subject Enemy Property, respondent No.2 herein,
submitted as under:
a) that the subject property belongs to a Pakistani National namely,
Raja of Mahmudabad and therefore, the property is vested in
the Custodian of Enemy Property for India under the Act as
amended by the Amendment Act, 2017 and is an undisputed
enemy property;
b) that the property belonging to the Union Government is exempted
from state taxation under article 285(1) of the Constitution of
India. However, there is no such exemption in respect of fee/
service charges or other charges and this position has been
conclusively decided by this Court in Union of India vs. State
of Uttar Pradesh, (2007) 11 SCC 324. Further, this stand has
been reiterated by this Court in Rajkot Municipal Corporation.
Consequently, the Ministry of Urban Development, Government
of India vide order No.11025/ 26/2003 UCD dated l7.l2.2009
issued a clarification/direction regarding the levy of taxes and
service charges in light of the judgments passed by this Court.
c) that the respondent No.2 Custodian vide his certificate dated
03.10.2002 has already clarified that it is under an obligation
to pay house tax and other local taxes as respondent No.1 is
running a private business for profit from the said premises
and therefore, not similar to a Central Government enterprise
and accordingly is liable for taxation by the local authorities;
d) that this Court in the case of NDMC has held that private parties
are not exempted from taxation. Therefore, the private person
in occupancy of enemy property for personal benefit is neither
864 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
synonymous with Central Government nor can he agitate it
before the Court.
Learned ASG Sri Balbir Singh also made submissions in the matter
later on.
With the aforesaid submissions, it was prayed for this Court to pass
orders as this Court may think fit and proper.
Submissions of the respondent No.3 - State of Uttar Pradesh:
8. State of Uttar Pradesh, at the outset, adopted the contentions raised
by the appellant-Municipal Corporation and further submitted as under:
a) Admittedly, respondent No.1-assessee is a private entity and a
lessee of the Custodian of the enemy property in question and
the demand was raised by the appellant-Municipal Corporation
on the assessee and not on the Custodian or the Central
Government. A private entity, that is running its business, on a
property and continuing on lease under the Custodian as per
the provisions of the Act cannot claim the benefit of Article 285
of the Constitution of India;
b) that the Union of India has also taken a strident stand that
though the property is vested in the Custodian for the enemy
property in India, the running of the business by respondent
No.1 is not akin or synonymous with the running of the business
by the Central Government and that therefore tax is payable
by respondent No.1 to the appellant herein;
c) that vesting, as envisaged under the Act does not make such
properties as properties owned by the Central Government or
Union properties. In this connection, reference was made to the
observations of this Court in Amir Mohammad Khan, which
shall be discussed later in the judgment.
In light of the aforesaid submissions, it was urged that the view
taken by the Hon’ble High Court in the impugned judgment and
order needs to be set aside.
Points for consideration:
9. Having heard learned senior counsel and learned counsel for
the respective parties, the following points would arise for our
consideration:
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 865
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
1. Whether statutory vesting of enemy property including the
subject property in the Custodian amounts to expropriation and
transfer of ownership so as to confer ownership of such enemy
property on the Custodian?
2. Consequently, if the ownership of such enemy property is
conferred on the Custodian for Enemy Property, whether such
property becomes Union property within the meaning of Article
285 of the Constitution and therefore, it is exempt from payment
of property or other local taxes to the appellant-Municipal
Corporation under the provisions of the Act of 1959?
3. Whether despite such enemy property becoming property of
the Union, clause (2) of Article 285 of the Constitution enables
appellant herein to impose property or other local taxes on the
respondent which is lessee of the subject property?
4. Whether the High Court was right in holding in favour of the
respondent?
5. What order?
Since these questions are inter-related, they shall be considered
together.
Preface:
9.1 Before we proceed further, we would like to preface the
discussion with a historical perspective.
9.2 Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his treatise the Social Contract said
that “War is constituted by a relation between things, and not
between persons… War then is a relation, not between man
and man, but between State and State…” The general aim of
the administration of enemy property is to eliminate enemy
influence from the national economy. The mischief that such state
instruments seek to cure is the provision of aid and comfort to
the enemy, for instance, through the making available of funds
for war financing. Enemy property can be disposed of by various
means including custodianship, liquidation, expropriation,
confiscation or nationalization. The means of custodianship
imply a fiduciary administration. The whole raison d’etre of
a statutory regime that seeks to administer enemy property
through a custodianship is to preserve and protect the properties
866 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
until the war is over. After all, the law of settlement of enemy
property is governed not only by considerations of diplomatic
strategy but also by fundamental principles of fair governance.
9.3 In 1962, in the wake of the Chinese aggression, the Custodian
of Enemy Property for India was called upon to take charge
of the Chinese assets in India with the object of vesting the
movable and immovable properties of the Chinese subjects
left in India under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 specifying
the enemy nationals and the properties held by them. Similarly,
in the wake of the Indo-Pak war of 1965 and 1971, there was
migration of people from India to Pakistan. Under the Defence
of India Rules framed under the Defence of India Act, 1962, the
Government of India took over the properties and companies
of such persons who had taken Pakistani nationality.
9.4 At this juncture, we may notice the expression ‘on behalf of an
enemy’ occurring in the definition of enemy property in Rule 133-I
of Defence of India (Amendment) Rules, 1962, and Subrule 4
of Rule 138 of Defence of India Rules, 1971 implying that the
enemy property is only held and managed by the Custodian for
a specific purpose. We ought to appreciate that the Statement
of Objects and Reasons of the Enemy Property Act, 1968 intend
to continue the vesting and maintenance of the properties by
the Custodian of Enemy Property until the Government of
India arrives at a settlement with the Governments of enemy
countries. The intent of the Parliament is further illuminated by
the Tashkent Declaration by India and Pakistan dated January
10, 1966, which included a clause stating that the two countries
would discuss the return of the properties and assets taken
over by either side in connection with the conflict.
Legal framework:
Provisions of the Act:
10. The Parliament has enacted the said Act to provide for the continued
vesting of enemy property vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property
for India under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 and the Defence
of India Rules, 1971 and for matters connected therewith.
10.1 Part IV of the Defence of India Rules, 1962 deals inter alia
with restriction of movements and activities of persons. While

Rules clearly states with a view to preserving enemy property,
the Central Government may appoint a Custodian of Enemy
Property for India and one or more Deputy Custodians and
Assistant Custodians of Enemy Property for such local areas
as may be prescribed.
The Act under consideration is essentially to provide for the

Legal status of the Custodian under the Act:
14. At this stage, it would be useful to dilate on the jurisprudential aspect
of ownership of property and examine the nuances thereof vis-à-vis
the status of the Custodian of Enemy Property for India under the Act.
892 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
14.1 According to Salmond on Jurisprudence, the expression
‘ownership’ in a generic sense, extends to all classes of
rights, whether proprietary or personal, in rem or in personam,
in re propria or in re aliena. Every man is the owner of the
rights which he owns. Ownership in its generic sense as a
relation in which a person stands to any right vested in him,
is opposed to two other possible relations between a person
and a right. In the first place, it is opposed to possession. A
man has possessory right without owning it or secondly, he
may own a right without possessing it. Thirdly, the ownership
and possession may be united as they usually are, in the
context of de jure and the de facto relation being co-existent
or coincident.
14.2 In the first of the above, possession is a de facto relationship
while the second is de jure ownership or relationship. In the
second sense, the ownership of a right is opposed to the
encumbrance of it. The owner of the right is he, in whom
the right itself is vested, while the encumbrancer of it is he,
in whom, is vested, not the right itself, but some adverse,
dominant and limiting right in respect of it. In law, there are
no separate names for every distinct kind of encumbrancer.
However, an encumbrance is opposite to ownership; every
encumbrancer is nevertheless himself the owner of the
encumbrance, that is to say, he, in whom, an encumbrance
stands in a definite relation, not merely to it, but also to the
right encumbered by it.
How is ownership acquired? :
14.3 Ownership is an important right vis-à-vis any property
and more so immovable property. What are the modes of
acquisition of ownership? Under the provisions of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882, acquisition of ownership in relation
to immovable property is by a transfer or conveyance. The
expression “transfer” is defined with reference to the word
convey which is an assurance inter vivos under the provisions
of the said Act. Thus, the transferor must have an interest
in the property before he can convey it. A person who has
no interest in the property, cannot convey any interest in the
property, in other words, he cannot sever himself from it and
yet convey it. Further, there are various modes of transfer of
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 893
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
immovable property known to law. Section 54 of the Transfer
of Property Act defines a sale to be a transfer of ownership
in exchange for a price paid or promised or part-paid and
part-promised. The definition of sale itself indicates that in
order to constitute a sale, there must be transfer of ownership
from one person to another, i.e., all rights and interests in
the property which is possessed by a person are transferred
by him with his free consent to another person for a price
called consideration. The conveyance has to be regarded
in accordance with law. Then only the transaction of sale is
complete and title in the property passes from the seller to
the buyer. The transferor cannot retain any part of his interest
or right in that property or else it would not be a sale. On
the other hand, any transfer by operation of law, or by or in
execution of a decree or order of a court within the meaning
of Section 2(d) of the Transfer of Property Act are outside the
scope of Section 54, and need not be registered. Thus, where
the property is sold at a court auction, a certificate of sale
issued by the court is enough as the purchaser’s document of
title. But in order to constitute a sale, the parties must intend
to transfer the ownership of the property for a price to be
paid in present time or in future. Sub-section (2) of Section
55 states that the seller shall be deemed to contract with the
buyer that interest which the seller professes to transfer to
the buyer which subsists and he has power to transfer the
same. Proviso thereto further states that, where the sale
is made by a person in a fiduciary character, he shall be
deemed to contract with the buyer that the seller has done
no act whereby the property is encumbered or whereby he
is hindered from transferring it.
14.4 Similarly, gift is the transfer of certain existing movable or
immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration,
by one person, called the donor, to another, called the donee,
and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. Such acceptance
must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he
is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance,
the gift is void. The donor is the person who gives. Any person
who is sui juris can make a gift of his property. Therefore, it
is only a person who is the owner of the property, can gift
894 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
his property and according to the provisions of the Transfer
of Property Act.
14.5 In the same vein, an exchange is when an exchange of
immovable property takes place when two persons mutually
transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another,
neither thing or both things being money only. A transfer of
property in completion of an exchange can be made only in
a manner provided for the transfer of such property by sale.
In the case of an exchange also, the person must have the
ownership in the property before the same can be exchanged
for any immovable property.
14.6 Similarly, transfer of ownership of movable property is by sale,
gift or exchange and in the case of a sale, the provisions of
the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 would apply.
14.7 Transfer of ownership other than transfer inter vivos is by
succession or inheritance under a testament or a will/codicil
in which case, the provisions of the Indian Succession Act,
1925 would have to be adhered to.
14.8 In the context of acquisition of land under the power of eminent
domain such as under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act,
1894 or the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency
in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013, there is divesting of ownership of the owner of the
property only when land “vests absolutely in the Government
free from all encumbrances” such as under Section 16 of
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. This Court in Fruit and
Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi
Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, AIR
1957 SC 344 has held that the property acquired becomes
the property of the Government without any conditions or
limitations either as to title or possession when it vests
free from all encumbrances in the Government. The word
encumbrances means a burden or charge upon property or a
claim or lien upon an estate or on the land. Encumber means
burden of legal liability on property, and therefore, when there
is encumbrance on a land, it constitutes a burden on the title
which diminishes the value of the land. But where the land
acquired by the State is free from all encumbrances, it vests
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 895
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
absolutely and free from all encumbrances. In such a case, it
would be an incidence of transfer of ownership from the owner
of the land to the Government as there would be divesting of
land from its true owner.
14.9 Amongst the distinct kinds of ownerships, a trust ownership
and beneficial ownership is relevant to the case. A trust is a
very important and curious instance of duplicate ownership.
According to Salmond, the trust property is that which is
owned by two persons at the same time, the relation between
the two owners being such that one of them is under an
obligation to use his ownership for the benefit of the other.
The former is called the ‘trustee’ and his ownership is the
‘trust ownership’; the latter is called the ‘beneficiary’ and his
is beneficial ownership.
14.10 The trustee’s ownership of any property is a matter of form
rather than a substance and nominal rather than real. A trustee
is not effectively an owner at all but in essence a mere agent,
upon whom the law has conferred the power and imposed
the duty of administering the property of another person. The
trustee is a person to whom the property, substantially that
of someone else is technically attributed by the law on the
footing that the rights and powers that it vests under him are
to be used by him on behalf of the real owner. As between the
trustee and beneficiary, the law recognises that the property
belongs to the latter and not to the former. But as between the
trustee and the third persons, the fiction prevails, inasmuch
as the trustee is clothed with the rights of his beneficiary and
personate or represent him in dealings with the world at large.
This principle is actuated under various provisions of the Act
including Section 8 thereof vis-à-vis an enemy who is the
owner of a property and the Custodian in whom the property
vests under the provisions of the Act. This position becomes
clear on a reading of the Rules under the Defence of India
Rules, 1962 and 1971 as discussed above.
14.11 Thus, the trusteeship is to protect the rights and interests of
persons, who, for any reason are unable effectively to protect
them for themselves. The law vests those rights and interests
for safe custody in a trustee, who is capable of guarding them
896 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and dealing with them and who is placed under an obligation
to use it for the benefit of him to whom they in truth belong.
One of the classes of persons on whose behalf the protection
of the trusteeship is called is in respect of the property of those
persons who are absent in the country, such as a person who
has migrated to a country which is described as an enemy
country by the Government of India as defined under the
provisions of the Act under consideration.
14.12 Thus, under the Act, the Custodian acts as a trustee. A trust is
more than an obligation to use the property for the benefit of
another; it is an obligation to use it for the benefit of another in
whom it is already concurrently vested. Since the beneficiary
is himself the owner of the enemy property, in the instant case,
the Custodian who is the trustee appointed under the Act is
therefore a statutory authority constituted for the administration
of the enemy property, who is only a nominal owner of the
property so administered by him vis-à-vis third parties. As
already noted, the nominal ownership in the trustee is only
for the purpose of using the rights and powers vesting with
the trustee i.e., Custodian under the Act to be used by him
or on behalf of the real owner of the property is absent, since
he has left the country for an enemy country.
14.13 The trustee or Custodian under the Act may, in pursuance
of the powers vested in him under the Act which actually
creates a trust by operation of law, can lease or mortgage the
property without the concurrence of the beneficiary under the
provisions of the Act just as the beneficiary could have dealt in
the same way with his ownership of the property independently
of the trustee as there is no bar in law to do so other than the
provisions of the Act. Thus, a relationship of trusteeship exists
between the trustee and all persons beneficially interested in
the property, either as owners or encumbrancers.
Possession:
14.14 There is another jurisprudential angle to the matter. Under the
Act the Custodian takes possession of the enemy property,
in as much as, the enemy property vests with the Custodian
under the provisions of the Act. What does this entail?
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 897
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
14.15 While discussing on the jurisprudential aspects of vesting or
taking possession in the instant case as per the provisions
of the Act, it is necessary to reiterate and bear in mind the
following aspects:
(i) That there are three possible situations: first, the
possession usually exists both in law and in fact; secondly,
the possession may exist in fact but not in law; thirdly,
the possession may exist in law but not in fact. This is
also called ‘constructive possession’. In the case of the
Custodian for Enemy Property, possession exists in law
under the provisions of the Act but may be in fact in the
hands of a third party such as a tenant or a mortgagee
of the owner of such property who is declared an enemy
under the Act.
(ii) Further, whatever may be owned may be possessed but
whatever may be possessed may not be owned. This
statement is however subject to important qualifications.
For example, there can be possession of an interested
person without ownership of any kind. Conversely, there
are many rights, which can be owned in relation to a
property but which are not capable of being possessed.
There are those which may be termed ‘transitory’. For
example, a creditor does not possess the debt that is
due to him as it is a transitory right, which in its very
nature cannot survive in exercise, but a man may possess
an easement over the land because it has exercise in
continued existence or consistent with each other.
(iii) Moving further, while discussing the concept of
possession, it is necessary to understand two elements:
first is animus possidendi. The intent necessary to
constitute possession is the intent to appropriate to
oneself the exclusive use of the thing possessed. It is
an exclusive claim to a material object for the purpose of
using the thing oneself by excluding interference of other
persons. The claim of the possessor must be exclusive,
which however need not be absolute. But animus
possidendi need not amount to a claim or intent to use
898 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the thing as owner. The tenant or a pledgee may have
possession no less real than that of the owner himself,
just as a Custodian under the provisions of the Act in
the instant case. Thus, the animus possidendi need not
be a claim on one’s own behalf. A trustee or Custodian
under the Act may have possession of enemy property,
though he claims an exclusive right of the thing on behalf
of another than himself. This is vis-à-vis third parties. He
definitely does not have a right of ownership over the
enemy property possessed by him as the ownership of
the said property continues in the enemy.
(iv) The second concept is that to constitute possession,
the animus domini is not in itself sufficient but must
be embodied in a corpus. There are two aspects with
regard to corpus of possession: first is the relationship
of the possessor to other persons and the second, is
the relation of the possessor to the thing possessed.
The necessary relation between the possessor and the
thing possessed is such as to admit of his making such
use of it as accords with the nature of the thing and of
his claim to it. There must be a correlation between him
and the thing possessed, which is not inconsistent with
the nature of the claim he makes to it.
(v) Thus, possession is acquired whenever the two elements
of corpus and animus come into co-existence and it is
lost as soon as either of them disappears.
(vi) The modes of acquisition of possession are two in
number, namely, taking and delivery. Taking is the
acquisition of possession without the consent of the
previous possessor such as in the case of the Custodian
vis-à-vis enemy property. Delivery, on the other hand is
the acquisition of possession with the consent and co-
operation of the previous possessor.
Relation between Possession and Ownership:
14.16 According to Rudolf von Ihering, a jurist “Possession is the
objective realisation of ownership”. It is in fact what ownership
is in right. Ownership is the guarantee of the law, while the
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 899
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
possession is the guarantee of the fact. Normally, ownership
and possession co-exist but not always. This aspect of the
case is crucial for answering the contentions raised by the
respective parties.
Analysis:
Let us apply the aforesaid jurisprudential principles to the provisions
of the Act under consideration.
15. Section 2 (c) of the Act defines enemy property to mean any property
for the time being belonging to or held or managed on behalf of an
enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm: That even when an
enemy subject dies in the territories to which the Act extends, or
dies in any territory outside India, any property which immediately
before his death, belonged to or was held by him or was managed
on his behalf, may, notwithstanding his death, continue to be
regarded as enemy property for the purposes of the Act. The Act
when enacted extended to the whole of India except the State of
Jammu and Kashmir and it applies also to all citizens of India outside
India and to branches and agencies outside India of companies or
bodies corporate registered or incorporated in India. On a combined
reading of the above, it is clear that the Act applies to any property
belonging to or held or managed on behalf of an enemy, an enemy
subject or an enemy firm, even if, the enemy or enemy subject or
enemy firm is outside India and to branches and agencies outside
India of companies or bodies corporate registered or incorporated in
India. That as per Explanation (1), the definition of enemy property
in clause (c) of Section 2, it is clarified that “enemy property” shall,
notwithstanding that the enemy or the enemy subject or the enemy
firm has ceased to be an enemy due to death, extinction, winding
up of business or change of nationality or that the legal heir and
successor is a citizen of India or the citizen of a country which is
not an enemy, continue and always be deemed to be continued as
an enemy property. Explanation (2) states that for the purposes of
this clause, the expression enemy property shall mean and include
and shall be deemed to have always meant and included all rights,
titles and interest in, or any benefit arising out of, enemy property in
the context of such property for the time being belonging to or held
or managed on behalf of an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy
firm. The Explanation to sub-section (3) of Section 5 of the Act also
900 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
states that for the purposes of this sub-section, “enemy property
vested in the Custodian” shall include and shall always be deemed
to have been included all rights, titles, and interest in, or any benefit
arising out of, such property vested in him under the Act.
15.1 Therefore, the moot question is, what is the nature and extent
of rights, titles, and interest in or any benefit arising out of,
such property which is vested in the Custodian? Does it mean
vesting of the ownership of the rights, titles, and interest in,
or any benefit arising out of such enemy property owned by
the enemy which becomes vested in the Custodian in the
sense that the Custodian becomes the owner of the property;
thereby there is a divesting of the ownership or a transfer of
ownership of such property from the ownership of the enemy
to the Custodian.
15.2 We do not think that such an interpretation can be given for
the simple reason that clause (c) of Section 2 clearly states
that enemy property means any property for the time being
belonging to or held or managed on behalf of an enemy, an
enemy subject or an enemy firm being vested in the Custodian.
Therefore, the provision of the Act recognises the ownership
of the enemy vis-à-vis the enemy property and the enemy
property belonging to or held or managed on behalf of an
enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm being vested in
the Custodian. What exactly is vested in the Custodian? The
Explanations i.e. Explanation (2) of clause (c) of Section 2 as
well as Explanation (2) to sub-section (3) of Section 5 of the
Act, being identical state that all rights, titles, and interest in,
or any benefit arising out of such enemy property vest in the
Custodian. This means that only the rights etc. vis-à-vis enemy
property vest in the Custodian. By that, the Custodian does
not acquire ownership rights in the property. It continues to
vest with the enemy. This is because ownership of immovable
property can be transferred from one person to another i.e.
transfer inter vivos can only transferred in accordance with
the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act.
15.3 On a conspectus reading of the aforesaid provisions, what
emerges is that under Section 3 of the Act, the Custodian
of Enemy Property for India is appointed by the Central
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 901
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
Government by issuance of a notification in the official gazette
so also Deputy Custodians and Assistant Custodians of Enemy
Property could be appointed for certain local areas as may be
specified in the notification. Since the Act is in continuation of
the Defence of India Rules, 1962 as well as Defence of India
Rules, 1971, as the case may be, the Custodian of Enemy
Property for India appointed under the aforesaid Rules shall be
deemed to have been appointed under Section 3 of the Act.
The expressions “enemy” or “enemy subject” or “enemy firm”
are defined in clause (b) of Section 2; The use of the words
“for the time being”, “belonging to” and “held” or “managed
on behalf of an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm”
in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Act are significant. The said
provision clearly recognizes ownership of the enemy property
by the enemy or property held by an enemy or managed on
behalf of an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm.
The proviso states that where an individual subject dies in
the territories to which the Act extends, any property which
immediately before his death belonged to or was held by him
or managed on his behalf, may, notwithstanding his death,
continue to be recorded as enemy property for the purposes
of this Act. This proviso clearly recognizes that the death of an
enemy would not result in the enemy property ceasing to be so.
Explanation (1) to Section 2(c) also states that enemy property
shall continue to remain as enemy property even on the death
of the enemy or extinction, winding up of business or change
of nationality to continue to remain an enemy property. This is
even if the legal heir and successor is a citizen of India or a
citizen of a country which is not an enemy country. Explanation
(2) thereof states that enemy property shall mean and include
and shall be deemed to have always meant and included all
rights, titles and interests in, or any benefit arising out of such
property. This Explanation gives meaning to the scope of the
expressions belonging to, held or managed on behalf of an
enemy, an enemy subject or enemy firm.
15.4 If a certificate is issued by the Custodian that the enemy
property has vested in him under the Act, the same shall be
evidence of the facts stated therein vide Section 5-A of the
Act. Section 5-B of the Act begins with a non obstante clause
902 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which states that nothing contained in any law for the time
being in force relating to succession or any custom or usage
governing succession of property shall apply in relation to the
enemy property under this Act and no person (including his
legal heir and successor) shall have any right and shall be
deemed not to have any right (including all rights, titles, and
interests or any benefit arising out of such property) in relation
to such enemy property. This provision regarding extinction of
rights, titles or interests or any benefit arising out of the enemy
property is deemed to have been lost is by operation of law
and by a legal fiction only in so far as a heir or successor
is concerned. If any property is vested in the Custodian as
enemy property, then no enemy or enemy subject or enemy
firm shall have any right to transfer any such property and
any such transfer shall always be deemed to have been void.
Therefore, by a deeming fiction and by operation of law the
right, title and interest in any property vested in the Custodian
under the Act shall be extinguished vis-à-vis any enemy or
enemy subject or enemy firm once such property is vested in
the Custodian only with regard to succession to such enemy
property or transfer of such property by an enemy, enemy
subject or enemy firm. This would imply that the enemy, enemy
subject as well as enemy firm would continue to remain the
owner of such property and would continue to vest with the
Custodian on the death of the enemy.
15.5 The pertinent question which arises is, whether, vesting of any
enemy property in the Custodian under the provisions of the
Act which belonged or was held or managed on behalf of an
enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm would result in
“transfer of title” in the said enemy property to the Custodian
and therefore to the Central Government or to the Union. In
order to discern an answer to this question, it is necessary to
read further the provisions of the Act from Section 7 onwards.
15.6 Section 7 states that any sum otherwise payable to an enemy,
enemy subject or an enemy firm in the form of dividend,
interests share profits or otherwise to or for the benefit of an
enemy or an enemy subject or an enemy firm, unless otherwise
ordered by the Central Government, be paid by the person by
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 903
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
whom such sum would have been payable to the Custodian
or such other person as may be authorised by him in this
behalf and shall be held by the Custodian or such person
subject to the provisions of the Act. This provision indicates
that the Custodian only holds in trust the sums payable by
any person to an enemy subject or an enemy firm. This is
because the Custodian of Enemy Property acts as a trustee
of the enemy property vested in him as well as a trustee of
all monetary dues payable to an enemy, enemy subject or
enemy firm. The Custodian shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 8, deal with any money paid to him under the Act or
under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 or 1971 as the case
may be. Further, any property vested in the Custodian under
the Act shall be dealt with by him as the Central Government
may direct.
15.7 What are the powers of the Custodian in respect of property
vested in him? This is dealt with in Section 8 of the Act. The
Custodian may take or authorise the taking of such measures
as he considers necessary or expedient for preserving
such property till it is disposed of in accordance with the
provisions of the Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 8 speaks
of eleven exigencies which a Custodian or such person as
may be specifically authorised by him may take. The same
are extracted above. A reading of the above clearly indicates
that the Custodian or his authorised person can carry on the
business of the enemy; fix and collect the rent etc. in respect
of enemy property; take action for recovering any money due
to the enemy; make any contract and execute any document
in the name and on behalf of the enemy; institute or defend
any legal proceeding; secure vacant possession of the enemy
property; raise on the security of the property such loans as
may be necessary; incur out of the property any expenditure
including payment of any taxes, duties, cesses and rates to
Government, or to any local authority, pay wages, salaries,
pensions, etc. to or in respect of any employee of the enemy
and repayment of any debts due by the enemy to persons
other than enemies; transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
enemy properties; invest any moneys held by him on behalf
of the enemies for the purpose of Government securities
904 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
etc.; make payments to the enemy at his dependants; make
payments on behalf of the enemy to persons other that those
enemies, of dues outstanding; make such other payments out
of the funds of the enemy as may be directed by the Central
Government.
15.8 What emerges from the above is that the activities that the
Custodian or his authorised person carries out vis-à-vis the
enemy such as the business of the enemy or in respect of
managing the enemy property would also clearly indicate that
the Custodian of the Enemy Property holds the said property
in trust or as a trustee and not as an owner of the enemy
property or by exercising rights of ownership over the enemy
property. Carrying on the business of the enemy and dealing
with the property of the enemy vested in the Custodian is
in order to protect the business belonging to an enemy or
enemy subject or enemy firm, who has left the country. The
Custodian of Enemy Property for India who acts on behalf of
the Enemy holds in trust the enemy property vested in him
under the provisions of the Act. He does so as a trustee and
therefore, the principles and legal doctrines applicable to a
trustee are applicable to the Custodian accordingly.
15.9 It is trite that a trustee or Custodian in the instant case can
never be the owner of the property. The vesting of property
in a trustee or the Custodian which, in the instant case, is
enemy property as defined under the Act is for the purpose
of managing the said property and protecting it, so that
the property does not fall into the hands of trespassers,
unauthorised persons or render it as being ownerless and
therefore, a free for all, so to say owing to the absence of the
owner. The object and purpose of the Act is to ensure that
the enemy property, which vests in the Custodian, is held in
trust and is looked after, protected and managed as per the
provisions of the Act. The statement of objects and reasons
of the Act makes this position clear.
Jurisprudential aspect of vesting:
16. A discussion on the aforesaid provisions under the Act would indicate
that the Custodian takes charge of the enemy property which vests
in him by operation of law. Then the following questions would arise:
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 905
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
(i) Does vesting of enemy property in the Custodian imply that the
Custodian assumes ownership rights vis-à-vis enemy property
vested in him?
(ii) Secondly, whether the vesting of enemy property in the
Custodian would imply that it becomes the property of the Union?
These are the two crucial questions which are required to be answered
in this case in order to decide the matter in all its perspectives.
16.1 The expression ‘vest’ or ‘vesting’ has no precise definition and
it would depend upon the context in which the expression is
used under a particular enactment. This Court has held that
the expression ‘vest’ is of fluid or flexible content and can, if
the context so dictates, bear the limited sense of “being in
possession and enjoyment”. (See: Maharaj Singh vs. State
of Uttar Pradesh, (1977) 1 SCC 155) (Para 18)]. In Dr. M.
Ismail Faruqui vs. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 360 : AIR
1995 SC 605, it was observed that the word ‘vest’ has to be
understood in the different contexts in which the word occurs.
In the context of acquisition of certain area under the Ayodhya
Act, 1993, it was observed that the vesting of the disputed area
in Central Government is limited, as a statutory receiver, with
the duty of its management and administration. According to
Section 7 of the said Act, till it is handed over in terms of the
adjudication made in the suit, the word ‘vest’ takes varying
colours from the context and the situation in which the word
is used in the statute.
Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, vesting in the State,
is from the date of taking possession under Sections 16 or
17(2) which is free from all encumbrances. But under the
Land Reforms Act like abolition of estates and taking over
thereof, the vesting takes effect from the date of publication
of the notification in the official gazette until the occupant of
the land is granted the occupancy rights. This is however
not the position when enemy property vests in the Custodian
under the provisions of the Act. The vesting of enemy property
in the Custodian is not free from encumbrances. Therefore,
the expression ‘vest’ has no fixed connotation. It is a word of
variable input and therefore has to be understood in different
contexts and under different circumstances. Therefore, the
906 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
context and situation in which the word is used in the statute
is significant in order to interpret the said expression. Under
certain statutes, the word ‘vesting’ would mean placing into
possession and not conferring ownership of the person who
comes into possession of property. Therefore, the word ‘vesting’
is a word of variable input and has more than one meaning
which must be discerned and the exact connotation must be
found by looking into the scheme of law and the context in
which it is used. The setting in which it is used would lend
colour to it and divulge the legislative intent.
In State of Gujarat vs. The Board of Trustees of Port of
Kandla, (1979) 1 GLR 732, (“Trustees of Port of Kandla”),
it was observed that the vesting of property in the Board of
trustees is for the limited purpose of administration, control
and management only without the Central Government having
divested itself of ownership. Thus, vesting of property in a
person or authority does not always mean transfer of absolute
title in the property.
In Bibhutibhushan Datta vs. Anadinath Datta, AIR 1934
Cal 87, (“Bibhutibhusan Datta”), it was observed that mere
transference of management or control of a property, when
transfer of proprietary rights is not intended, the requirements of
vesting is not satisfied in terms of Section 10 of the Limitation Act.
Under the Act under consideration, the vesting of the enemy
property in the Custodian is not free from encumbrances but
vesting is in accordance with the status of the property as
held by the enemy, enemy subject or enemy firm prior to its
vesting. Therefore, only when enemy property vests in the
Custodian free from all encumbrances it will be a transfer of
ownership from the owner of such property to the Custodian.
This is because under the Act, Custodian holds or manages
the property for and on behalf of the enemy, enemy subject
or enemy firm only temporarily and there is no transfer of
ownership to the Custodian or the Union of India. Hence, there
is no necessity of payment of compensation to the owners of
such properties.
Under Section 5A of the Act under consideration, when property
vests in the Custodian under the provision of the Act, he may
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 907
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
issue a certificate to that effect and such certificate shall be
evidence of the facts stated therein. Further, under Section 7
(1) of the Act, any sum payable by way of dividend, interest,
share profits or otherwise to or for the benefit of an enemy or
an enemy subject or an enemy firm shall, unless otherwise
ordered by the Central Government, be paid by the person by
whom such sum would have been payable to the Custodian
or such person as may be authorised by him in that behalf
and shall be held by the Custodian or such person subject to
the provisions of the Act. Under Section 7 (3) of the Act, the
Custodian shall, subject to Section 8 of the Act, can deal with
any money paid to him or any property vested in him under
the Act in such manner as the Central Government may direct.
Section 8-A of the Act begins with a non-obstante clause and it
states that notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment,
decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority or
any law for the time being in force, the Custodian may, within
such time as may be specified by the Central Government in
this behalf, dispose of whether by sale or otherwise, as the
case may be, with prior approval of the Central Government,
by general or special order, enemy properties vested in
him immediately before the date of commencement of the
Amendment Act, 2017 in accordance with the provisions of
this Act, as amended by the Amendment Act, 2017. The sale
proceeds have to be deposited into the Consolidated Fund of
India and the details thereof have to be intimated to the Central
Government. The directions issued by the Central Government,
by way of general or special order, vis-à-vis disposal of enemy
property is binding upon the Custodian and the buyer of the
enemy properties and the other persons connected to such
sale or disposal. Further, instead of the Custodian disposing
of enemy property, any Ministry or Department of the Central
Government may do so as authorised and the provision of
Section 8A applies to such authority or Ministry or Department.
The Central Government can also deal with or utilise enemy
property in such manner as it may deem fit.
The scheme of Section 8A of the Act is only to regulate the
disposal of the enemy property by the Custodian bearing in
mind the guidelines and/or directions issued by the Central
908 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Government and to deposit the sale proceeds into the
Consolidated Fund of India. The Custodian would nevertheless
be acting as a trustee of the enemy property but under the
directions of the Central Government as the Custodian is
appointed under the Central Government and he, with the
prior approval of the Central Government may dispose of the
enemy property for valid reasons. It could be for the reasons
that there is no succession to the enemy property or the said
property is in a dilapidated condition or, if for any reason,
there is litigation or legal or other complications arising which
would make it difficult for the Custodian as the trustee of such
property to manage the same. In such circumstance, there
could be alienation of the said property. On such alienation, the
sale proceeds would have to be deposited in the Consolidated
Fund of India, as the Custodian, being an officer appointed
under the provisions of the Act by the Central Government,
would be discharging his duties under the Act. But the power
of sale of an enemy property as envisaged under Section 8A
of the Act, in our view, would also not imply that the Custodian
would be acting as the owner of the property but only as a
Custodian of such property. This view is further supported
by Section 9 of the Act, which states that all enemy property
vested in the Custodian under the Act shall be exempt from
attachment, seizure or sale in execution of a decree of a
civil court or orders of any other authority. Therefore, it is the
duty of the Custodian as the trustee of the enemy property
to ensure that the said property is saved from attachment,
seizure or sale in execution of a decree of a civil court or
orders of any other authority.
Section 10 of the Act also categorically states that where
the Custodian proposes to sell any security issued by a
company and belonging to an enemy, the company may,
with the consent of the Custodian, purchase the securities,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law or in any
regulations of the company and any securities so purchased
may be re-issued by the company as and when it thinks fit
so to do. Where the Custodian executes and transfers any
securities, he has to register them (securities) in the name
of the transferee, notwithstanding that the regulations of the
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 909
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
company do not permit such registration in the absence of
the certificate, script or other evidence of title relating to the
securities transferred. The expression securities includes
shares, stocks, bonds, debentures and debenture stock but
does not include bills of exchange.
On sale of any immovable property vested in him to any
person and on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property,
the Custodian has to issue a certificate of sale in favour of
the transferee and even in the absence of handing over the
original title deeds of the property, the sale shall be valid and
conclusive proof of transfer of ownership of such property to
such person, who has the certificate registered in his name.
Such transfer is obviously from the owner of the enemy property
who is represented by the Custodian who only executes the
sale and transfers the ownership of such property from the
ownership of the enemy, enemy subject or enemy firm to the
buyer of such property. The Custodian does not sell the enemy
property as the owner of such property as no ownership rights
are vested in him.
Section 15 of the Act states that the Custodian may call from
persons who, in his opinion, have any interest in, or control
over, any enemy property vested in him under this Act, such
returns as may be prescribed. In such an event, every person
from whom a return is called for shall be bound to submit
such return within the prescribed period. All such returns shall
be recorded in such registers as may be prescribed, which
shall be open to inspection subject to reasonable restrictions
as may be imposed by the Custodian, if in the opinion of the
Custodian, the person seeking inspection is interested in any
particular enemy property as a creditor or otherwise.
Such being the position of a Custodian, who under the Act,
acts as the trustee for the enemy property under the Act and
not as the owner of the property, but as a protector of the
property vested in him, the Custodian can never be an owner
or having any right, title or interest in the enemy property
as owner. While Section 5-B states that any law related to
succession or any custom or usage governing succession of
property shall not apply in relation to enemy property under
910 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the Act as no person including a legal heir and successor of
an enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm shall be deemed
to have any right, title or interest or any benefit arising out
of such property in relation to enemy property, this provision
does not at the same time confer any right, title and interest
or any benefit arising out of enemy property in the Custodian
for Enemy Property. A Custodian is thus only a trustee of the
enemy property. In the absence of any transfer of ownership
or any benefit arising from enemy property being conferred on
the Custodian, he acts merely as a trustee of the said property
and not as the owner of enemy property. The Explanation to
Section 5(3) states that for the purpose of that sub-section
only ‘enemy property vested in the Custodian’ shall always be
deemed to have included all rights, titles and interests in or
any benefit arising out of such property vested in him under
the Act. This is by a deeming provision and by a fiction only
for the limited purpose of extinction of rights of succession
on the death of the enemy or extinction or winding up of the
business of enemy property or change of nationality of the
legal heir or successor.
Thus, if no ownership rights are conferred on the Custodian and
he is appointed vis-à-vis any enemy property as a Custodian, in
law, he cannot be construed to be the owner of such property.
This position is also discerned from the manner in which the
Custodian acts vis-à-vis the enemy property as a protector of
such property and not as its owner. If the Custodian himself
cannot be construed to be the owner of the enemy property,
then much less the Central Government or Union can be
considered to be the owner of such property. In our view,
the Union or the Central Government cannot usurp rights of
ownership and exercise all such rights of ownership vis-à-vis
enemy property. In the absence of any provision conferring
such ownership on the Custodian, the Central Government,
which appoints the Custodian of Enemy Property in India by
issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette to carry on
his functions under the provisions of the Act, cannot assume
ownership rights over such property. The same is having regard
to the fact that the Act is a piece of parliamentary legislation
and therefore, the State Legislatures or Governments have
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 911
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
no competence to take steps under the Act and therefore,
the Central Government appoints the Custodian of Enemy
Property in India.
17. However, it was contended by Sri Balbir Singh, learned ASG appearing
along with Sri Rupesh Kumar, learned counsel for the Custodian that
by the appointment of the Custodian by the Central Government, the
powers of the Custodian in respect of enemy property vested in him
and such other actions that he may take vis-à-vis enemy property,
would clearly indicate that the Custodian acts at the behest of the
Central Government and therefore, the enemy property becomes
Union property even though the same is vested in the Custodian
who, in any case, is appointed by the Central Government. In order
to buttress this submission, our attention was drawn to Section 8-A
which begins with a non-obstante clause and which states that
the Custodian may, with the approval of the Central Government,
dispose of enemy property by sale or otherwise, as the case may
be, the enemy property vested in him immediately before the date
of commencement of the Amendment Act, 2017, in accordance with
the provisions of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act, 2017.
Further, the Custodian, on disposal of enemy property, has to deposit
the sale proceeds into the Consolidated Fund of India immediately
and intimate details thereof to the Central Government. Also, the
Custodian has to submit a report of the enemy properties disposed
of enclosing details of sale etc. The Central Government may also
issue directions and guidelines to the Custodian in matters related
to disposal of enemy property which are binding on the Custodian
and the buyer. Moreover, the Central Government may deal with or
utilise the enemy property in a manner as it may deem fit. On sale of
any enemy property vested in the Custodian to any person he may,
on receipt of the sale proceeds of such property, issue a certificate
of sale notwithstanding the fact that the original title deeds of the
property have not been handed over to that transferee. That once
such certificate of sale is issued, the same shall be valid as conclusive
proof of ownership of property by such person. Further, the certificate
issued by the Custodian shall be a valid instrument for registration of
the property in favour of the transferee as the registration in respect
of enemy property for which such certificate has been issued by the
Custodian, shall not be refused on the ground of lack of original title
deeds in respect of such property or for any other matter.
912 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
17.1 In our view, although the Custodian for the Enemy Property is
empowered to alienate enemy property under the provisions of
the Act, he does so as a trustee of the said property and not
as the owner thereof or as the Central Government being the
owner. As already stated, the ownership continues to remain
with the enemy but the management and the custody of the
property only remain with the Custodian and in the absence
of the enemy, the Custodian is empowered to sell or alienate
such property and can issue a sale certificate as is expedient
to do so. This is in the interest of or benefit of the enemy
property. Thus, the transfer of such enemy property by sale or
otherwise is for and on behalf of the enemy who is not available
in the country and in order to ensure that such property is not
dissipated owing to the owner of the property being absent in
the country. Thus in order to protect the enemy property, the
Custodian is empowered to even sell the enemy property and
deposit the sale proceeds with the Central Government. The
sale or transfer of ownership of the enemy property in favour
of the transferee is, in fact, on behalf of the enemy who is the
owner of the property through the legal and statutory authority
of the Custodian which empowers him to alienate the property
for good and sound reasons and in the interest of the enemy
property irrespective of whether there is any claim made by
the enemy or his heirs or descendants. It is for this reason
that the original title deeds may remain with the enemy or his
family vis-à-vis the enemy property and in lieu of handing over
of the title deeds of the property to the vendee or purchaser
of the enemy property, a certificate of sale is issued in favour
of such person by the Custodian and such certificate of sale
is a valid instrument for seeking registration of the property in
favour of the transferee. When the registration of the sale is
made in favour of the transferee by the Custodian, the latter
is acting as a trustee and not as the owner of the enemy
property. Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the Custodian
is acting as the owner of the property and by that logic the
enemy property would become the property of the Union.
17.2 Further, since the Custodian is the trustee of the enemy
property, if any monies are due to the enemy or if any order
has been made with regard to enemy property vested in the
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 913
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
Custodian which are paid or complied with by any person,
as the case may be, and a certificate is issued in that regard
by the Custodian, such a person, to whom the certificate is
issued, shall not be liable to any suit or other legal proceeding,
by reason only of such compliance. This aspect also indicates
that payment made to the Custodian is payment to the enemy,
enemy subject or enemy firm who accepts the same for and
on behalf of the enemy and the payer is thus absolved of all
his liabilities and obligations to the enemy.
17.3 In Amir Mohammad Khan, it was observed by this Court
that vesting of enemy property in the Custodian is limited
to temporary possession, management and control of the
property till it becomes incapable of being used by the enemy
subject for carrying on business and trading therein. This does
not divest the enemy subject of his right, title and interest in
the property. The aforesaid two aspects are totally distinct.
However, in the said case this Court observed that on the
death of the enemy subject the said property would cease to
be enemy property if the same is succeeded to by his heir
who is a citizen of India. Hence the Custodian could not be
permitted to continue with the possession thereof and would
be duty bound to release the property to the true owner. In
our view, it is only in respect of succession to the enemy
property on death of the enemy which has been abrogated
by the Parliament by insertion of Explanations (1) and (2)
to clause (b) of Section 2 which defines enemy or enemy
subject or enemy firm which are with effect from 21.03.2018.
Therefore, the jurisprudential position of the Custodian for
Enemy Property vis-à-vis the enemy continues to remain as
that of a trustee although the enemy property may vest in such
Custodian for the protection, preservation and management
thereof. Thus, such vesting of property in the Custodian does
not result in the transfer of ownership from the owner of the
property who is an enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm
within the meaning of clause (b) of Section 2 of the Act to
the Custodian. When the Custodian appointed by the Central
Government in whom enemy property vests is only a trustee
and does not adorn the status of an owner of such enemy
property, consequently, the Central Government or the Union
914 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
even within the meaning of Article 285 of the Constitution
cannot usurp the ownership of such property.
17.4 That when enemy property is not the property of the Union
within the meaning of Article 285 of the Constitution, there is
no exemption from taxes imposed on by a State or by any
authority within a State. When the aforesaid position of law
was discussed during the course of submission and specifically
put to Sri Balbir Singh, learned ASG by the Bench, the
response was that the enemy property being the property of
the Union is exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by
any authority within a State, save insofar as Parliament may
by law otherwise provide. That in the instant case, Section
8(2)(vi) authorises the Custodian to make payments out of
the enemy property any taxes, dues, cesses or rates to the
State Government or to any local authority and therefore, the
Parliament has by the said provision authorised the payment
of taxes to the State Government or the local authority such
as the appellant herein and hence, there is no exemption
from payment of taxes in respect of enemy property which is
by that reason Union property. In other words, the contention
was premised on the fact that once the enemy property vests
in the Custodian, it automatically becomes the property of
the Union and having regard to the saving clause in Articles
285(1) of the Constitution, and bearing in mind Section 8(2)
(vi) of the Act, there is no exemption from the payment of
property tax in the instant case.
17.5 Thus, while both the appellant-Municipal Corporation or Nagar
Nigam and the Union of India are at ad idem on the legal
position that the property tax is liable to be paid to the appellant
in the instant case but it is for different reasons or basis.
17.6 In this context, Mr. Kavin Gulati, learned senior counsel for
the appellant emphasised that the subject property in question
is not Union property but it is enemy property vested with
the Custodian under the Act and continues to be so and is
therefore, subject to payment of taxes, etc. to the appellant-
Corporation and Section 8(2)(vi) is only an enabling provision.
The Custodian collects the taxes on behalf of the enemy and
pays it to the appellant and not as owner of the enemy property.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 915
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
17.7 Per contra, Shri Guru Krishna Kumar, learned senior counsel
appearing for the respondent-lessee contended that the subject
property being enemy property vested with the Custodian under
the Act is the property of the Union or Central Government
and therefore, is exempt from any taxation under clause (1)
of Article 285 of the Constitution.
17.8 Interestingly, while both learned ASG Sri Balbir Singh,
appearing for the Union of India and Sri Gurukrishna Kumar,
learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-lessee
have contended that the subject property is Union property,
between them there is also a difference in their stand in
the matter. While learned ASG contended that there is no
exemption from payment of municipal taxes, on the other hand,
learned senior counsel Sri Gurukrishna Kumar appearing for
the respondent-lessee contended that the subject property
being Union property is totally exempt from any kind of taxes
to be paid to any Government or local authority.
17.9 But in view of our above analysis, we hold that the vesting of
enemy property in the Custodian does not transfer ownership
of such property in the Custodian and by that process in
the Union or Central Government, but since the Custodian
is only a trustee of the enemy property, the same is liable
to tax in accordance with law, including to the appellant
herein. The Custodian is only authorised to pay the taxes
on the subject enemy property by virtue of sub-section (2)
of Section 8 of the Act. The Custodian while doing so is not
acting on behalf of the Union Government being the owner of
the enemy property, rather, the Custodian who is appointed
by the Central Government under the provisions of the Act,
which is a Central legislation only discharges his duties and
functions under the provisions of the Parliamentary legislation
i.e. the Act under consideration. Such discharge of duties and
functions, including the payment of taxes vis-à-vis enemy
property vested in him would not also by the same logic imply
that the Custodian is acting as if the property vested in him
has become the Union property. We emphasise again that
mere vesting of enemy property in the Custodian does not
transfer ownership of the same from the enemy to the Union
or to the Central Government; the ownership remains with
916 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the enemy but the Custodian only protects and manages the
enemy property and in discharging his duties as the Custodian
or the protector of enemy property he acts in accordance with
the provision of the Act and on the instructions or guidance
of the Central Government. The reason as to why the Central
Government is empowered to issue guidelines or instructions
to the Custodian is because the Custodian is appointed under
the Act which is a Parliamentary legislation and the reason
why the Parliament has passed the said law is in order to
have a uniformity vis-à-vis all enemy properties throughout
the length and breadth of the country in that the same are
protected, managed and dealt with uniformly in accordance
with the provisions of the Act.
18. We say so because Article 300-A of the Constitution states that
no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of
law. The word “law” is with reference to an Act of Parliament or of
a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having the force of
law. Although, to hold property is not a fundamental right, yet it is a
constitutional right. The expression person in Article 300-A covers
not only a legal or juristic person but also a person who is not a
citizen of India. The expression property is also of a wide scope and
includes not only tangible or intangible property but also all rights,
title and interest in a property. Deprivation of property may take
place in various ways, but where there is only control of property
short of deprivation would not entail payment of compensation vide
Indian Handicrafts Emporium vs. Union of India, (2003) 7 SCC
589, (Paras 109 and 111) and Chandigarh Housing Board vs.
Major-General Devinder Singh (Retd.), (2007) 9 SCC 67, (Para
11). However, deprivation of property is to be distinguished from
restriction of the rights following from ownership, which falls short
of dispossession of the owner from those rights. Deprivation also
takes within its nomenclature acquisition in accordance with law and
not without any sanction of law. Before a person can be deprived of
his right to property, the law must expressly and explicitly state so.
Thus, the expression by authority of law means by or under a law
made by the competent Legislature.
18.1 In KT Plantation Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Karnataka,
(2011) 9 SCC 1, it was observed that though the right to
claim compensation or the obligation of the State to pay
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 917
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
compensation to a person who is deprived of his property is
not expressly included in Article 300-A of the Constitution, it
is in-built in the Article. Within the scope of Article 300-A the
doctrine of eminent domain could also be read inasmuch as
the said doctrine states that the acquisition of property must
be in the public interest and there must be payment of just and
fair compensation therefor. When acquisition of property takes
place either under the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 or the Right
to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, it is always for a
public purpose and on payment of compensation to the owner
of the said property. The State then possesses the power
to take control of the property of the owner thereof for the
benefit of the public and when the State so acts it is obliged
to compensate the owner upon making just compensation as
the owner of the property would lose all his rights vis-à-vis
the acquired land.
18.2 However, this position has to be distinguished vis-à-vis the
Custodian for Enemy Property under the Act, as he takes
possession of the enemy property only for the purpose of
managing the same as per the provisions of the Act and
does not become the owner of the property inasmuch as the
ownership of the property from the enemy or enemy subject
or enemy firm does not get transferred to the Custodian. On
the other hand, if it is to be recognised that ownership of the
property gets transferred from the enemy to the Custodian
who takes possession of the property and administers it or
manages it and thereby the ownership would then be that
of the Union, in that event, it would be a deprivation of the
property of the true owner who may be an enemy or an
enemy subject or enemy firm but such deprivation of property
cannot be without payment of compensation. Having regard to
the salutary principles of Article 300-A of the Act, we cannot
construe the taking possession of the enemy property for
the purpose of administration of the same by the Custodian,
as an instance of transfer of ownership from the true owner
to the Custodian and thereby to the Union. This position is
totally unlike the position under the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 or the subsequent legislation of 2013
918 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which are expropriatory legislations under which acquisition
of land would inevitably result in transfer of the ownership of
the land from the owner to the State which is the acquiring
authority, but the same would be subject to payment of a
reasonable and fair compensation to the owner.
18.3 Further even under Article 296 of the Constitution, the manner
in which ownership of certain types of property gets vested
directly with the Union is stated when such property vests
with the Union by virtue of the application of the doctrine of
escheat or doctrine of bona vacantia. But under the provisions
of the Act, the Custodian is appointed only to protect the
property and to manage it as a trustee and not as an owner
by vesting in the Custodian free from all encumbrances. By
that, the Union cannot assume rights of ownership over such
property through the Custodian.
19. Therefore, we see no substance in the arguments of learned ASG
appearing for the Union of India as well as that of Sri Guru Krishna
Kumar appearing for the respondent-lessee to the effect that enemy
property vested with the Custodian becomes property of the Union.
20. There is another angle to the case which revolves around Article
285 of the Constitution. Clause (1) of Article 285 of the Constitution
corresponds to the first paragraph of Section 154 and clause (2)
corresponds to the proviso to Section 154 of the Government of
India Act, 1935. For a more comprehensive understanding of the
subject, it would also be useful to read Articles 286, 287, 288, 289
and Article 296 also.
Article 289:
21. Clause (1) of Article 289 exempts from Union taxation any income of
a State, whether it is derived from governmental or non-governmental
activities. However, an exception is provided in clause (2) thereof in
that the income derived by a State from trade or business would be
taxable, provided a law is made by Parliament in that behalf. Clause
(3) is an exception to the exception prescribed in clause (2) which
states that the income derived from a particular trade or business
may still be immune from Union taxation if Parliament declares that
the said trade or business is incidental to the ordinary functions of
Government. This Article broadly corresponds to Section 155 of the
Government of India Act, 1935 but has certain other conditions thereto.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 919
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
Articles 285 and 289 provide for the immunity of the property of
the Union and the State from mutual taxation on the basis of the
Federal principle.
NDMC is a decision of nine-Judge Bench which dealt with a question
whether the properties owned and occupied by various States within
the National Capital Territory of Delhi are entitled to be exempted from
the levy of taxes under the provision of Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, 1957 and New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 by virtue of
the provisions of Article 289(1) of the Constitution. The pertinent
question was, whether, by virtue of Article 289(1), the States are
entitled to exemption from the levy of taxes imposed by laws made
by Parliament under Article 246(4) upon their properties situated
within Union Territories. The Delhi High Court had taken the view
that the properties of the States situated in the Union Territory of
Delhi are exempt from property taxes levied under the municipal
enactments in force in the Union Territory of Delhi. The said view
was challenged in the appeals preferred by the New Delhi Municipal
Council and the Delhi Municipal Corporation which are functioning
under the respective parliamentary enactments.
While considering Article 285 as well as the Article 289 of the
Constitution which deal with exemption of property of the Union from
State taxation and exemption of property and income of State from
Union taxation, respectively, by a 5:4 majority judgment speaking
through B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., it was observed that in a federation
there are two coalescing units, namely, the Federal Government
or the Centre and the States or the Provinces. Articles 285 and
289 deal with the concept of doctrine of immunity from taxation.
While the immunity created in favour of the Union is absolute, the
immunity created in favour of the States is a qualified one. Article
285 provides a complete and absolute ban on all taxes that could be
imposed by a State on Union property. There is no way in which a
State Legislature can levy a tax upon the property of the Union but
Article 289 is distinct. Although, the property and income of a State
is exempt from Union taxation, the same is qualified inasmuch as
the aforesaid ban imposed by clause (1) of Article 289 would not
prevent the Union from imposition or from imposing or authorising
the imposition of, any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament may
by law provide in respect of - (a) a trade or business of any kind
carried on by, or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or (b) any
920 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
operations connected such trade or business or (c) or any property
used or occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or
(d) any income accruing or arising in connection with such trade or
business.
Article 289 clause (3) empowers Parliament to declare, by law,
which trade or business or any class of trades or businesses is
incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government, whereupon
the trades/businesses so specified go out of the purview of clause
(2) of Article 289. It was held that levy of taxes on property by the
Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (as extended to Part ‘C’ State (Law)
Act, 1950), the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and the New
Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (both parliamentary enactments)
constitute “Union taxation” within the meaning of Article 289(1). That
by virtue of the exemption provided by clause (1), taxes are not
leviable on State properties but clauses (1) and (2) of Article 289
go together, form part of one scheme and have to be read together.
Therefore, Municipal Laws of Delhi are inapplicable to the properties
of State Government to the extent such properties are governed and
saved by clause (1) of Article 289 and that insofar as the properties
used or occupied for the purpose of a trade or business carried on
by the State Government, the ban in clause (1) does not avail to
them and the taxes thereon must be held to be valid and effective.
It was observed that the levy of the property taxes under the three
enactments, namely, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957; the
New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 and the Punjab Municipal Act,
1911 are valid to the extent the provisions related to land and building
owned by State Government and used or occupied for the purposes
of any trade or business carried on by the State Government. In other
words, the levy is invalid and inapplicable only to the extent of those
lands or buildings which are not used or occupied for the purposes
of any trade or business carried on by the State Government. That
it is for the authority under the said enactment to determine with
notice to the affected State Government, which land or building is
used or occupied for the purpose of any trade or business carried
out or on behalf of that State Government. It was further observed
that the said judgment was to operate prospectively commencing on
01.04.1996 onwards by invoking the Article 142 of the Constitution.
Another aspect which was argued in the said case was that the
exemption provided by clause (1) of Article 289 would not apply to
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 921
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
compensatory taxes like water tax, drainage tax and so on. However,
it was contended that even in respect of a composite taxes, known
as property tax, insofar as the taxes on the services are concerned,
the ban under clause (1) of Article 289 would not apply. However,
the Court did not express any opinion on this aspect of the matter.
Article 285:
21.1 Article 285 speaks about the doctrine of immunity restricting
the taxing powers of the governments in a federation. The
doctrine is based on the principle that there ought to be inter-
governmental tax immunities between the Centre and the
States. In a Constitution such as ours which has a federal
character, where both the Union and State Governments have
the powers to levy taxes even on governmental property,
the immunity is intended for the smooth working of the
Governments and for saving time and efforts in cross taxation.
Clause (1) of Article 285 deals with immunity of the property of
the Union from State taxation. Article 285 embodies a narrower
aspect of the doctrine of “Immunity of Instrumentalities” as
propounded in the United States inasmuch as it exempts only
property and not the functions or instrumentalities of the Union.
21.2 Article 285(1) states that the property of the Union shall be
exempted from all taxes imposed by the State or by any
authority within a State unless so provided for by the Parliament
by law. Clause (2) of Article 285 states that nothing in clause
(1) shall prevent any authority within a State from levying any
tax on any property of the Union to which such property was
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution
liable or treated as liable, so long as that tax continues to
be levied in that State. Clause (2) of Article 285 is a clause
which is transitional in nature and is in the nature of a saving
clause intended to save all taxes levied on the property of the
Union prior to the commencement of the Constitution so long
as the taxes continues to be levied in that State. However,
this saving clause is subject to any law that the Parliament
may provide otherwise.
21.3 While applying clause (1) of Article 285, two considerations
must be taken into account: firstly, whether the tax is claimed
in respect of property, and secondly, whether such property
922 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is vested in the Union Government. The expression property
must be given its widest meaning to include both tangible
and intangible property as well as moveable and immovable
property. The immunity conferred under clause (1) of the Article
285 is only in respect of a tax on property. The rationale for
providing Articles 285 and 289 of the Constitution is based on
the principle that one sovereign cannot tax another sovereign.
Thus, under Article 285, all property of the Union is exempted
from State taxes, while Article 289 exempts all incomes and
property of a State from Union taxation; no distinction is made
between the Union property used for commercial purposes or
used for governmental functions. Thus, irrespective of use of
the Union property is put to, there is an exemption.
21.4 The expression ‘vest’ is not found in Article 285, though, it
occurred in Section 154 of the Government of India Act, 1935.
However, this does not really make a difference, so long as the
owner of the property is the Union. For instance, property which
is requisitioned by the Union does not affect the ownership of
the requisitioned property. But, if the Union Government erects
buildings on requisitioned lands, the buildings become property
of the Union within the meaning of Article 285 although, the
Union is not the owner of the land upon which the building
stands vide The Governor-General of India in Council vs.
The Corporation of Calcutta, AIR 1948 Cal 116 affirmed by
The Corporation of Calcutta vs. Governors of St. Thomas’
School, Calcutta, AIR 1949 FC 121.
21.5 The immunity from taxation on property of the Union therefore
depends upon the factum of the ownership of the property. If
a property accrues to the Union by escheat, lapse or bona
vacantia under Article 296 of the Constitution, such property
would be immune from State taxation. Thus, where the Union
Government is not the owner of the property but is a lessee
from a private owner, a tax on such owner is not exempted
under Article 285 of the Constitution. Similarly, where the Union
Government is using the property for governmental purposes or
has control over its use, does not give it immunity from State
taxation. Conversely, where the Government is the lessor, a tax
on the interest of the private lessee is not a tax on the property
of the Union. Since the immunity is confined to property vested
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 923
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
in the Union, the same cannot be claimed by entities other than
the Union. In order to ascertain this aspect i.e., whether the
statutory corporation or other entities do not come within the
scope and the ambit of Article 285, the doctrine of “piercing the
veil” may be pressed into service. Thus, Article 285 would not
apply when the property to be taxed is not of Union of India but
of a distinct and separate legal entity. Thus, the State cannot
levy road tax on the vehicles owned by the Central Government
or the Railway, which is a Ministry of the Union Government.
21.6 In Union of India vs. City Municipal Council, Bellary, AIR
1978 SC 1803 (“City Municipal Council”), it was observed
that the property of the Union is exempt from all taxes imposed
by the State or by any authority within the State under Article
285(1), unless the claim can be supported and sustained within
the parameters of Article 285 (2). The expression “save in so
far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide” in clause
(1) of Article 285 is to enable the Parliament to control Union
property. Thus, the Parliament may by law permit a State or
any authority or instrumentality within a State to impose tax on
Union property. But if no such law is made by the Parliament
the immunity would continue. Similarly, clause (2) of Article 285
which is in the nature of an exception to clause (1) thereof,
has given an overriding power to Parliament to take away any
existing taxation of a State or a local authority of Union property
prior to the commencement of the Constitution and which has
continued to be levied in the State even after the enforcement
thereof. In City Municipal Council, question arose whether the
Railway (Local Authorities Taxation) Act, 1941 which created
a liability on the Railways to taxation by local authorities was
contrary to Article 285 (1) of the Constitution. It was held that
the aforesaid Act being enacted prior to the enforcement of
the Constitution was not a law which came within the scope
of the expression “save in so far as Parliament may by law
otherwise provide” in clause (1) of Article 285. Hence, it was
observed that the said law could not be enforced after the
enforcement of the Constitution, and the Railway property
was immune from State taxation.
21.7 As already noted, clause (2) of Article 285 is in the nature
of an exception or a proviso to clause (1) of the said Article.
924 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
However, it empowers Parliament to restrict the exception. In
other words, any local taxes on Union property which were
saved by virtue of clause (2) of Article 285 shall cease to
be valid as soon as the Parliament by law provides to that
effect. This implies that clause (2) of Article 285 which saves
the existing power of the State and the local lawful bodies to
tax Union property would continue and the status quo would
be maintained till Parliament would legislate otherwise. In
clause (2) of Article 285, the expression “liable or treated as
liable” is of significance. The conditions necessary to bring
a property within clause (2) of Article 285 in order to make it
liable to taxation are as under:
""(a) Physical existence of the property immediately before
the commencement of the Constitution;
(b) Liability of the property to the tax on that date;
(c) Physical existence of the property now, i.e., at the time
when the tax is sought to be levied;
(d) Liability of the property to tax now;
(e) The tax in question must be the ‘same tax’ as that
which was levied or leviable at the commencement of
the Constitution;
(f) The local authority seeking to levy the tax must be in
the same State to which the pre-Constitution authority
belonged.”
[Source: Shorter Constitution of India by D.D. Basu, 16th Edition]
21.8 The aforesaid conditions would mean that the nature, type
and the property on which the tax is being levied prior to the
commencement of the Constitution must be the same, as also
the local authority of the same State to which it belongs before
the commencement of the Constitution. If the conditions of
clause (2) of Article 285 are not satisfied, the pre-Constitution
tax cannot be continued to be levied by a State by virtue of
Article 372(1) as the latter Article states that the continuance
of the existing law would be ‘subject to the other provisions
of the Constitution’. Hence, any law which is inconsistent with
Article 285 cannot be continued by virtue of Article 372(1) of
the Constitution.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 925
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
21.9 The expression “immediately before the commencement of
this Constitution” under clause (2) of Article 285 would mean
that the property is liable or treated as liable to tax until the
Union Parliament legislates to the contrary. One of the ways
of interpreting this is that the property must have been liable
to taxation even under the Government of India Act, 1935 in
as much as if any property was not liable to be taxed under
the said Act, in other words, if there was an immunity during
the enforcement of the said Act then it would not have been
taxed from the date of enforcement of the Constitution. It is
also necessary to understand the meaning of expression
“that tax” in clause (2) of Article 285 which would have a
relation to its nature and character and not its quantum or
rates. So long as the taxes remains the same, the State
or local authority can always increase or reduce its rate, in
accordance with law. The variation of the quantum or rate
would not affect its power to continue to levy the tax so long
as it remains “that tax,” in its nature and character. Thus, if
the tax remains the same, it is only the Parliament which can
prevent the continuance of levy of that tax by the State or
local authority or by any law. This Court in City Municipal
Council held that it does not matter whether the liability is
imposed by one statute or other as long as liability is of a
particular kind of tax.
21.10 Section 172 of the Act of 1959 categorically states that subject
to Article 285 of the Constitution, the corporation shall impose,
inter alia, property taxes assessed and levied in accordance
with the provisions of the Act of 1959 and the rules and bye-
laws framed thereunder. Sub-section (4) of Section 172 of
the Act of 1959 states that nothing in the said sub-section
shall authorize the imposition of any tax which the State
Legislature has no power to impose in the State under the
Constitution of India provided that where any tax was being
lawfully levied in the area included in the city immediately
before the commencement of the Constitution of India, such
tax may continue to be levied and applied for the purposes
of the Act of 1959 until provision to the contrary is made by
Parliament. Section 172, in fact, summarises Article 285 of the
Constitution in the context of levy of property taxes imposed
926 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
under the said Act by the Corporation. Section 173 deals
with property tax leviable which is again subject to Section
172(1) of the Act of 1959. It includes a general tax, a water
tax, drainage tax and conservancy tax. The said taxes shall
be levied on the annual value of the building and land, as
the case may be. However, the aggregate of the property
taxes shall in no cases be less than 15 per cent nor more
than 25 per cent of the annual value of the building or land or
both assessed to such taxes. The definition of annual value
is given under Section 174 of the Act of 1959. Restrictions
on imposition of water tax are delineated under Section 175
while the primary responsibility for certain property taxes
on annual value is stated in Section 179. It states that the
property tax shall be leviable primarily from the actual occupier
of the property upon which the tax is assessed, if he is the
owner of the buildings or lands or holds them on a building
or other lease from the Central or the State Government
or from the Corporation, or on a building leased from any
person. In any other case, tax shall be leviable as per sub-
section (2) of Section 179 of the Act of 1959. The drainage
taxes are assessed. Therefore, the levy of property taxes
or other taxes on land and building is subject to Article 285
of the Constitution.
21.11 We have already discussed the scope and ambit of the two
clauses of Article 285 of the Constitution. Applying the same
to the present case and having regard to the reasoning given
by us in the earlier part of this judgment, we have held that
enemy property is not the property of the Union although
it may vest with the Custodian for Enemy Property in India
who is a person appointed by the Central Government. If the
enemy property is not the Union property in terms of clause
(1) of Article 285 of the Constitution then such property
cannot be exempt from the taxes imposed by the State or
by any authority within the State unless otherwise provided
by the Parliament.
21.12 For the sake of completeness of the discussion assuming
for a moment that the vesting of the enemy property with
the Custodian becomes the property of the Union, then
clause (2) of Article 285 would apply in the instant case.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 927
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
This is because an authority within the State is not prevented
from levying any tax on any property of the Union to which
such property was immediately before the commencement
of the Constitution was liable or treated as liable so long
as that tax continued to be levied in that State. Applying
the same to the facts of the present case, it is noted that
the property in question which is located in Lucknow within
the State of Uttar Pradesh and in respect of which the Act
of 1959 applies was earlier governed by the Act of 1916.
On a perusal of the relevant provisions of the Act of 1916,
it becomes clear that the property tax was leviable on the
subject property. Act of 1916 is a pre-Constitution enactment
and therefore immediately before the commencement of the
Constitution, the subject property was liable to property tax
under the Act of 1916 and therefore until the Parliament by
law provides otherwise, the appellant corporation can continue
to levy municipal taxes including the property tax on the
subject property as it was liable to pay such tax prior to the
commencement of the Constitution under the provisions of
1916 Act. For ease of reference, the relevant provisions of the
1916 Act are also extracted above. Therefore, even as per
the provisions of clause (2) of Article 285 even if the subject
property is assumed to be Union property under clause (2)
of Article 285, the appellant-Corporation is entitled to levy the
property tax and the municipal tax on the said property even
though, it vests with the Custodian under the provisions of
the Act. That is why under Section 8 of the Act, Custodian
is duty bound to pay the taxes, duties, cesses and rates to
the municipal authority.
We wish to also make another observation. Since the year
1968, there have been lakhs of Indians who have settled
overseas without giving up their Indian citizenship. They have
acquired several movable and immovable properties in India.
If, in an unforeseen eventuality, any of the countries in which
such Indians are settled, is declared to be an enemy country
then all such Indians who are settled abroad would possibly
become enemy subjects, enemy firms and enemy companies
within the definition of the Act. In such an event, the Custodian
will have to take possession of such properties. Vesting of
928 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
such enemy properties in the Custodian is thus only for the
purpose of administration and management of such properties.
In view of our discussion made above, there would be no
transfer of ownership and such properties vest in the Custodian
for their protection and management only. By such vesting,
the Union cannot usurp ownership of such properties. In the
same vein, when many persons who are resident in India left
their properties and settled in enemy countries, the Custodian
has taken possession of such properties which is only for the
purpose of protection and maintenance and to be handed
over as and when a conducive environment between the
countries arises.
We also observe that it was never the intention under the
Defence of India Rules, 1962 and 1971 or under the provisions
of the Act that enemy subjects would lose all their right, title
and interest in the properties once the said properties vest in
the Custodian and thereby become Union properties. In this
regard, we also would like to emphasise that the expression
“vest in the Union” is clearly mentioned in Article 296 of the
Constitution. The said provision deals with properties which
for want of a rightful owner or as bona vacantia would vest
in a State if the property is in a State or vest in the Union
in any other case. The Constitution has therefore clearly
differentiated between vesting of properties in the Union or a
State which is totally distinct from vesting of enemy properties
in the Custodian for Enemy Property.
It is reiterated that the Custodian who is appointed under the
provisions of the Act by the Central Government discharges
his duties and carries out his functions under the provisions of
the Act in terms of the directions of the Central Government.
This is because the Act is a piece of Parliamentary legislation
and in order to achieve a uniform policy vis-à-vis management
and administration of enemy properties throughout the length
and breadth of the country. It, therefore, cannot be held that
the properties vest with the Union within the meaning of Article
285 of the Constitution. In our view, the said Article has no
application to enemy properties.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 929
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
22. In Amir Mohammad Khan case, the father of the respondent therein
was a Raja, who had migrated to Pakistan in 1957 and became
a citizen of that country. However, the respondent therein and his
mother (since deceased) continued to reside in India as Indian
citizen. Under the provisions of the Enemy Property (Custody and
Registration) Order, 1965, the property of the respondent’s father in
India vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property. After the enactment
of the Act under consideration, by virtue of Section 24 thereof, the
property continued to be vested in the Custodian. In 1973, the Raja
died in London. The respondent then sought the Government of India
and the Custodian to release that property as the same stood vested
in him as an Indian citizen. In 1981, the Government of India agreed
to release 25% of the property to the legal heirs and successors
of the late Raja in India and the Custodian of the Enemy Property
asked the respondent for legal evidence regarding such heirs and
successors. In 1986, at the instance of the respondent, the civil
court declared that the respondent was the sole heir and successor
of his father and thereby entitled to 25% or whatever percentage it
might be of the suit property. The said judgment became final. Since,
the properties were not handed over to the respondent, he filed a
writ petition before the Bombay High Court which was allowed by
directing that the possession of the properties should be handed
over to the respondent. The Union of India filed an appeal before
this Court by way of a Special Leave. Dismissing the appeal, this
Court held that the Act was enacted for the purpose of continued
vesting of enemy property in the Custodian of Enemy Property for
India under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 and the Defence of
India Rules, 1971.
22.1 This Court observed that the respondent therein was the sole
heir and successor of the late Raja and properties belonging to
the late Raja was succeeded to by the respondent by way of
succession and the properties in question could no longer be
enemy property within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act.
Therefore, the Custodian could not be permitted to continue
in possession of such properties. During the pendency of the
Writ Petition before it, the High Court directed the appellant
therein to place on record a copy of the note put up for release
of the property of the respondent’s father and the decision
taken thereon by the Cabinet.
930 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
22.2 The Union of India was directed by this Court to get the
buildings (residence or offices) of the subject property vacated
from such officers and hand over the possession to the
respondent therein within eight weeks. While holding so, this
Court observed that on a conjoint reading of Sections 6, 8 and
18 of the Act, the enemy subject is not divested of his right,
title and interest of the property which vest in the Custodian is
limited to the extent of possession, management and control
over the property temporarily. The object of the Act was to
prevent a subject of an enemy State from carrying on business
and trading in the property situated in India. It is, therefore,
contemplated that temporary vesting of the property takes
place in the Custodian so that the property till such time, as
it is enemy property, cannot be used for such purpose. The
question considered was, whether, after the inheritance of the
property by the respondent therein who was a citizen of India,
upon the death of the original owner of the property who was
declared to be an enemy, the property continued to be enemy
property? It was answered in the negative. It was observed
that the definition of enemy provided under Section 2 (b) of
the Act excluded a citizen of India as an enemy or enemy
subject or an enemy firm. Therefore, the respondent herein
who was born in India and his Indian citizenship not being
in question could not by any stretch of imagination be held
to be enemy or enemy subject under Section 2(b). Similarly,
under Section 2(c) the property belonging to enemy could not
be termed as an enemy property.
22.3 It was further observed that after the death of the enemy, the
right, title and interest of the enemy was succeeded to by his
heirs who are Indian citizens. Therefore, the enemy property
would cease to be a property belonging of the enemy, hence
the Custodian could not be permitted to continue with the
possession of such property. In this regard, it was observed
that the reliance placed by the Union of India on Section 13
of the Act was totally misplaced. That in the said case this
Court noted that Union of India - appellant therein had agreed
to release 25% of the property in favour of the respondent
therein on production of proof of his having succeeded to the
property of his father. That the property of an enemy could
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 931
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
be released in favour of an Indian citizen provided he had
succeeded to the estate of the deceased enemy subject. That
the title of the enemy property did not vest with the Custodian
but the property vested in the Custodian for the purposes of
management, control and possession of the properties only.
In the said case, Union of India had admitted that under the
provision of the Act, title of the property of an enemy does
not vest in the Custodian but the Custodian takes over the
enemy property only for the purpose of possession, control
and management. That an Indian citizen is excluded from the
definition of an “enemy” or “enemy subject” under Section
2(b) of the Act. That on the death of the enemy subject, his
successors and legal heirs being Indian citizens were entitled
to succeed to the subject property as it ceased to be an
enemy property. That even though a decision was taken to
release only 25% of the property to the respondent therein,
the same was also not implemented, for over three decades.
Therefore, the direction was issued to the appellant-Union
of India therein to get the buildings (residence or offices)
vacated from such officers and hand over the possession to
the respondent therein within eight weeks. The appeal of the
Union of India was dismissed with costs of Rs.5 lakhs. This
decision was rendered on 21.10.2005.
22.4 Thereafter, on 08.09.2006 in the case of Kohli Brothers
vs. Amir Mohammad Khan, (2012) 12 SCC 625 (“Kohli
Brothers”), this Court disposed of certain Special Leave
Petitions with the clarification that persons who were inducted/
allotted properties by the Custodian or who came in possession
after 1965 i.e. on or after declaring the property of the Raja
of Mahmudabad as enemy property and appointment of the
Custodian, had to vacate the properties in their possession.
But persons claiming possession prior to the appointment of
the Custodian declaring the property of Raja of Mahmudabad,
father of the respondent therein, as enemy property, based
on duly authenticated tenancy created by the then Raja of
Mahmudabad or his general power of attorney was not to be
covered by this Court’s judgment passed in Amir Mohammad
Khan.
932 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
In this regard, it would be useful to reiterate the statement
and objects of the Act wherein it has been stated that
immovable property, cash balances and firms belonging to
Chinese nationals in India were vested in the Custodian of
Enemy Property for India appointed under the Defence of
India Rules, 1962. Similarly, upon the aggression by Pakistan
in 1965, enemy properties were vested in the Custodian of
Enemy Property under the power derived from the Defence
of India Rules, 1962. That the properties vested in the
Custodian of Enemy Property in India has to continue as it
has not been possible for the Government of India so far to
arrive at a settlement with the respective Governments of
those countries.
On a perusal of the impugned order, it is noted that the
learned counsel appearing for the appellant-Lucknow Nagar
Nigam had submitted before the High Court that the Nagar
Nigam may not charge in respect of property of Central
Government but may demand fee, if any, with respect to
services provided like water charge or sewerage charge. The
present case relates to house tax and water tax. The High
Court construed the said submission as an admission of the
fact that the subject property is the Central Government’s
property and therefore, quashed the recovery sought to be
made by the appellant-Nagar Nigam. In fact, the submission
of the learned counsel for the appellant-Nagar Nigam has to
be construed in the context of the provisions of the Act as
well as the relevant provisions of the Constitution which we
have now interpreted.
Therefore, whatever amount have already been deposited
by the respondent herein, the same shall not be refunded to
them. But, if no other demand has been made till date, such
demand shall not be made. However, from the current fiscal
year onwards (2024-2025), the appellant shall be entitled to
levy and collect the property tax as well as water tax and
sewerage charges and any other local taxes in accordance
with law. We have granted a relaxation to the respondent in
view of the fact that the High Court by the impugned order
dated 29.03.2017, had held in favour of the respondent herein
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 933
Lucknow Nagar Nigam & Others v. Kohli Brothers Colour Lab.
Pvt. Ltd. & Others
and we are now reversing the said order.
In view of the aforesaid discussion, we arrive at the following
conclusions:
1) That the Custodian for Enemy Property in India, in whom
the enemy properties vest including the subject property,
does not acquire ownership of the said properties. The
enemy properties vest in the Custodian as a trustee
only for the management and administration of such
properties.
2) That the Central Government may, on a reference or
complaint or on its own motion initiate a process of
divestment of enemy property vested in the Custodian to
the owner thereof or to such other person vide Rule 15
of the Rules. Hence, the vesting of the enemy property
in the Custodian is only as a temporary measure and
he acts as a trustee of the said properties.
3) That in view of the above conclusion, Union of India
cannot assume ownership of the enemy properties
once the said property is vested in the Custodian. This
is because, there is no transfer of ownership from the
owner of the enemy property to the Custodian and
consequently, there is no ownership rights transferred
to the Union of India. Therefore, the enemy properties
which vest in the Custodian are not Union properties.
4) As the enemy properties are not Union properties, clause
(1) of Article 285 does not apply to enemy properties.
Clause (2) of Article 285 is an exception to clause (1)
and would apply only if the enemy properties are Union
properties and not otherwise.
5) In view of the above, the High Court was not right in
holding that the respondent as occupier of the subject
property, is not liable to pay any property tax or other
local taxes to the appellant. In the result, the impugned
order of the High Court dated 29.03.2017 passed in Misc.
Bench No.2317 of 2012 is liable to be set aside and is
accordingly set aside.
934 [2024] 2 S.C.R.

6) Consequently, any demand for payment of taxes under
the Act of 1959 made and thereby paid by the respondent
to the appellant-authority shall not be refunded. However,
if no demand notices have been issued till date, the
same shall not be issued but from the current fiscal year
onwards (2024-2025), the appellant shall be entitled to
levy and collect the property tax as well as water tax
and sewerage charges and any other local taxes in
accordance with law.
In the result, the appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms.

","Order
1. The appellant-landlady is aggrieved by the judgment dated 30th July,
2015 passed by the Division Bench1 as also the order dated 09th
January, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge in a writ petition2
filed before the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur
Bench, preferred by her under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
2. The facts of the case reveal that the appellant-owner of a commercial
premises at Vashistha Marg, Raja Park, Jaipur had leased out a part
of the said premises3 to the respondent-Bank for a period of nine
years in terms of the lease agreement dated 13th October, 2000,
executed between the parties. The relevant clauses of the said lease
agreement are reproduced hereinbelow :
“LESSEE’S COVENANTS:
2 (j) On the expiry of the said period of the lease or any
renewal thereof, the Lessee shall deliver the demised
premises in such order and condition as in consistent with
the terms, covenants and conditions on the part of the
Lessee herein contained (save and except damage to the
demised premises by the fire unless the fire has occurred
due to negligence of the Lessee), riots, earthquake, storm,
war, civil commotion, acts of God and other conditions
over which the Lessee shall have no control) SUBJECT
ALWAYS to what is stated hereinafter.
ASSIGNMENT/TERMINATION/RENEWAL
6 (a) The Lessee shall be entitle to assign or sub-let
or otherwise allow use and occupation of the demised
premises or any part thereof to its business associates,
affiliate companies but not beyond the tenure of this lease
or renewal thereof (if any) , as mentioned hereunder.
(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, the Lessee
shall always be entitled, without assigning any reason, to

Mahendra Kaur Arora v. HDFC Bank Ltd
terminate this lease at any time before the expiry of the
tenure of this lease or any renewal period (if any) thereof,
by giving to the Lessor three months’ prior notice in writing.”
3. In terms of the lease agreement, the agreed monthly rent of the
premises was fixed at ₹28,625/- (Rupees Twenty eight thousand
six hundred twenty five only). Vide letter dated 10th May, 2004, the
respondent-Bank terminated the lease agreement by issuing a three
months’ notice in terms of clause 6 thereof. The said notice period
was made effective from 16th August, 2004.
4. It is the version of the appellant-landlady that the respondent-Bank
did not hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the leased
premises to her and instead, continued occupying the subject
premises upto 18th June, 2006, when the keys were finally handed
over to her. It is also the stand of the appellant-landlady that the
respondent-Bank did not pay her the use and occupation charges
in respect of the subject premises from 16th August, 2004 till 20th
February, 2006, after adjusting the security deposit of ₹85,875/-
(Rupees Eighty five thousand eight hundred seventy five only)
towards the rent payable for three months.
5. Aggrieved by the non-payment of rent by the respondent-Bank, the
appellant filed an application before the Rent Tribunal, Jaipur City,
Jaipur on 20th February, 2006 seeking eviction and recovery of the
arrears of rent. It was after institution of the aforesaid petition by the
appellant-landlady that the respondent-Bank handed over the keys of
the premises to her before the Presiding Officer of the Rent Control
Tribunal on 18th June, 2006. The petition filed by the appellant-
landlady was contested to the hilt by the respondent-Bank who also
filed a counter claim seeking refund of the security amount along with
interest @ 24% per annum compounded quarterly, w.e.f. 17th August,
2004, till realization. Vide judgment dated 10th April, 2008, the rent
application filed by the appellant-landlady was decreed in her favour
and the counter claim filed by the respondent-Bank was rejected.
6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision, the respondent-Bank filed an
appeal before the Appellate Rent Tribunal which was allowed vide
order dated 05th March, 2009. As a consequence thereof, the decree
passed in favour of the appellant-landlady was set aside and the
counter claim filed by the respondent-Bank was allowed. The said
order was challenged by the appellant-landlady by filing a petition
284 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India before the High Court
which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide order dated
09th January, 2012. Instead of approaching this Court for relief against
the said order, the appellant filed a misconceived intra court appeal
that has been dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court as
not maintainable vide order dated 30th July, 2015. Both the orders
are under appeal before us.
7. Ms. Shobha Gupta, learned Senior counsel appearing for the
appellant-landlady submits that the learned Single Judge has erred in
upholding the order passed by the Appellate Rent Tribunal whereby
the decree passed in favour of the appellant-landlady was set aside
inasmuch as the Court failed to appreciate the fact that the notice
dated 10th May, 2004 issued by the respondent-Bank referred to its
proposal to handover possession of the subject premises on 16th
August, 2004. It is urged that the security deposit could have been
refunded to the respondent-Bank contemporaneous to handing over
vacant and peaceful possession of the premises to the appellant-
landlord, which in the instant case was not done. It is therefore,
submitted that the obligation cast on the appellant-landlady to refund
the security amount in terms of the lease agreement did not arise till
the respondent-Bank actually vacated the subject premises which
admittedly remain in its possession till 18th June, 2006.
8. Per contra, Mr. Sandeep P. Agarwal, learned Senior counsel appearing
for the respondent-Bank seeks to rely on the terms and conditions
of the lease agreement and, in particular clauses of the Deposit
Agreement dated 13th October, 2000. Clauses 6 and 8 of the Deposit
Agreement read as follows :
“6. It is agreed by and between the parties hereto that on
the said Lease Agreement of any renewal thereof expiring
by efflux of time or coming to an end for any reason
whatsoever as provided in the said Lease Agreement
the Lessor shall refund (without any deduction on any
account and without interest) the said deposit to the
Lessee simultaneously with the Lessee removing itself/ its
officers / employees using the leased premises from and
vacating the leased premises and giving charge thereof
to the Lessor (reasonable wear and tear, damages/ Loss
to / destruction of the leased premises by fire not caused
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 285
Mahendra Kaur Arora v. HDFC Bank Ltd
by the willful neglect on the part of the Lessee, its officers
/employees using the leased premises, Civil commotion,
riots, air attack, act of God and anything else beyond the
control of the Lessee excepted).”
8. In the event the Lessor does not refund the said
deposit to the Lessee in full, at the time of the said Lease
Agreement or any renewal thereof comes to an end, as
aforesaid, then the consequences mentioned in para nos.
i) to iii) hereunder shall follow:
i) The Lessee shall (without prejudice to its rights
and remedies in law) , not be obliged or bound to
vacate and give charge of the leased premises to
the Lessor and the Lessee shall be entitled to use
or permit, the leased premises to be used by any
person of its choice without being liable to pay any
rent, outgoings or damages to the Lessor until such
time as the Lessor does not refund to the Lessee
the said deposit in full ; and
ii) In addition, the Lessor shall be liable to pay to the
Lessee interest @ 24% p. a. compounded quarterly,
on the said deposit from the date of termination or
expiry of the said Lessee Agreement or any renewal
thereof till the date of refund of the said deposit by
the Lessor to the Lessee; and
iii) In the event the Lessor is unable to return the deposit
as aforesaid for a period of 30 days from the date it
becomes due, the Lessee shall be liberty to further
sub- let the leased premises for period of not less than
12 months at a time on such terms and conditions
as the Lessee may in its absolute discretion may
deem fit”
9. It is the stand of the respondent-Bank that in terms of the aforesaid
clauses of the Deposit Agreement, the appellant-landlady was under
an obligation to refund the security deposit to the respondent-Bank
at the time of handing over vacant and peaceful possession of the
leased premises, which she failed to do and therefore, the aforesaid
clauses entitle the respondent-Bank to continue using the leased
286 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
premises itself or by any other person of its choice without any
liability to pay any rent/outgoings/damages.
10. We are afraid, the aforesaid argument advanced by learned counsel for
the respondent-Bank is not persuasive. The language of Clause 6 of
the Deposit Agreement makes it abundantly clear that the respondent-
Bank was liable to refund the deposit amount contemporaneous
to the Bank removing itself from the leased premises and handing
over vacant possession thereof to the appellant-landlady and giving
charge thereof to her, which procedure in the instant case, had not
been followed. There is nothing on record to demonstrate that any
steps were taken by the respondent-Bank calling upon the appellant-
landlady to remain present at the subject premises for purposes of
handing over/taking over possession of the leased premises on a
particular date and time and giving charge thereof to her for her to
refund the security deposit simultaneously to the respondent-Bank.
11. For the aforesaid reasons, we are unable to sustain the impugned
order dated 09th January, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge
that has upheld the order dated 05th March, 2009, passed by the
Appellate Rent Tribunal, Jaipur. However, the order dated 30th July,
2015 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is maintained
for the reason that no intra-court appeal could have been preferred
by the appellant-Landlady against an order passed by the learned
Single Judge on a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution
of India. As a result, Civil Appeal No. 6096 of 2017 is allowed, the
judgment dated 10th April, 2008 passed by the Rent Tribunal is
restored and the decree passed in favour of the appellant-landlady
is upheld. Civil Appeal No. 6097 of 2017 is however dismissed as
there is no error in the finding returned by the Division Bench of the
High Court regarding maintainability of an appeal against the order
dated 09th January, 2012, passed in proceedings under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. Parties are left to bear their own expenses.

Respondent submitted its Techno Commercial Bid. The contract for
the construction of weir was awarded to the Respondent whereafter
due to certain disputes, the Respondent issued a notice in terms
of Clause 3.34 of Section III Volume II of the Tender Documents
invoking arbitration and further seeking consent of the appellant
for the appointment of a former Judge of a High Court, as Sole
Arbitrator. The Respondent, while invoking the arbitration, had
taken recourse to Clause 2 of the Letter of Intent (L.O.I.) issued
by the Appellant while awarding the contract. Clause 2 stated thus:
“All terms and conditions as contained in the tender issued by
DVC to NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis except where these
have been expressly modified by NBCC.” Since the Appellant did
not respond to the notice, the Respondent approached the High
Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996. High Court allowed the petition preferred by the Respondent.
Held: A perusal of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act
itself would reveal that before an arbitration clause could be read
as a part of the contract, there must be a conscious acceptance of
the arbitration clause from another document by the parties – It is
thus clear that a reference to the document in the contract should
be such that shows the intention to incorporate the arbitration clause
contained in the document into the contract. [Paras 12 and 13]
While setting aside the order of the High Court, the Supreme
Court held that a general reference to the terms and conditions
of another contract would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause – It is pertinent to note that clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I. specifically uses the word “Only” before the words “be
through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone” – When
there is a reference in the second contract to the terms and
conditions of the first contract, the arbitration clause would not
ipso facto be applicable to the second contract unless there is
specific mention/reference thereto – The present case is not a
case of ‘incorporation’ but a case of ‘reference’ – As such, a
general reference would not have the effect of incorporating the
arbitration clause – Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I, which is also a part
of the agreement, makes it amply clear that the redressal of the
dispute between NBCC and respondent has to be only through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone – Delhi High Court
has erred in allowing the application of the respondent. [Paras

2021 and final judgment & order dated 9th April 2021, passed by the
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 815
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi (hereinafter, “High
Court”), in Arbitration Petition (Arb. P.) No. 44 of 2021, whereby
the High Court allowed the application under Section 11(6) of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 (hereinafter referred to as, “the
Arbitration Act”) and appointed the Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the
dispute between the parties to the present lis, arising from the Letter
of Intent dated 4th December 2006.
3. Facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeals are as follows:
3.1 The appellant, NBCC (India) Limited (Formerly known as
National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd.), is a Public
Limited Company and Government of India undertaking,
engaged in construction of power plants and other infrastructure
projects on EPC and/or PMC basis.
3.2 The respondent, M/s Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly
known as Durha Constructions Pvt. Ltd.), is a Private Limited
Company, engaged in the construction and infrastructure
sector.
3.3 The appellant issued an invitation for tender, being NIT No.
01-WEIR/06 dated 3rd November 2006, for “Construction of
Weir with Allied Structures across river Damodar at DVC,
CTPS, Chandrapura, Dist – Bokaro, Jharkhand – Package
“A” (hereinafter referred to as, “Construction of the Weir”),
containing inter-alia, the General Conditions of Contract,
Special Conditions of Contract, Bill of Quantity, etc. (collectively
referred to as, “Tender Documents”).
3.4 In response to the aforementioned tender, the Respondent
submitted its Techno Commercial Bid on 16th November 2006.
3.5 On fulfilment of the tender criteria, vide Letter of Intent
No. AGM/RAN/CTPS-AWARD/06/1660 dated 4th December
2006, the appellant awarded the contract for Construction
of the Weir to the respondent for a total value of Rs.
19,08,46,612/-.
3.6 With the passage of time, certain disputes arose between
the parties to the present lis & as a result, the respondent
issued a notice dated 6th March 2020, in terms of Clause
3.34 of Section III Volume II of the Tender Documents (GCC),
816 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
thereby invoking arbitration and further seeking consent of
the appellant for the appointment of a former Judge of a High
Court, as Sole Arbitrator.
3.7 The appellant did not respond to the aforementioned notice
invoking arbitration, so the respondent filed an application
at the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act.
3.8 Vide interim order dated 12th March 2021, the High Court
allowed the Arbitration Petition and proposed the appointment
of a former Judge of the High Court, as the Sole Arbitrator, to
adjudicate the dispute between the parties.
3.9 Vide final judgment & order dated 9th April 2021, the High Court
confirmed the proposed appointment of the former Judge of
the Delhi High Court, as the Sole Arbitrator.
3.10 Aggrieved by the orders of the learned single judge of the
High Court, the appellant filed the present appeals thereby
challenging both the interim order and the final judgement &
order.
3.11 This Court vide order dated 23rd July, 2021, issued notice and
stay of further proceedings of the arbitration was granted.
4. We have heard Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant & Shri Sumit Kumar,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.
5. Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the appellant submits that the High Court has grossly erred in invoking
its power under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that
Clause 2.0 of the Letter of Intent dated 4th December 2006 (“L.O.I.”
for short) though states that all terms and conditions as contained
in the tender issued by the Damodar Valley Corporation (“DVC” for
short) to the NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis, it also makes it clear
that where the terms and conditions have been expressly modified
by the NBCC, the same would not be applicable. It is submitted that
Clause 1.0 of the L.O.I. specifically states that various conditions,
i.e., contractual, financial and technical mentioned in the documents
contained therein shall be binding on the respondent for execution
of works and they shall form part of the agreement. Clause 10.0
also states that the L.O.I. shall also form a part of the agreement.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 817
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
It is submitted that the intention is amply clear from Clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I., which states that the redressal of dispute between the
NBCC and the respondent shall only be through civil courts having
jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It further states that the laws applicable
to the contract between the parties shall be the laws enforceable in
India. It is submitted that merely on account of reference in the L.O.I.
to the terms and conditions as contained in the tender issued by the
DVC to the NBCC, Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms & Conditions
of Contract would not apply in view of specific modification as stated
in Clause 2.0 of the L.O.I.
6. Learned Senior Counsel submits that a mere reference to the
terms and conditions without there being an incorporation in the
L.O.I. would not make the lis between the parties amenable to the
arbitration proceedings. Relying on the judgment of this Court in
the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private Limited
vs. Som Datt Builders Limited1, he submits that unless the L.O.I.
specifically provides for incorporation of the arbitration clause, a
reference to the arbitration proceedings would not be permitted
in view of the provisions of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the
Arbitration Act.
7. Shri Sumit Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent,
on the contrary, submits that there is a specific reference in Clause
2.0 of the L.O.I. to the terms and conditions in the tender issued by
the DVC to the NBCC. He submits that the only modification is that
under Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms & Conditions of Contract,
the jurisdiction is vested with the Court in the City of Kolkata only,
whereas in the L.O.I. the jurisdiction would be vested in the civil
courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It is submitted that the
learned single judge of the Delhi High Court has rightly considered
this aspect and as such, no interference would be warranted in the
impugned order.
8. Sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act reads thus:
“7. Arbitration Agreement.-1)……………….
xxx xxx xxx
1 (2009) 7 SCC 696
818 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(5) The reference in a contract to a document containing
an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement
if the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to
make that arbitration clause part of the contract.”
9. The issue is no more res integra. The provisions of sub-section (5)
of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act have been considered by this
Court in the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private
Limited (supra). After considering the relevant passages from
Russell on Arbitration and various English judgments, this Court
held thus:
“24. The scope and intent of Section 7(5) of the Act may
therefore be summarised thus:
(i) An arbitration clause in another document, would
get incorporated into a contract by reference, if the
following conditions are fulfilled:
(1) the contract should contain a clear reference
to the documents containing arbitration clause,
(2) the reference to the other document should
clearly indicate an intention to incorporate the
arbitration clause into the contract,
(3) the arbitration clause should be appropriate, that
is capable of application in respect of disputes
under the contract and should not be repugnant
to any term of the contract.
(ii) When the parties enter into a contract, making a
general reference to another contract, such general
reference would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause from the referred document
into the contract between the parties. The arbitration
clause from another contract can be incorporated into
the contract (where such reference is made), only by
a specific reference to arbitration clause.
(iii) Where a contract between the parties provides that
the execution or performance of that contract shall
be in terms of another contract (which contains the
terms and conditions relating to performance and a
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 819
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
provision for settlement of disputes by arbitration),
then, the terms of the referred contract in regard
to execution/performance alone will apply, and not
the arbitration agreement in the referred contract,
unless there is special reference to the arbitration
clause also.
(iv) Where the contract provides that the standard form
of terms and conditions of an independent trade or
professional institution (as for example the standard
terms and conditions of a trade association or
architects association) will bind them or apply to the
contract, such standard form of terms and conditions
including any provision for arbitration in such
standard terms and conditions, shall be deemed to
be incorporated by reference. Sometimes the contract
may also say that the parties are familiar with those
terms and conditions or that the parties have read
and understood the said terms and conditions.
(v) Where the contract between the parties stipulates
that the conditions of contract of one of the parties
to the contract shall form a part of their contract (as
for example the general conditions of contract of
the Government where the Government is a party),
the arbitration clause forming part of such general
conditions of contract will apply to the contract
between the parties.”
10. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that when the parties
enter into a contract, making a general reference to another contract,
such general reference would not have the effect of incorporating
the arbitration clause from the referred document into the contract
between the parties. It has been held that the arbitration clause
from another contract can be incorporated into the contract (where
such reference is made), only by a specific reference to arbitration
clause. It has further been held that where a contract between the
parties provides that the execution or performance of that contract
shall be in terms of another contract (which contains the terms and
conditions relating to performance and a provision for settlement
of disputes by arbitration), then, the terms of the referred contract
820 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in regard to execution/performance alone will apply, and not the
arbitration agreement in the referred contract, unless there is special
reference to the arbitration clause also.
11. This Court further held that where the contract provides that the
standard form of terms and conditions of an independent trade or
professional institution will bind them or apply to the contract, such
standard form of terms and conditions including any provision for
arbitration in such standard terms and conditions, shall be deemed
to be incorporated by reference. It has been held that sometimes the
contract may also say that the parties are familiar with those terms
and conditions or that the parties have read and understood the said
terms and conditions. It has also been held that where the contract
between the parties stipulates that the conditions of contract of one
of the parties to the contract shall form a part of their contract, the
arbitration clause forming part of such general conditions of contract
will apply to the contract between the parties.
12. A perusal of sub-section (5) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act itself
would reveal that it provides for a conscious acceptance of the
arbitration clause from another document, by the parties, as a part
of their contract, before such arbitration clause could be read as a
part of the contract between the parties.
13. It is thus clear that a reference to the document in the contract should
be such that shows the intention to incorporate the arbitration clause
contained in the document into the contract.
14. The law laid down in the case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors
Private Limited (supra) has been followed by this Court in the
cases of Duro Felguera, S.A. vs Gangavaram Port Limited2
and Elite Engineering and Construction (Hyderabad) Private
Limited represented by its Managing Director vs Techtrans
Construction India Private Limited represented by its Managing
Director3.
15. No doubt that this Court in the case of Inox Wind Limited vs
Thermocables Limited4 has distinguished the law laid down in the
2 [2017] 10 SCR 285 : (2017) 9 SCC 729
3 [2018] 4 SCR 585 : (2018) 4 SCC 281
4 [2018] 1 SCR 86 : (2018) 2 SCC 519
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 821
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
case of M.R. Engineers and Contractors Private Limited (supra).
In the said case (i.e. Inox Wind Limited), this Court has held that
though general reference to an earlier contract is not sufficient for
incorporation of an arbitration clause in the later contract, a general
reference to a standard form would be enough for incorporation of
the arbitration clause. Though this Court in the case of Inox Wind
Limited (supra) agrees with the judgment in the case of M.R.
Engineers and Contractors Private Limited (supra), it holds that
general reference to a standard form of contract of one party along
with those of trade associations and professional bodies will be
sufficient to incorporate the arbitration clause. In the said case (i.e.
Inox Wind Limited), this Court found that the purchase order was
issued by the appellant therein in which it was categorically mentioned
that the supply would be as per the terms mentioned therein and in
the attached standard terms and conditions. The respondent therein
by his letter had confirmed its acceptance. This Court found that the
case before it was a case of a single-contract and not two-contract
case and, therefore, held that the arbitration clause as mentioned
in the terms and conditions would be applicable.
16. The present case is a ‘two-contract’ case and not a ‘single-contract’
case.
17. It will be relevant to refer to Clause 3.34 of the Additional Terms &
Conditions of Contract as contained in the tender issued by the DVC
to the NBCC. Clause 3.34 reads thus:
“3.34 SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES & ARBITRATION
Any dispute(s) or difference(s) arising out of or in connection
with the contract shall to the extent possible be settled
amicably between the owner and supplier/contractor.
In the event of any dispute or difference whatsoever arising
under the contract or in connection therewith including any
question relating to existence meaning and interpretation of
the contract or any alleged breach thereof the same shall
be referred to the sole arbitration of the Secretary, CEO
of Damodar Valley Corporation, Kolkata-54 or to a person
appointed by him for that purpose. The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of arbitration
and conciliation law 1996 and the decision/judgment of
Arbitrator shall be final and binding on both the parties.
822 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
All suits arising out of this enquiry and subsequent purchase
order, if any, are subject jurisdiction of court in the City of
Kolkata only and no other door when resolution/settlement
through mutual discussion and arbitration fails.”
18. No doubt that Clause 3.34 provides for a reference of the dispute
to the sole arbitration of the Secretary, CEO of Damodar Valley
Corporation, Kolkata-54 or to a person appointed by him for that
purpose.
19. It will also be apposite to refer to Clauses 1.0, 2.0, 7.0 and 10.0 of
the L.O.I., which read thus:
“1.0 The work shall be executed you on contractual,
financial and technical conditions of contract as
contained in the following documents which shall be
applicable and binding on you for execution of works
and shall form part of agreement with you as also
mentioned in the above mentioned NIT-01/WEIR/06
dated November 3, 2006.
(a) Notice Inviting Tender
(b) General Conditions of Contract
(c) Special Conditions of Contract
(d) Bill of Quantity
2.0 All terms and conditions as contained in the tender
issued by DVC to NBCC shall apply mutatis mutandis
except where these have been expressly modified
by NBCC.
7.0 The redressal of dispute between NBCC and you
shall only be through civil courts having jurisdiction
of Delhi alone. The laws applicable to this contract
shall be the laws enforceable in India.
10.0 This letter of intent shall also form a part of the
agreement.
20. In view of Clause 1.0, the documents stated therein shall also form
part of the agreement. In view of Clause 2.0, all terms and conditions
as contained in the tender issued by the DVC to the NBCC shall apply
mutatis mutandis except where these have been expressly modified
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 823
NBCC (India) Limited v. Zillion Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd.
by the NBCC. Clause 7.0 specifically provides that the redressal of
dispute between the NBCC and the respondent shall only be through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone. Clause 10.0 further
provides that the L.O.I. shall also form a part of the agreement.
21. It is thus clear that the intention between the parties is very clear.
Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I. which also forms part of the agreement
specifically provides that the redressal of the dispute between the
NBCC and the respondent shall only be through civil courts having
jurisdiction of Delhi alone. It is pertinent to note that Clause 7.0 of
the L.O.I. specifically uses the word “only” before the words “be
through civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone”.
22. As already discussed herein above, when there is a reference in the
second contract to the terms and conditions of the first contract, the
arbitration clause would not ipso facto be applicable to the second
contract unless there is a specific mention/reference thereto.
23. We are of the considered view that the present case is not a case of
‘incorporation’ but a case of ‘reference’. As such, a general reference
would not have the effect of incorporating the arbitration clause.
In any case, Clause 7.0 of the L.O.I., which is also a part of the
agreement, makes it amply clear that the redressal of the dispute
between the NBCC and the respondent has to be only through
civil courts having jurisdiction of Delhi alone.
24. In that view of the matter, we find that the learned single judge of
the Delhi High Court has erred in allowing the application of the
respondent. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The impugned
orders are quashed and set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
25. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

","Judgment
Abhay S. Oka, J.
1. These appeals take exception to the separate impugned judgments
and orders dated 7th October 2021 and 29th October 2021 passed
by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (for short, ‘the
218 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
NCLAT’). In Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022, the issue involved is
whether the first respondent is a financial creditor within the meaning
of sub-section (7) of Section 5 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy
Code, 2016 (for short, ‘the IBC’). The corporate debtor, in this case,
is M/s. Mount Shivalik Industries Limited. The impugned judgment
and order dated 7th October 2021 holds that the first respondent is a
financial creditor. As far as Civil Appeal nos.6991-6994 of 2022 are
concerned, the issue is whether the 1st to 4th respondents therein are
financial creditors of the same corporate debtor - M/s. Mount Shivalik
Industries Limited. The impugned judgment dated 29th October 2021
follows the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022.
FACTUAL ASPECTS
2. A brief reference to the factual aspects of Civil Appeal no.1143 of
2022 must be made to understand the controversy. There were
two agreements of 1st April 2014 and 1st April 2015 between the
corporate debtor and the first respondent. The agreements were
in the form of letters addressed by the corporate debtor to the
first respondent. By the agreement/letter dated 1st April 2014, the
corporate debtor appointed the first respondent as a ‘Sales Promoter’
to promote beer manufactured by the corporate debtor at Ranchi
(Jharkhand) for twelve months. One of the conditions incorporated
by the corporate debtor in the said letter/agreement was that the first
respondent should deposit a minimum security of Rs.53,15,000/- with
the corporate debtor, which will carry interest @21% per annum.
The letter provided that the corporate debtor will pay the interest on
Rs.7,85,850/- @21% per annum. The terms of the agreement/letter
dated 1st April 2015 are identical. The only difference is that under
the second agreement/letter, the corporate debtor was to pay the
interest on Rs.32,85,850/- @21% per annum.
3. The Oriental Bank of Commerce invoked the provisions of Section
7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor. The National Company
Law Tribunal (for short, ‘the NCLT’) admitted the application under
Section 7 of the IBC by the order dated 12th June 2018. It imposed
a moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC. The second respondent
was appointed as the Interim Resolution Professional. Initially, the
first respondent filed a claim with the second respondent as an
operational creditor. The claim was withdrawn, and on 19th September
2018, the first respondent filed a claim with the second respondent
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 219
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
as a financial creditor. By a communication dated 7th October 2018,
the second respondent informed the first respondent that the first
respondent’s claim was accepted partly as an operational debt and
partly as a financial debt. After the first respondent submitted Form-B,
the second respondent rejected the claim on the ground that the first
respondent could not be considered a financial creditor. Therefore,
an application was moved before the NCLT under sub-section (5)
of Section 60 of the IBC by the first respondent seeking a direction
to the second respondent to admit the first respondent’s claim as a
financial creditor. During the pendency of the said application before
the NCLT, the Committee of Creditors approved a resolution plan
submitted by M/s. Kals Distilleries Pvt. Ltd. The second respondent
applied to the NCLT to approve the resolution plan based on the
approval. On 18th January 2021, the NCLT rejected the application
made by the first respondent. Aggrieved by the said order, the first
respondent preferred an appeal before the NCLAT. By the impugned
judgment and order dated 7th October 2021, the NCLAT held that
the first respondent was a financial creditor and not an operational
creditor. The NCLT, on 13th October 2021 approved the resolution
plan of M/s. Kals Distilleries Pvt. Ltd. (Respondent no.6 in Civil
Appeal nos.6991-6994 of 2022) in the CIRP of the corporate debtor.
4. In Civil Appeal nos.6991-6994 of 2022, the second respondent is the
resolution professional. The corporate debtor is the same as in the
other appeal. The fifth respondent had provided financial assistance to
the corporate debtor of Rs.75,00,000/-. The fourth respondent provided
financial assistance to the corporate debtor of Rs.1,62,00,000/-. The
first respondent advanced a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- to the corporate
debtor. The third respondent advanced a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to the
corporate debtor. The Resolution Professional rejected the claims of
the four creditors as financial creditors. Therefore, they filed separate
applications before the NCLT by invoking sub-section (5) of Section
60 of the IBC. The NCLT rejected the applications. In the appeals
preferred by them before the NCLAT, the NCLAT allowed the appeals
by relying upon its judgment, which is the subject matter of challenge
in Civil Appeal no.1143 of 2022.
SUBMISSIONS
5. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in support
of Civil Appeal no. 1143 of 2022 submitted that the first respondent
220 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is an operational creditor going by the agreements dated 1st April
2014 and 1st April 2015. The reason is that the agreements indicate
that the corporate debtor appointed the first respondent to render
services to promote the beer manufactured by the corporate debtor.
He relied upon the definition of “operational debt” under sub-section
(21) of Section 5 of the IBC. He submitted that both the agreements
provided for paying a minimum security deposit by the first respondent
as a condition for being appointed as Sales Promoter of the corporate
debtor. He submitted that there was no intention on the part of the
corporate debtor to avail any financial facility from the first respondent.
He submitted that the amount paid towards the security deposit is
not the money disbursed to the corporate debtor towards financial
facilities availed by the corporate debtor. He submitted that the security
deposit paid by the first respondent would not qualify as a financial
debt defined under sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC. The learned
senior counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of
Swiss Ribbons Private Limited and Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.1.
He also relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Pioneer
Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India &
Ors.2. He submitted that the NCLAT was unnecessarily impressed by
the acknowledgement of liability and booking of interest component
towards the security deposit, despite the fact that it cannot be given
the overriding effect over the law. He relied upon the decisions of
this Court in the cases of Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals & Fertilisers
Ltd., Madras v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras3 and
Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited v. Hitro Energy
Solutions Private Limited4. He submitted that booking or payment
of interest is not the only criterion for ascertaining whether the debt
is a financial debt. The learned senior counsel, therefore, urged that
the view taken by the NCLAT in the impugned judgment is entirely
fallacious. He submitted that the NCLAT has virtually rewritten the
concepts of financial and operational debts incorporated in the IBC.
6. On facts, the learned senior counsel submitted that the payment of
the security deposit by the first respondent is a condition precedent
1 [2019] 3 SCR 535 : (2019) 4 SCC 17
2 [2019] 10 SCR 381 : (2019) 8 SCC 416
3 [1997] Supp. 1 SCR 528 : (1997) 6 SCC 117

[2024] 5 S.C.R. 221
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
for being appointed as a Sales Promoter of the corporate debtor.
The intent of the agreements is to appoint the first respondent as
the Sales Promoter and not to avail any financial facilities from the
first respondent. The amount paid by the first respondent does not
constitute financial facilities extended to the corporate debtor. There
was no intention to raise finance from the first respondent, who was
appointed as a Sales Promoter. The learned senior counsel also relied
upon the decisions of this court in the cases of Anuj Jain, Interim
Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited v. Axis Bank
Limited & Ors.5, Phoenix ARC Private Limited v. Spade Financial
Services Limited & Ors.6 and New Okhla Industrial Development
Authority v. Anand Sonbhadra7. Lastly, it is submitted that in the
case of an invoice involving any transaction, the delay in payment
attracts interest liability. Therefore, the payment of interest is not the
sole criterion for ascertaining whether a debt is a financial debt. He
would, thus, submit that the appeals deserve to be allowed.
7. The learned senior counsel appearing for the first respondent
submitted that the true nature of the agreements will have to be
examined for deciding the nature of the debt. He pointed out several
factual aspects, including the corporate debtor’s acknowledgement
of the liability of payment of interest on security deposit for the
Financial Years 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.
The corporate debtor deducted TDS on the interest payable to the
first respondent for three financial years. He submitted that the three
criteria, namely, disbursal, time value of money and commercial effect
of borrowing, are satisfied in the case of the present transaction. He
also relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Anuj Jain,
Interim Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited5.
He submitted that it was very clear from the terms of the agreement
that the money was repayable after a fixed tenure without a deduction
or provision for forfeiture. An interest @21% per annum was the
consideration for the time value of money. The learned counsel
submitted that the NCLAT was right in going into the issue of the
true nature and effect of the transaction reflected in the agreements.
Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pioneer Urban
5 [2020] 8 SCR 291 : (2020) 8 SCC 401
6 [2021] 15 SCR 1079 : (2021) 3 SCC 475
7 [2022] 5 SCR 319 : (2023) 1 SCC 724
222 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Land and Infrastructure Ltd2, the learned counsel submitted that
clause (f) of sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC is a “catch all”
and “residuary” provision which includes any transaction having the
commercial effect of borrowing and any transaction which is used
as a tool for raising finance.
8. The learned senior counsel submitted that the agreements entered
into were the tools for raising finance, and no actual services
have ever been rendered to the first respondent or other lenders.
Therefore, in view of the law laid down by this Court in the case
of V.E.A. Annamalai Chettiar & Ors. v. S.V.V.S. Veerappa
Chettiar & Ors.8, the true effect of the transaction has been taken
into consideration. It is pointed out that the corporate debtor has
established a practice of raising finance through private entities in
the garb of security deposit under various services agreements.
The learned counsel, therefore, submitted that no fault can be
found with the impugned judgment.
9. The learned counsel appearing for the second respondent-Resolution
Professional, supported the appellants by contending that the
money advanced by the first respondent cannot be categorised as
a financial debt. Therefore, the first respondent was an operational
creditor. He relied upon the definition of “operational debt” under
sub-section (21) of Section 5 of the IBC. He submitted that the
security deposit was not meant to reorganize the corporate debtor’s
debts. He submitted that the agreements are service agreements
by which the corporate debtor agreed to take services from the first
respondent for consideration. Therefore, the security deposit was
obviously to ensure the performance of the terms of the agreements
by the first respondent. He submitted that accounting treatment
cannot override the law and the definition of “operational debt” under
the IBC. He submitted that none of the ingredients of clauses (a) to
(f) of sub-section (8) of Section 5 are present in the case at hand.
In this case, there is no disbursal of debt. He submitted that there
was no financial contract between the corporate debtor and the first
respondent. Lastly, he submitted that in view of the judgment dated
29th September 2018 of the NCLAT on an application filed by M/s.
New View Consultants Pvt. Ltd., the second respondent categorised
8 AIR 1956 SC 12
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 223
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
the first respondent as operational creditor. He would, therefore,
submit that the view taken by the NCLAT was not correct.
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DEBT
10. Sub-section (11) of Section 3 of the IBC defines ‘debt’, which reads
thus:
“3. In this Code, unless the context otherwise requires,-
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
(11) “debt” means a liability or obligation in respect of a
claim which is due from any person and includes a financial
debt and operational debt;
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .”
Thus, a debt has to be a liability or obligation in respect of a claim
that is due from any person. Sub-section (11) uses the words “means”
and “includes”. Financial debt and operational debt are included in
the definition of debt. Thus, financial debt or operational debt must
arise out of a liability or obligation in respect of a claim.
11. “Claim” is defined under sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the IBC,
which reads thus:
“3. In this Code, unless the context otherwise requires,-
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .
(6) “claim” means –
(a) a right to payment, whether or not such right is
reduced to judgment, fixed, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured;
(b) right to remedy for breach of contract under any
law for the time being in force, if such breach
gives rise to a right to payment, whether or
not such right is reduced to judgment, fixed,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured;
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .”
224 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Clause (a) shows that every right to receive payment is a claim,
whether or not such right is reduced to a judgment. A right to
receive payment is a claim, even if disputed, undisputed, secured,
or unsecured. The right to receive payment can be either legal or
equitable. Clause (b) includes the right to remedy for a breach of
contract under any law for the time being in force. Thus, a liability
or obligation is not covered by the definition of “debt” unless it is
in respect of a claim covered by sub-section (6) of Section 3 of
the IBC.
12. Sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC defines “financial debt”,
which reads thus:
“5. In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,-
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
(8) “financial debt” means a debt alongwith interest, if
any, which is disbursed against the consideration
for the time value of money and includes–
(a) money borrowed against the payment of interest;
(b) any amount raised by acceptance under any
acceptance credit facility or its dematerialised
equivalent;
(c) any amount raised pursuant to any note purchase
facility or the issue of bonds, notes, debentures, loan
stock or any similar instrument;
(d) the amount of any liability in respect of any lease
or hire purchase contract which is deemed as a
finance or capital lease under the Indian Accounting
Standards or such other accounting standards as
may be prescribed;
(e) receivables sold or discounted other than any
receivables sold on non-recourse basis;
(f) any amount raised under any other transaction,
including any forward sale or purchase agreement,
having the commercial effect of a borrowing;
[Explanation. -For the purposes of this sub-clause,-
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 225
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
(i) any amount raised from an allottee under
a real estate project shall be deemed to be
an amount having the commercial effect
of a borrowing; and
(ii) the expressions, “allottee” and “real
estate project” shall have the meanings
respectively assigned to them in clauses
(d) and (zn) of section 2 of the Real Estate
(Regulation and Development) Act, 2016
(16 of 2016);]
(g) any derivative transaction entered into in connection
with protection against or benefit from fluctuation in
any rate or price and for calculating the value of any
derivative transaction, only the market value of such
transaction shall be taken into account;
(h) any counter-indemnity obligation in respect of a
guarantee, indemnity, bond, documentary letter of
credit or any other instrument issued by a bank or
financial institution;
(i) the amount of any liability in respect of any of the
guarantee or indemnity for any of the items referred
to in sub-clause (a) to (h) of this clause.”
(emphasis added)
The definition incorporates the expression “means and includes”.
The first part of the definition, which starts with the word “means”,
provides that there has to be a debt along with interest, if any, which
is disbursed against the consideration for the time value of money.
The word “and” appears after the word “money”. Before the words
“and includes”, the legislature has not incorporated a comma. After
the word “includes”, the legislature has incorporated categories (a)
to (i) of financial debts. Hence, the cases covered by categories
(a) to (i) must satisfy the test laid down by the earlier part of the
sub-section (8). The test laid down therein is that there has to be
a debt along with interest, if any, and it must be disbursed against
the consideration for the time value of money. This Court had an
occasion to deal with the definition of “financial debt” in its various
226 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
decisions. The first decision is in the case of Anuj Jain, Interim
Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited5. Paragraphs
46 to 50 read thus:
“The essentials for financial debt and financial creditor
46. Applying the aforementioned fundamental principles
to the definition occurring in Section 5(8) of the Code,
we have not an iota of doubt that for a debt to become
“financial debt” for the purpose of Part II of the Code, the
basic elements are that it ought to be a disbursal against
the consideration for time value of money. It may include
any of the methods for raising money or incurring liability
by the modes prescribed in clauses (a) to (f) of Section
5(8); it may also include any derivative transaction or
counter-indemnity obligation as per clauses (g) and (h)
of Section 5(8); and it may also be the amount of any
liability in respect of any of the guarantee or indemnity
for any of the items referred to in clauses (a) to (h). The
requirement of existence of a debt, which is disbursed
against the consideration for the time value of money,
in our view, remains an essential part even in respect
of any of the transactions/dealings stated in clauses
(a) to (i) of Section 5(8), even if it is not necessarily
stated therein. In any case, the definition, by its very
frame, cannot be read so expansive, rather infinitely
wide, that the root requirements of “disbursement” against
“the consideration for the time value of money” could be
forsaken in the manner that any transaction could stand
alone to become a financial debt. In other words, any
of the transactions stated in the said clauses (a) to
(i) of Section 5(8) would be falling within the ambit
of “financial debt” only if it carries the essential
elements stated in the principal clause or at least
has the features which could be traced to such
essential elements in the principal clause. In yet
other words, the essential element of disbursal, and
that too against the consideration for time value of
money, needs to be found in the genesis of any debt
before it may be treated as “financial debt” within
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 227
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
the meaning of Section 5(8) of the Code. This debt
may be of any nature but a part of it is always required
to be carrying, or corresponding to, or at least having
some traces of disbursal against consideration for the
time value of money.
47. As noticed, the root requirement for a creditor to
become financial creditor for the purpose of Part II of the
Code, there must be a financial debt which is owed to
that person. He may be the principal creditor to whom
the financial debt is owed or he may be an assignee in
terms of extended meaning of this definition but, and
nevertheless, the requirement of existence of a debt being
owed is not forsaken.
48. It is also evident that what is being dealt with and
described in Section 5(7) and in Section 5(8) is the
transaction vis-à-vis the corporate debtor. Therefore, for
a person to be designated as a financial creditor of the
corporate debtor, it has to be shown that the corporate
debtor owes a financial debt to such person. Understood
this way, it becomes clear that a third party to whom the
corporate debtor does not owe a financial debt cannot
become its financial creditor for the purpose of Part II of
the Code.
49. Expounding yet further, in our view, the peculiar elements
of these expressions “financial creditor” and “financial debt”,
as occurring in Sections 5(7) and 5(8), when visualised
and compared with the generic expressions “creditor” and
“debt” respectively, as occurring in Sections 3(10) and 3(11)
of the Code, the scheme of things envisaged by the Code
becomes clearer. The generic term “creditor” is defined
to mean any person to whom the debt is owed and then,
it has also been made clear that it includes a “financial
creditor”, a “secured creditor”, an “unsecured creditor”, an
“operational creditor”, and a “decree-holder”. Similarly, a
“debt” means a liability or obligation in respect of a claim
which is due from any person and this expression has also
been given an extended meaning to include a “financial
debt” and an “operational debt”.
228 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
49.1. The use of the expression “means and includes”
in these clauses, on the very same principles of
interpretation as indicated above, makes it clear that
for a person to become a creditor, there has to be a
debt i.e. a liability or obligation in respect of a claim
which may be due from any person. A “secured creditor”
in terms of Section 3(30) means a creditor in whose favour
a security interest is created; and “security interest”, in terms
of Section 3(31), means a right, title or interest or claim
of property created in favour of or provided for a secured
creditor by a transaction which secures payment for the
purpose of an obligation and it includes, amongst others, a
mortgage. Thus, any mortgage created in favour of a creditor
leads to a security interest being created and thereby, the
creditor becomes a secured creditor. However, when all
the defining clauses are read together and harmoniously,
it is clear that the legislature has maintained a distinction
amongst the expressions “financial creditor”, “operational
creditor”, “secured creditor” and “unsecured creditor”. Every
secured creditor would be a creditor; and every financial
creditor would also be a creditor but every secured creditor
may not be a financial creditor. As noticed, the expressions
“financial debt” and “financial creditor”, having their specific
and distinct connotations and roles in insolvency and
liquidation process of corporate persons, have only been
defined in Part II whereas the expressions “secured creditor”
and “security interest” are defined in Part I.
50. A conjoint reading of the statutory provisions with
the enunciation of this Court in Swiss Ribbons [Swiss
Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 4 SCC 17] ,
leaves nothing to doubt that in the scheme of the IBC,
what is intended by the expression “financial creditor” is
a person who has direct engagement in the functioning
of the corporate debtor; who is involved right from the
beginning while assessing the viability of the corporate
debtor; who would engage in restructuring of the loan
as well as in reorganisation of the corporate debtor's
business when there is financial stress. In other words,
the financial creditor, by its own direct involvement in a
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 229
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
functional existence of corporate debtor, acquires unique
position, who could be entrusted with the task of ensuring
the sustenance and growth of the corporate debtor,
akin to that of a guardian. In the context of insolvency
resolution process, this class of stakeholders, namely,
financial creditors, is entrusted by the legislature with
such a role that it would look forward to ensure that
the corporate debtor is rejuvenated and gets back to its
wheels with reasonable capacity of repaying its debts
and to attend on its other obligations. Protection of the
rights of all other stakeholders, including other creditors,
would obviously be concomitant of such resurgence of
the corporate debtor.
50.1. Keeping the objectives of the Code in view, the
position and role of a person having only security interest
over the assets of the corporate debtor could easily be
contrasted with the role of a financial creditor because
the former shall have only the interest of realising the
value of its security (there being no other stakes involved
and least any stake in the corporate debtor's growth or
equitable liquidation) while the latter would, apart from
looking at safeguards of its own interests, would also and
simultaneously be interested in rejuvenation, revival and
growth of the corporate debtor. Thus understood, it is clear
that if the former i.e. a person having only security interest
over the assets of the corporate debtor is also included
as a financial creditor and thereby allowed to have its say
in the processes contemplated by Part II of the Code, the
growth and revival of the corporate debtor may be the
casualty. Such result would defeat the very objective and
purpose of the Code, particularly of the provisions aimed
at corporate insolvency resolution.
50.2. Therefore, we have no hesitation in saying that a
person having only security interest over the assets of
corporate debtor (like the instant third-party securities),
even if falling within the description of “secured creditor”
by virtue of collateral security extended by the corporate
debtor, would nevertheless stand outside the sect of
230 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“financial creditors” as per the definitions contained
in sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 5 of the Code.
Differently put, if a corporate debtor has given its property
in mortgage to secure the debts of a third party, it may
lead to a mortgage debt and, therefore, it may fall within
the definition of “debt” under Section 3(10) of the Code.
However, it would remain a debt alone and cannot partake
the character of a “financial debt” within the meaning of
Section 5(8) of the Code.”
(emphasis added)
A Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court in the case of Phoenix
ARC Private Limited6 dealt with the issue in greater detail. It also
dealt with the concept of the time value of money. In paragraphs 44
to 47 of the said decision, this Court held thus:
“44. Section 5(8) IBC provides a definition of “financial
debt” in the following terms:
XXX XXX XXX
G.3.2. Financial creditor and financial debt
45. Under Section 5(7) IBC, a person can be categorised
as a financial creditor if a financial debt is owed to it.
Section 5(8) IBC stipulates that the essential ingredient
of a financial debt is disbursal against consideration for
the time value of money. This Court, speaking through
Rohinton F. Nariman, J., in Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union
of India [Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019)
4 SCC 17] has held : (SCC p. 64, para 42)
“42. A perusal of the definition of “financial
creditor” and “financial debt” makes it clear that
a financial debt is a debt together with interest, if
any, which is disbursed against the consideration
for time value of money. It may further be money
that is borrowed or raised in any of the manners
prescribed in Section 5(8) or otherwise, as
Section 5(8) is an inclusive definition. On the
other hand, an “operational debt” would include
a claim in respect of the provision of goods or
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 231
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
services, including employment, or a debt in
respect of payment of dues arising under any
law and payable to the Government or any
local authority.”
(emphasis supplied)
46. In this context, it would be relevant to discuss the
meaning of the terms “disburse” and “time value of money”
used in the principal clause of Section 5(8) IBC. This Court
has interpreted the term “disbursal” in Pioneer Urban Land
& Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India [Pioneer Urban Land
& Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 8 SCC 416
: (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 1] in the following terms : (SCC p.
511, paras 70-71)
“70. The definition of “financial debt” in Section
5(8) then goes on to state that a “debt” must be
“disbursed” against the consideration for time
value of money. “Disbursement” is defined in
Black’s Law Dictionary (10th Edn.) to mean:
‘1. The act of paying out money, commonly from
a fund or in settlement of a debt or account
payable. 2. The money so paid; an amount of
money given for a particular purpose.’
71. In the present context, it is clear that the expression
“disburse” would refer to the payment of instalments by the
allottee to the real estate developer for the particular purpose
of funding the real estate project in which the allottee is
to be allotted a flat/apartment. The expression “disbursed”
refers to money which has been paid against consideration
for the “time value of money”. In short, the “disbursal” must
be money and must be against consideration for the “time
value of money”, meaning thereby, the fact that such money
is now no longer with the lender, but is with the borrower,
who then utilises the money.”
47. The report of the Insolvency Law Committee dated
26-3-2018 has discussed the interpretation of the term
“time value of money” and stated:
232 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“1.4. The current definition of “financial debt”
under Section 5(8) of the Code uses the words
“ [Ed. : The matter between two asterisks has
been emphasised in original.] includes [Ed. :
The matter between two asterisks has been
emphasised in original.] ”, thus the kinds of
financial debts illustrated are not exhaustive.
The phrase “ [Ed. : The matter between two
asterisks has been emphasised in original.]
disbursed against the consideration for the time
value of money [Ed. : The matter between two
asterisks has been emphasised in original.]
” has been the subject of interpretation only
in a handful of cases under the Code. The
words “time value” have been interpreted
to mean compensation or the price paid for
the length of time for which the money has
been disbursed. This may be in the form of
interest paid on the money, or factoring of
a discount in the payment.”
(emphasis added)”
In the case of Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. & Anr2,
this issue was dealt with in paragraphs 76 and 77, which read thus:
“76. Sub-clause (f) Section 5(8) thus read would
subsume within it amounts raised under transactions
which are not necessarily loan transactions, so long
as they have the commercial effect of a borrowing. We
were referred to Collins English Dictionary & Thesaurus
(2nd Edn., 2000) for the meaning of the expression “borrow”
and the meaning of the expression “commercial”. They
are set out hereinbelow:
“borrow.—vb 1. to obtain or receive (something,
such as money) on loan for temporary use,
intending to give it, or something equivalent
back to the lender. 2. to adopt (ideas, words,
etc.) from another source; appropriate. 3. Not
standard. to lend. 4. (intr) Golf. To putt the ball
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 233
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
uphill of the direct path to the hole:make sure
you borrow enough.”
***
“commercial.—adj. 1. of or engaged in
commerce. 2. sponsored or paid for by an
advertiser: commercial television. 3. having
profit as the main aim: commercial music. 4.(of
chemicals, etc.) unrefined and produced in bulk
for use in industry. 5. a commercially sponsored
advertisement on radio or television.”
77. A perusal of these definitions would show that even
though the petitioners may be right in stating that a
“borrowing” is a loan of money for temporary use, they are
not necessarily right in stating that the transaction must
culminate in money being given back to the lender. The
expression “borrow” is wide enough to include an advance
given by the homebuyers to a real estate developer for
“temporary use” i.e. for use in the construction project so
long as it is intended by the agreement to give “something
equivalent” to money back to the homebuyers. The
“something equivalent” in these matters is obviously the
flat/apartment. Also of importance is the expression
“commercial effect”. “Commercial” would generally
involve transactions having profit as their main aim.
Piecing the threads together, therefore, so long as an
amount is “raised” under a real estate agreement, which
is done with profit as the main aim, such amount would
be subsumed within Section 5(8)(f) as the sale agreement
between developer and home buyer would have the
“commercial effect” of a borrowing, in that, money is paid
in advance for temporary use so that a flat/apartment is
given back to the lender. Both parties have “commercial”
interests in the same—the real estate developer seeking
to make a profit on the sale of the apartment, and the flat/
apartment purchaser profiting by the sale of the apartment.
Thus construed, there can be no difficulty in stating that the
amounts raised from allottees under real estate projects
would, in fact, be subsumed within Section 5(8)(f) even

FINDINGS ON FACTUAL ASPECTS
13. In light of the interpretation put by this Court to the definition of
financial debt, it is necessary to come back to the facts of the case.
The relevant agreements for our consideration are in the form of
letters dated 1st April 2014 and 1st April 2015. The corporate debtor
addressed the letters to the first respondent. The relevant part of
the agreement/letter dated 1st April 2014 reads thus:
“.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
SACH MARKETING PVT LTD
JHARKHAND

.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .”
(emphasis added)
As seen from clause (4), the agreement was only for twelve months
ending on 31st March 2015. Therefore, on 1st April 2015, another
letter was issued by the corporate debtor to the first respondent,
incorporating identical terms and conditions. The only difference is
236 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the agreement’s duration was up to 31st March 2016. Clause
(10) of the agreement/letter dated 1st April 2015 reads thus:
“.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
#10 You have to deposit minimum security of Rs.53,15,000/-
with the Company which will carry interest @21% per
annum.
We will provide you interest on Rs.32,85,850/- @21% per
annum. Please acknowledge receipt and as a token of
your acceptance of above terms and conditions.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .”
14. Where one party owes a debt to another and when the creditor
is claiming under a written agreement/arrangement providing for
rendering ‘service’, the debt is an operational debt only if the claim
subject matter of the debt has some connection or co-relation with
the ‘service’ subject matter of the transaction. The written document
cannot be taken for its face value. Therefore, it is necessary to
determine the real nature of the transaction on a plain reading of
the agreements. What is surprising is that for acting as a Sales
Promoter of the beer manufactured by a corporate debtor, only a sum
of Rs.4,000/- per month was made payable to the first respondent.
Apart from the sum of Rs.4,000/- per month, there is no commission
payable to the first respondent on the quantity of sales. Clause (6)
provides for termination of the appointment by giving thirty days’
notice. Though clause (10) provides for the payment of the security
deposit by the first respondent, it is pertinent to note that there is no
clause for the forfeiture of the security deposit. The amount specified
in clause (10) has no correlation whatsoever with the performance
of the other conditions of the contract by the first respondent. As
there is no clause regarding forfeiture of the security deposit or part
thereof, the corporate debtor was liable to refund the security deposit
after the period specified therein was over with interest @21% per
annum. Since the security deposit payment had no correlation with
any other clause under the agreements, as held by the NCLAT, the
security deposit amounts represent debts covered by sub-section
(11) of Section 3 of the IBC. The reason is that the right of the first
respondent to seek a refund of the security deposit with interest is a
claim within the meaning of sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the IBC
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 237
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
as the first respondent is seeking a right to payment of the deposit
amount with interest. Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that
there is a debt in the form of a security deposit mentioned in the
said two agreements.
15. Sub-section (21) of Section 5 defines “operational debt”, which
reads thus:
“5. In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,-
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
(21) “operational debt” means a claim in respect of the
provision of goods or services including employment or
a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under
any law for the time being in force and payable to the
Central Government, any State Government or any local
authority;
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .”
The second part of the definition which deals with the payment
of dues arising under any law, will not apply. However, for the
applicability of the first part, the claim must be concerning the
provisions of goods or services. Therefore, in the case of a contract
of service, there must be a correlation between the service as agreed
to be provided under the agreement and the claim. The reason is
that the definition uses the phraseology “a claim in respect of the
provision of goods or services”. Assuming that both the agreements
are genuine in the sense that they reflect the true nature of the
transaction, the only claim under the agreements which will have
any connection with the services rendered by the first respondent
will be the claim of Rs.4,000/- per month as provided in clause
(1) of both the agreements. Only this claim can be said to be
concerning the provision of services. Therefore, by no stretch of
imagination, the debt claimed by the first respondent can be an
operational debt. We are conscious of the fact that the provision
for payment of interest by the corporate debtor by itself is not the
only material factor in deciding the nature of the debt. But, in the
facts of the case, the payment of the amount mentioned in clause
(10) of the letter has no relation with the service supposed to be
rendered by the first respondent.
238 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
16. Now, coming back to the definition of a financial debt under sub-
section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC, in the facts of the case, there
is no doubt that there is a debt with interest @21% per annum.
The provision made for interest payment shows that it represents
consideration for the time value of money. Now, we come to clause
(f) of sub-section (8) of Section 5 of the IBC. The first condition of
applicability of clause (f) is that the amount must be raised under
any other transaction. Any other transaction means a transaction
which is not covered by clauses (a) to (e). Clause (f) covers all
those transactions not covered by any of these sub-clauses of sub-
section (8) that satisfy the test in the first part of Section 8. The
condition for the applicability of clause (f) is that the transaction
must have the commercial effect of borrowing. “Transaction” has
been defined in sub-section (33) of Section 3 of the IBC, which
includes an agreement or arrangement in writing for the transfer of
assets, funds, goods, etc., from or to the corporate debtor. In this
case, there is an arrangement in writing for the transfer of funds to
the corporate debtor. Therefore, the first condition incorporated in
clause (f) is fulfilled.
17. To decide whether the second condition had been fulfilled, it is
necessary to refer to the factual findings recorded in the impugned
judgment. The NCLAT has referred to the letter dated 26th October
2017 addressed by the corporate debtor to the first respondent. We
have perused a copy of the said letter annexed to the counter. By
the said letter, the corporate debtor informed the first respondent
that for the year 2016-2017, the corporate debtor had provided the
interest amounting to Rs.18,06,000/- in the books of the corporate
debtor and that the sum will be credited to the account of the first
respondent on the date of payment of TDS. In paragraph 21 of the
impugned judgment, it is held that the financial statement of the first
respondent for the Financial Year 2017-2018 shows revenue from
the interest on the security deposit. It is also held that the amounts
were treated as long-term loans and advances in the financial
statement of the corporate debtor for the Financial Year 2015-2016.
Moreover, in the financial statement of the corporate debtor for the
Financial Year 2016-17, the amounts paid by the first respondent
were shown as “other long-term liabilities”. Therefore, if the letter
mentioned above and the financial statements of the corporate
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 239
Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr. v. Sach Marketing Pvt. Ltd. & Anr
debtor are considered, it is evident that the amount raised under
the said two agreements has the commercial effect of borrowing
as the corporate debtor treated the said amount as borrowed from
the first respondent.
","18. Therefore, we have no hesitation in concurring with the NCLAT’s view
that the amounts covered by security deposits under the agreements
constitute financial debt. As it is a financial debt owed by the first
respondent, sub-section (7) of Section 5 of the IBC makes the first
respondent a financial creditor.
19. The contracts subject matter of the Civil Appeal Nos. 6991 to 6994
of 2022 are in the form of letters, which provide for similar clauses
as in the case of agreements subject matter of Civil Appeal No.
1143 of 2022.
SUMMARY
20. Subject to what is held above, we summarize our legal conclusions:
a. There cannot be a debt within the meaning of sub-section (11)
of section 5 of the IB Code unless there is a claim within the
meaning of sub-section (6) of section 5 of thereof;
b. The test to determine whether a debt is a financial debt within
the meaning of sub-section (8) of section 5 is the existence of
a debt along with interest, if any, which is disbursed against the
consideration for the time value of money. The cases covered
by categories (a) to (i) of sub-section (8) must satisfy the said
test laid down by the earlier part of sub-section (8) of section 5;
c. While deciding the issue of whether a debt is a financial debt
or an operational debt arising out of a transaction covered by
an agreement or arrangement in writing, it is necessary to
ascertain what is the real nature of the transaction reflected in
the writing; and
d. Where one party owes a debt to another and when the creditor
is claiming under a written agreement/ arrangement providing
for rendering ‘service’, the debt is an operational debt only if
the claim subject matter of the debt has some connection or
co-relation with the ‘service’ subject matter of the transaction.

Professional shall continue with the CIRP process in accordance

Communicable Diseases and Anr.
(Civil Appeal No. 2646 of 2009)
14 May 2024
[Bela M. Trivedi* and Pankaj Mithal,* JJ.]","Matter pertains to whether a complaint alleging “deficiency in
service” against advocates practising legal profession, would be
maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as re-
enacted in 2019; whether “Service” hired or availed of an advocate
would fall within the definition of “Service” contained in the C.P.
Act, 1986/2019; whether the legislature ever intended to include
the professions or services rendered by the professionals within
the purview of the CP Act 1986 as re-enacted in 2019; whether the
legal profession is sui generis; and whether service hired or availed
of an advocate could be said to be the service under “contract of
personal service” so as to exclude it from the definition of “Service”
contained in s. 2(42) of the CP Act 2019.
","Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – Consumer Protection Act,
2019 – Complaint alleging “deficiency in service” against
Advocates practising Legal Profession – Maintainability –
District Forum held that it had the jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the dispute between the parties and decided the
complaint in favour of the complainant – However, the State
Commission held that the services of lawyers/advocates did
not fall within the ambit of “service” defined u/s. 2(1)(o) of
the 1986 Act – In Revision, the National Commission held
inter alia that if there was any deficiency in service rendered
by the Advocates/Lawyers, a complaint under the 1986 Act
would be maintainable – Correctness:
Held: Services hired or availed of an Advocate would be that of
a contract ‘of personal service’ and would thus, stand excluded
from the definition of “service” contained in the s. 2(42) of the CP

Act, 2019 – In view thereof, the complaint alleging “deficiency in
service” against Advocates practising legal profession would not
be maintainable under the CP Act, 2019 – Thus, the impugned
judgment passed by the National Commission set aside [Paras
42, 43] – Held: Per Pankaj Mithal, J. (Concurring) In the era of
globalization, a law has to be applied in context with the prevailing
situation of the country, nonetheless, on the basis of the common
resolution of the UNO, laws must have a uniform application in
all nations – It is, thus, essential that the consumer protection
laws in all countries may somewhat have universal application
and be confined to ‘consumers’ only i.e. to the persons who buys
any goods for consideration or hires or avails of any service
for consideration, impliedly excluding the professional services
especially that of a lawyer – In doing so, in India also the services of
professionals more particularly that of lawyers have to be excluded
from consumer protection law in accordance with the intention
expressed in enacting the same – Legislature in India as in some
other countries, had not intended to include the services rendered
by the professionals especially the lawyers to their client within
the purview of CP Act, 1986 and re-enacted in 2019 – Thus, the
view taken by the National Commission that complaint would be
maintainable in CP Act, 1986, in respect of deficiency in service
rendered by the lawyers, is incorrect and is set aside. [Paras 24-28]
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – Consumer Protection Act,
2019 – Legislature, if intended to include the Professions or
services rendered by the Professionals within the purview
of the CP Act 1986/2019:
Held: The very purpose and object of the CP Act 1986 as re-
enacted in 2019 was to provide protection to the consumers from
unfair trade practices and unethical business practices – Legislature
never intended to include either the Professions or the services
rendered by the Professionals within the purview of the said Acts
– Other object of the Act was to provide to the consumers timely
and effective administration and settlement of their disputes arising
out of the unfair trade and unethical business practices – If the
services provided by all the Professionals are also brought within
the purview of the Act, there would be flood-gate of litigations
in the commissions/forums established under the Act, and the
very object of Act would be frustrated – Legislative draftsmen
are presumed to know the law and there is no reason to assume
that the legislature intended to include the Professions or the
486 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Professionals or the services provided by them within the ambit
of the CP Act – Any interpretation of the Preamble or the scheme
of the Act for construing ‘Profession’ as ‘Business’ or ‘Trade’; or
‘Professional’ as ‘service provider’ would be extending the scope
of the Act which was not intended, rather would have a counter
productive effect. [Paras 42, 19, 20, 18]
Legal Profession – Legal Profession is sui generis or is
different from the other Profession:
Held: Having regard to the role, status and duties of the Advocates
as the professionals, the legal profession is sui generis i.e unique in
nature and cannot be compared with any other profession – Legal
profession is different from the other professions for the reason that
what the Advocates do, affects not only an individual but the entire
administration of justice, which is the foundation of the civilized
society – Legal profession is a solemn and serious profession,
and has always been held in very high esteem – Their services
in making the judicial system efficient, effective and credible, and
in creating a strong and impartial Judiciary, which could not be
compared with the services rendered by other professionals [Paras
42, 30] – Held: Per Pankaj Mithal, J. (Concurring) Profession of
law, as such, is regarded as sui generis i.e. which is unique – It is
distinct from all other professions and is one of its own kind. [Para 3]
Consumer Protection Act, 2019 – s. 2(42) – Service hired or
availed of an Advocate, if could be said to be the service
under a “contract of personal service” so as to exclude it
from the definition of “Service” contained in s. 2(42):
Held: Service hired or availed of an Advocate is a service under
“a contract of personal service,” and thus, would fall within the
exclusionary part of the definition of “Service” contained in s.
2(42) – Greater the amount of direct control exercised over the
person rendering the services by the person contracting for them,
the stronger would be the grounds for holding it to be a “contract
of service” – Considerable amount of direct control is exercised
by the Client over the manner in which an Advocate renders his
services during the course of his employment. [Paras 42, 39, 41]
Reference to larger Bench – Three-Judge Bench decision in
*Indian Medical Association vs. V.P. Shantha & Others holding
inter alia that the wide amplitude of the definition of ‘service’ in
the main part of s. 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 487
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
would cover the services rendered by Medical Practitioners
within the said s. 2(1)(o) of the Act – Correctness:
Held: Having regard to the history, object, purpose and the
scheme of the CP Act and that neither the “Profession” could
be treated as “business” or “trade” nor the services provided
by the “Professionals” could be treated at par with the services
provided by the Businessmen or the Traders, so as to bring them
within the purview of the CP Act, the decision in *Indian Medical
Association vs. V.P Shantha’s case to be revisited and considered
by a larger bench – Thus, matter referred to Hon’ble the Chief
Justice of India for consideration – Supreme Court Rules – Order
VI r 2. [Paras 21, 24]
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – Consumer Protection Act,
2019 – Scope and object of – Intention of the legislature:
Held: The said Act was enacted to provide for the better protection
of the interests of the consumers against their exploitation by the
traders and manufacturers of the consumer goods, and to help
consumers in getting justice and fair treatment in the matter of
goods and services purchased and availed by them in a market
dominated by large trading and manufacturing bodies – Reasons
for re-enacting the CP Act, 2019 by the Legislature, were certain
shortcomings found in the CP Act 1986 while administering the
said Act, and due to the emergence of global supply chains, rise in
international trade and rapid development of ecommerce leading to
new systems for goods and services, new options and opportunities
had become available to the consumers – New forms of unfair
trade and unethical business practices also came to be developed,
which made the consumers more vulnerable – Furthermore, there
was not a whisper in the statement of objects and reasons either
of the CP Act, 1986 or 2019 to include the Professions or the
Services provided by the Professionals like Advocates, Doctors
etc. within the purview of the Act – Professionals could not be
called Businessmen or Traders, nor Clients or Patients be called
Consumers. [Paras 12, 14, 15]
Words and phrases – Definition of term “Profession” –
Meaning and explanation of:
Held: “Profession” would require advanced education and training
in some branch of learning or science – Nature of work is also
skilled and specialised one, substantial part of which would be
488 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
mental rather than manual – Thus, having regard to the nature
of work of a professional, which requires high level of education,
training and proficiency and which involves skilled and specialized
kind of mental work, operating in the specialized spheres, where
achieving success would depend upon many other factors beyond
a man’s control, a Professional cannot be treated equally or at
par with a Businessman or a Trader or a Service provider of
products or goods as contemplated in the Consumer Protection
Act – Similarly, services rendered by Businessman or Trader
to consumers with regard to his goods or products cannot be
equated with the Services provided by Professional to his clients
with regard to his specialized branch of profession. [Paras 15, 18]
Legal profession – Justice Delivery System and the evolving
jurisprudence – Role of Advocates:
Held: Legal profession cannot be equated with any other traditional
professions – It is not commercial in nature but is essentially
a service oriented, noble profession – Role of Advocates is
indispensable in the Justice Delivery System – Evolution of
jurisprudence to keep the Constitution vibrant is possible only
with the positive contribution of the Advocates – Advocates are
expected to be fearless and independent for protecting the rights
of citizens, for upholding the Rule of law and also for protecting
the Independence of Judiciary – People repose immense faith in
the Judiciary, and the Bar being an integral part of the Judicial
System has been assigned a very crucial role for preserving the
independence of the Judiciary, and in turn the very democratic set
up of the Nation – Advocates are perceived to be the intellectuals
amongst the elites and social activists amongst the downtrodden,
thus are expected to act with utmost good faith, integrity, fairness
and loyalty while handling the legal proceedings of his client –
Being a responsible officer of the court and an important adjunct
of the administration of justice, an Advocate owes his duty not only
to his client but also to the court as well as to the opposite side
[Para 29] – Held: Per Pankaj Mithal, J. (Concurring) Profession
of law is a noble profession having an element of duty towards
the court – Lawyers perform multi-faceted duties – They not
only have a duty towards the client or their opponents but they
have a paramount duty to assist the court as well – In a way,
they are officers as well as ambassadors of the court – Thus, in
rendering such kind of a duty to enable the courts to come to a

just conclusion, it may be possible that at times, the lawyers may
earn displeasure of the client while assisting the court. [Para 2]
Advocates Act, 1961 – Advocate – Legal Practitioner –
Definition of, and explanation:
Held: Advocate is included in the definition of “Legal Practitioner”
but legal practitioner is not included in the definition of Advocate

entered in the State roll is entitled as of right to practice in all Courts
including the Supreme Court and before any Tribunal or any other
authority or person before whom such advocate is by or under any
law for the time being in force entitled to practice – Comprehensive
provisions are contained in the Advocates Act, 1961 and the Bar
Council of India Rules to take care of the professional misconduct of
the Advocates, and prescribing the punishments if they are found guilty
of professional or other misconduct by the Disciplinary Committees
of the State Bar Council or the Bar Council of India. [Para 34]
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 2(1)(o) – Consumer
Protection Act, 2019 – s. 2(42) – Definition of “Service”
contained in s. 2(1)(o) of the CP Act 1986 and in s. 2(42) of
the CP Act 2019 – Elucidation:
Held: Definition of “Service” contained in s. 2(1)(o) of the CP Act
1986 and in s. 2(42) of the CP Act 2019 is the same – Definition
of ‘service’ is divided into three parts-first part is explanatory in
nature and defines service to mean service of any description
which is made available to the potential users; the second part
is inclusionary part, which expressly includes the provision of
facilities in connection with the specific services; and the third part
is exclusionary part which excludes rendering of any service free
of charge or under a contract of personal service. [Paras 35, 37]

Protection Act, 2019 – s. 2(11) – Definition of ‘Deficiency’ in
s. 2(1)(g) of 1986 Act and s. 2(11) of 2019 Act:
Held: There is slight difference in the definition of ‘Deficiency’ in
s. 2(1)(g) of 1986 Act and s. 2(11) of 2019 Act. [Para 36]
490 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Advocates – Relationship between an Advocate and his
Client – Nature of control – Unique attributes:
Held : Advocates are generally perceived to be their client’s agents
and owe fiduciary duties to their clients – Advocates are fastened
with all the traditional duties that agents owe to their principals –
Advocates have to respect the client’s autonomy to make decisions
at a minimum, as to the objectives of the representation – Advocates
are not entitled to make concessions or give any undertaking to the
Court without express instructions from the Client – It is the solemn
duty of an Advocate not to transgress the authority conferred on him
by his Client – Advocate is bound to seek appropriate instructions
from the Client or his authorized agent before taking any action
or making any statement or concession which may, directly or
remotely, affect the legal rights of the Client – Advocate represents
the client before the Court and conducts proceedings on behalf of
the client – He is the only link between the court and the client –
Thus, his responsibility is onerous – He is expected to follow the
instructions of his client rather than substitute his judgment – Thus,
a considerable amount of direct control is exercised by the Client
over the manner in which an Advocate renders his services during
the course of his employment. [Para 41]

Bela M. Trivedi, J.
1. An important question of law pertaining to the Legal Profession as a
whole that has fallen for consideration before this Court is – whether a
complaint alleging “deficiency in service” against Advocates practising
Legal Profession, would be maintainable under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 as re-enacted in 2019? In other words, whether
a “Service” hired or availed of an Advocate would fall within the
definition of “Service” contained in the C.P. Act, 1986/2019, so as
to bring him within the purview of the said Act?
2. The present set of Appeals emanate from the impugned order dated
06.08.2007 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (NCDRC), New Delhi in Revision Petition No.1392/2006,
in which the NCDRC has held inter alia that if there was any deficiency
in service rendered by the Advocates/Lawyers, a complaint under
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “CP Act, 1986”) would
be maintainable.
FACTUAL MATRIX
3. The short facts in C.A. No.2649/2009, arising out of the impugned
order passed by the NCDRC are that: -
494 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(i) The appellant is an Advocate by profession. The respondent
Mr. D.K. Gandhi had hired the services of the appellant as an
advocate for filing a Complaint in the Court of Metropolitan
Magistrate, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi, against one Kamal Sharma
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, as the
cheque for Rs.20,000/- issued by the said Kamal Sharma in
favour of the respondent D.K. Gandhi was dishonoured.
(ii) During the course of the said complaint case, the accused
Mr. Sharma agreed to pay the sum of Rs.20,000/- for the
dishonoured cheque besides Rs.5,000/- as the expenses
incurred by the complainant. It was alleged by the respondent
(complainant) that though the appellant had received from the
accused Mr. Sharma the DD/pay order for Rs.20,000/- and
the crossed cheque of Rs.5,000/- on behalf of the respondent,
the appellant did not deliver the same to the respondent and
instead demanded Rs.5,000/- in cash from the respondent.
The appellant also filed a suit for recovery of Rs.5,000/- in the
court of Small Causes, Delhi raising a plea that the sum was
due to him as his fees. Subsequently, the appellant gave the
DD/pay order for Rs.20,000/- and cheque for Rs.5,000/- to the
respondent, however, the payment of cheque for Rs.5,000/-
was stopped by the accused Mr. Sharma at the instance of the
appellant. The respondent therefore filed a complaint before the
District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Delhi seeking
compensation of Rs. 15,000/- in addition to the amount of
cheque of Rs.5,000/-, as also Rs.10,000/- for the mental agony
and harassment along with the cost. The appellant resisted
the said complaint by filing a reply on 03.03.1998 raising a
preliminary objection to the effect that the District Consumer
Forum had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute raised in
the complaint as the Advocates were not covered under the
provisions contained in the CP Act.
(iii) The District Forum, however, rejected the said preliminary
objection, holding that it had the jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the dispute between the parties and further decided the
complaint in favour of the respondent. The appellant being
aggrieved by the said order had filed an appeal before the State
Commission, which by the order dated 10.03.2006 allowed the
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 495
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
same holding that the services of lawyers/advocates did not
fall within the ambit of “service” defined under section 2(1)(o)
of the CP Act, 1986. The NCDRC, however in the Revision
Application preferred by the respondent passed the impugned
order as stated hereinabove.
(iv) Being aggrieved by the said impugned order passed by the
NCDRC, the present set of appeals has been filed by the Bar of
Indian Lawyers, Delhi High Court Bar Association, Bar Council
of India, and by the appellant M. Mathias.
SUBMISSIONS
4. Since the issues involved in this batch of Appeals pertain to the
Advocates practising in the various courts/tribunals and other legal
forums of the country, a wide range of arguments were advanced
before us. Having regard to the significance and sensitivity of the
issues involved, we had appointed the learned Senior Advocate, Mr.
V. Giri as an Amicus Curiae to assist the Court.
5. The broad submissions made by the learned Senior Counsels Mr.
Narender Hooda, Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, Mr. Manoj Swarup, Mr.
Manan Mishra, Mr. Jaideep Gupta, Mr. Shekhar Naphade, Mr. Vikas
Singh and learned counsel, Mr. D.K. Sharma may be summarized
as under: -
(i) The Advocates Act, 1961 is a law dealing exclusively with the
legal profession which provides a robust mechanism laying
down professional standards for compliance and for determining
professional misconduct.
(ii) The legal profession is a noble profession and not a business
or trade. It is an extension of system of justice, and the success
of judicial process depends on the independence of the Bar.
Hence, its autonomy is needed to preserve the democracy and
to keep judiciary strong.
(iii) A unique feature which distinguishes an Advocate from other
professional is that an Advocate has a duty to the court and
his peers, in addition to his duty to the client. He is not mere
a mouthpiece but he has to exercise his own judgment for
upholding the interest of his client by all fair, legal and reasonable
means, and by being respectful to the court.
496 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(iv) The Bar Council of India and State Bar Councils are invested
with the disciplinary powers. An error of judgment or mere
negligence may not be a professional misconduct. In any
case, the professional misconduct which subsumes cases of
negligence, which is covered by the special law i.e., Advocates
Act, 1961.
(v) The Advocates Act being special law would prevail over the CP
Act so far as the conduct of Advocates are concerned.
(vi) The law of negligence recognizes that a professional would
be held liable in a civil action for negligence and includes
professionals of varied fields who possess special skill in that
profession generally.
(vii) The legal professionals in United Kingdom can be sued for
negligence by a way of regular civil action, however they would
not be liable under the law dealing with consumer rights for
trade/commercial activities.
(viii) Allowing consumer protection law to apply to the Advocates
would open floodgates of unnecessary litigations and it would
not be in the larger public interest to do so. It would also lead
to multiple proceedings before multiple forums, reagitation of
issues decided by a judicial body including the Supreme Court
with potentially conflicting decisions.
(ix) The summary nature of proceeding under the consumer
protection law with its accent on inexpensive and speedy
remedy (though enacted with laudable objects for protection
of consumers against trade and commercial activities), can
become an easy tool for disgruntled litigants to knock at the
doors of the consumer forums against the advocates. It would
lead to speculative/vexatious claims, rather than seeking
relief in respect of bona fide grievances against professional
misconduct.
(x) The legal profession is recognized as sui generis and stands
out among other profession due to its distinctive nature, where
the lawyers often find themselves operating in an environment
where control is elusive. Unlike many other professions where
practitioners may have a higher degree of control over their
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 497
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
surroundings, the lawyers frequently navigate through complex
legal landscapes shaped by diverse factors.
(xi) One of the primary distinctions of legal profession is the in-
herent complexity of legal issues. Lawyers must grapple with
intricate statutes, case laws and regulatory frameworks, which
often lack definitive answers. Legal disputes frequently involve
multiple parties with conflicting interests, further complicating
the matters. Unlike some other professions where problems
may have more straightforward solutions, the lawyers often
face ambiguity and uncertainty in their work, making control
over outcomes elusive.
(xii) The adversarial dynamics have an element of unpredictability, as
outcomes depend not only on the lawyer’s skill and knowledge
but also on the strategies employed by opposing counsel and
the decisions of judges.
(xiii) Lawyers are bound by ethical and professional obligations that
constrain their autonomy and control over their work. Adherence
to the codes of conduct, client confidentiality, and obligations
to the court limit the freedom of lawyers to act solely in their
own interest or according to their preferences.
(xiv) Unlike any other profession, where professionals are in
control of their surrounding fully, legal profession is the sole
profession, where advocates have no control over their en-
vironment. The environment they work in is controlled by the
presiding Judge.
(xv) The Bar Council of India Rules prescribe at least four sets of
duty that a lawyer has to oblige, viz., Duty to the Court, Duty
to the Client, Duty to Opponent and Duty to Colleagues, in
no particular order. These duties are sometimes conflicting in
nature, however whenever a conflict arises, the duty to court
is considered to be paramount.
(xvi) Unlike the medical profession, where scientific standards exist
to decide the standard of care, there is no universal standard
of care or objective test that exists or can be prescribed as the
threshold in the case of legal profession to adjudicate upon the
question of abdication of duty to care.
498 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(xvii) Distinguishing the decision of this Court in Indian Medical
Association vs. V.P. Shantha & Others1, it was sought to
be submitted that there is a fundamental difference between
the practice of law and the practice of medicine, as also the
difference in the nature of professional-client relationship.
The complexity of legal issues, and the diversity of legal
contexts also would take the legal services rendered by
the Advocates outside the purview of the services defined
under the CP Act.
6. The learned Senior Advocate Mr. V. Giri - Amicus Curiae, submitted
that the Advocates can be broadly classified into two categories
based on the terms of their engagement and the nature of work
being done by them for their clients – (1) Advocates engaged by
clients to conduct their cases and then represent them before any
court, tribunal or other forum, on the strength of a vakalatnama
and (2) Advocates engaged by clients to provide their professional
expertise for providing legal opinions, issuing legal notices, drafting
agreements, etc. He submitted that the first category of advocates
would not come within the purview of a service provider under the
CP Act, as in that case the advocate acts as a representative or
agent of the client. He further submitted that it is open to a party to
plead and appear in person in the court, however when he executes
a vakalatnama, he chooses to engage an Advocate as his agent,
and the acts and statements of the advocate, in the course of his
duties in the matter, are like the acts and statements of the principal
i.e., the client himself. Such relationship cannot be equated to that
of a “service provider” and a “consumer” as contemplated in the
CP Act. However, the Amicus Curiae Mr. Giri fairly submitted that
in the second category of Advocates i.e., the Advocates who are
engaged by the clients outside the precincts of the court and outside
the litigation process i.e., who are not engaged on the strength of a
vakalatnama but engaged to provide legal services outside the court
process, would come within the purview of a service provider, and
any deficiency or shortcoming in the professional services rendered
by such Advocates, completely outside the confines of the litigation
process, would be covered under the CP Act.

ANALYSIS
7. Though the question posed before us is, whether a complaint
alleging “deficiency in service” against Advocates practising Legal
Profession, would be maintainable under the Consumer Protection
Act, having regard to the entire spectrum and scheme of the said
Act, following further questions stem from the said question, which
deserve consideration.
(i) Whether the Legislature ever intended to include the Professions
or services rendered by the Professionals within the purview
of the CP Act 1986 as re-enacted in 2019?
(ii) Whether the Legal Profession is sui generis?
(iii) Whether a Service hired or availed of an Advocate could be
said to be the service under “a contract of personal service”
so as to exclude it from the definition of “Service” contained in
Section 2 (42) of the CP Act 2019?
8. For adverting to the first question, whether the Legislature ever
intended to include the Professions or the services rendered by the
Professionals within the purview of the CP Act 1986 as re-enacted
in 2019, it would be germane to ascertain the legislative intention
and to look back to the history, object and purpose of enacting the
CP Act 1986. A three-Judge Bench in case of State of Karnataka
vs. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society and Others2,
while dealing with the issue raised about the constitutional validity
of the CP Act 1986, had elaborately considered the history, objects
and purpose of enacting the said Act.
“5. Before adverting to the question as regard the
competence of Parliament to enact the said Act, we may
notice the history of legislation leading to enactment of
the said Act.
6. The Secretary General, United Nations submitted draft
guidelines for consumer protection to the Economic and
Social Council (UNESCO) in 1983. The General Assembly
of the United Nations upon extensive discussions and
2 [2003] 1 SCR 397 : (2003) 2 SCC 412
500 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
negotiations among governments on this scope and content
thereof adopted the guidelines which inter alia provide for
the following:
“Taking into account the interests and needs of consumers
in all countries, particularly those in developing countries,
recognizing that consumers often face imbalances in
economic terms, educational level, and bargaining power,
and bearing in mind that consumer should have the right
of access to non-hazardous products, as well as the
importance of promoting just, equitable and sustainable
economic and social development, these guidelines for
consumer protection have the following objectives:
(a) To assist countries in achieving or maintaining
adequate protection for their population as consumers.
(b) To facilitate production and distribution patterns
responsive to the needs and desires of consumers.
(c) To encourage high levels of ethical conduct for those
engaged in the production and distribution of goods
and services to consumers.
(d) To assist countries in curbing abusive business
practices by all enterprises at the national
and international levels which adversely affect
consumers.
(e) To facilitate the development of independent
consumer groups.
(f) To further international cooperation in the field of
consumer protection.
(g) To encourage the development of market conditions
which provide consumers with greater choice at
lower prices.”
7. The framework for the Consumer Act was provided by a
resolution dated 9-4-1985 of the General Assembly of the
United Nations Organisation. This is known as “Consumer
Protection Resolution No. 39/248”. India is a signatory to
the said Resolution.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 501
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
8. The said Act was enacted having regard to the
aforementioned Resolution.
9. It seeks to provide for better protection of the interests
of consumers and for the said purpose, to make provision
for the establishment of Consumer Councils and other
authorities for the settlement of consumer disputes and
for matters connected therewith, as would appear from the
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act.
10. It further seeks inter alia to promote and protect the
rights of consumers such as—
""(a) The right to be protected against marketing of goods
which are hazardous to life and property;
(b) the right to be informed about the quality, quantity,
potency, purity, standard and price of goods to protect
the consumer against unfair trade practices;
(c) the right to be assured, wherever possible, access
to variety of goods at competitive prices;
(d) the right to be heard and to be assured that
consumers’ interests will receive due consideration
at appropriate forums;
(e) the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practice
or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers; and
(f) right to consumer education.””
9. The scope and object of the said legislation had also come up for
consideration before this Court in Common Cause, A Registered
Society vs. Union of India and Others3 in which it was observed: -
“2. The object of the legislation, as the Preamble of the
Act proclaims, is “for better protection of the interests
of consumers”. During the last few years preceding the
enactment there was in this country a marked awareness
among the consumers of goods that they were not getting
their money’s worth and were being exploited by both
3 [1993] 1 SCR 10 : (1997) 10 SCC 729
502 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
traders and manufacturers of consumer goods. The need
for consumer redressal fora was, therefore, increasingly
felt. Understandably, therefore, legislation was introduced
and enacted with considerable enthusiasm and fanfare
as a path-breaking benevolent legislation intended to
protect the consumer from exploitation by unscrupulous
manufacturers and traders of consumer goods. A three-tier
fora comprising the District Forum, the State Commission
and the National Commission came to be envisaged under
the Act for redressal of grievances of consumers….”
10. In Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta4, it was
observed in paragraph 2 as under: -
“2. ……To begin with the preamble of the Act, which
can afford useful assistance to ascertain the legislative
intention, it was enacted, ‘to provide for the protection of
the interest of consumers. Use of the word ‘protection’
furnishes key to the minds of makers of the Act. Various
definitions and provisions which elaborately attempt to
achieve this objective have to be construed in this light
without departing from the settled view that a preamble
cannot control otherwise plain meaning of a provision. In
fact the law meets long felt necessity of protecting the
common man from such wrongs for which the remedy
under ordinary law for various reasons has become illusory.
Various legislations and regulations permitting the State
to intervene and protect interest of the consumers have
become a haven for unscrupulous ones as the enforcement
machinery either does not move or it moves ineffectively,
inefficiently and for reasons which are not necessary to be
stated. The importance of the Act lies in promoting welfare
of the society by enabling the consumer to participate
directly in the market economy. It attempts to remove
the helplessness of a consumer which he faces against
powerful business, described as, ‘a network of rackets’
or a society in which, ‘producers have secured power’
to ‘rob the rest’ and the might of public bodies which are

degenerating into storehouses of inaction where papers
do not move from one desk to another as a matter of duty
and responsibility but for extraneous consideration leaving
the common man helpless, bewildered and shocked.…..”
11. Yet in Laxmi Engineering Works vs. P.S.G. Industrial Institute5,
it was held in paragraph 10 as under: -
“10. A review of the provisions of the Act discloses that the
quasi-judicial bodies/authorities/agencies created by the
Act known as District Forums, State Commissions and the
National Commission are not courts though invested with
some of the powers of a civil court. They are quasi-judicial
tribunals brought into existence to render inexpensive and
speedy remedies to consumers. It is equally clear that
these forums/commissions were not supposed to supplant
but supplement the existing judicial system. The idea was
to provide an additional forum providing inexpensive and
speedy resolution of disputes arising between consumers
and suppliers of goods and services. The forum so
created is uninhibited by the requirement of court fee
or the formal procedures of a court. Any consumer can
go and file a complaint. Complaint need not necessarily
be filed by the complainant himself; any recognized
consumers’ association can espouse his cause. Where
a large number of consumers have a similar complaint,
one or more can file a complaint on behalf of all. Even
the Central Government and State Governments can act
on his/their behalf. The idea was to help the consumers
get justice and fair treatment in the matter of goods and
services purchased and availed by them in a market
dominated by large trading and manufacturing bodies.
Indeed, the entire Act revolves round the consumer and
is designed to protect his interest. The Act provides for
“business-to-consumer” disputes and not for “business-to-
business” disputes. This scheme of the Act, in our opinion,
is relevant to and helps in interpreting the words that fall
for consideration in this appeal.”
5 [1995] 3 SCR 174 : (1995) 3 SCC 583
504 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
12. Thus, considering the intention of the Legislature, the objects and
reasons of the Act of 1986 it was repeatedly held that the said Act
was enacted to provide for the better protection of the interests
of the consumers against their exploitation by the traders and
manufacturers of the consumer goods, and to help consumers in
getting justice and fair treatment in the matter of goods and services
purchased and availed by them in a market dominated by large
trading and manufacturing bodies.
13. After several years of passing of the CP Act 1986, still many
shortcomings in the said Act were noticed while administering various
provisions of the said Act. Hence, the CP Act 1986 was repealed and
the CP Act, 2019 came to be re-enacted. The statement of objects
and reasons for re-enacting the said Act of 2019 reads as under:-
“1. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (68 of 1986) was
enacted to provide for better protection of the interests of
consumers and for the purpose of making provision for
establishment of consumer protection councils and other
authorities for the settlement of consumer disputes, etc.
Although, the working of the consumer dispute redressal
agencies has served the purpose to a considerable extent
under the said Act, the disposal of cases has not been
fast due to various constraints. Several shortcomings have
been noticed while administering the various provisions
of the said Act.
2. Consumer markets for goods and services have
undergone drastic transformation since the enactment of
the Consumer Protection Act in 1986. The modern market
place contains a plethora of products and services. The
emergence of global supply chains, rise in international
trade and the rapid development of e-commerce have led
to new delivery systems for goods and services and have
provided new options and opportunities for consumers.
Equally, this has rendered the consumer vulnerable
to new forms of unfair trade and unethical business
practices. Misleading advertisements, tele- marketing,
multi-level marketing, direct selling and e-commerce pose
new challenges to consumer protection and will require
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 505
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
appropriate and swift executive interventions to prevent
consumer detriment. Therefore, it has become inevitable
to amend the Act to address the myriad and constantly
emerging vulnerabilities of the consumers. In view of this,
it is proposed to repeal and re-enact the Act.”
14. It is trite to say that a reference to statement of objects and reasons
is permissible for understanding the background, the antecedent
state of affairs, the surrounding circumstances in relation to the
statute, and the evil which the statute had sought to remedy.* As
discernible from the statement of objects and reasons for re-enacting
the CP Act, 2019, there were certain shortcomings found in the CP
Act 1986 while administering the said Act, and at the same time,
due to the emergence of global supply chains, rise in international
trade and rapid development of e-commerce leading to new systems
for goods and services, new options and opportunities had become
available to the consumers. However, new forms of unfair trade
and unethical business practices also came to be developed, which
made the consumers more vulnerable. Misleading advertisements,
telemarketing, multi-level marketing, e-commerce posed new
challenges, which necessitated the Legislature to re-enact the Act.
15. There was not a whisper in the statement of objects and reasons
either of the CP Act, 1986 or 2019 to include the Professions or the
Services provided by the Professionals like Advocates, Doctors etc.
within the purview of the Act. It is very well accepted proposition
of the fact that Professionals could not be called Businessmen
or Traders, nor Clients or Patients be called Consumers. It is
also required to be borne in mind that the terms ‘business’ or
‘trade’ having a commercial aspect involved, could not be used
interchangeably with the term ‘Profession’ which normally would
involve some branch of learning or science. Profession as such
would require knowledge of an advanced type in a given field of
learning or science, or learning gained by a prolonged course
of specialized study. As per Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th Edition,
“Profession” means “a vocation requiring advanced education and
training; especially one of the three traditional Professions- Law,
Medicine and the Ministry.” “Professional” means “someone who
* State of West Bengal vs. Subodh Gopal Bose & Others, AIR 1954 SC 92
506 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
belongs to a learned profession or whose occupation requires a
high level of training and proficiency.”
16. According to Rupert M. Jackson and John L. Powell,* the Occupations
which are regarded as Professions have four characteristics, viz.,
(i) the nature of the work which is skilled and specialized and a
substantial part is mental rather than manual;
(ii) commitment to moral principles which go beyond the general
duty of honesty and a wider duty to community which may
transcend the duty to a particular client or patient;
(iii) professional association which regulates admission and seeks
to uphold the standards of the profession through professional
codes on matters of conduct and ethics; and
(iv) high status in the community.
17. As observed in Indian Medical Association (supra) :-
“22. In the matter of professional liability professions differ
from other occupations for the reason that professions
operate in spheres where success cannot be achieved
in every case and very often success or failure depends
upon factors beyond the professional man’s control. In
devising a rational approach to professional liability which
must provide proper protection to the consumer while
allowing for the factors mentioned above, the approach
of the courts is to require that professional men should
possess a certain minimum degree of competence and
that they should exercise reasonable care in the discharge
of their duties. In general, a professional man owes to
his client a duty in tort as well as in contract to exercise
reasonable care in giving advice or performing services.”
18. In view of the above, a “Profession” would require advanced education
and training in some branch of learning or science. The nature of
work is also skilled and specialised one, substantial part of which
would be mental rather than manual. Therefore, having regard to
the nature of work of a professional, which requires high level of
education, training and proficiency and which involves skilled and
* “Jackson and Powell on Professional Liability” 2nd supplement to the 7th edition
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 507
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
specialized kind of mental work, operating in the specialized spheres,
where achieving success would depend upon many other factors
beyond a man’s control, a Professional cannot be treated equally
or at par with a Businessman or a Trader or a Service provider of
products or goods as contemplated in the CP Act. Similarly, the
services rendered by a Businessman or a Trader to the consumers
with regard to his goods or products cannot be equated with the
Services provided by a Professional to his clients with regard to
his specialized branch of profession. The legislative draftsmen are
presumed to know the law and there is no good reason to assume
that the legislature intended to include the Professions or the
Professionals or the services provided by the professionals within
the ambit of the CP Act. Any interpretation of the Preamble or the
scheme of the Act for construing ‘Profession’ as ‘Business’ or ‘Trade’;
or ‘Professional’ as ‘service provider’ would be extending the scope
of the Act which was not intended, rather would have a counter
productive effect. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the
very purpose and object of the CP Act 1986 as re-enacted in 2019
was to provide protection to the consumers from the unfair trade
practices and unethical business practices only. There is nothing
on record to suggest that the Legislature ever intended to include
the Professions or the Professionals within the purview of the Act.
19. One should also not lose sight of the fact that the other object of the
Act was to provide to the consumers timely and effective administration
and settlement of their disputes. If the services provided by all
the Professionals are also brought within the purview of the Act,
there would be flood-gate of litigations in the commissions/forums
established under the Act, particularly because the remedy provided
under the Act is inexpensive and summary in nature. Consequently,
the very object of providing timely and effective settlement of
consumers’ disputes arising out of the unfair trade and unethical
business practices would be frustrated.
20. We may clarify at this juncture that we do not propose to say that
the professionals could not be sued or held liable for their alleged
misconduct or tortious or criminal acts. In the process of overall
depletion and erosion of ethical values and degradation of the
professional ethics, the instances of professional misconduct are
also on the rise. Undoubtedly, no professional either legal, medical
508 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
or any other professional enjoys any immunity from being sued or
from being held liable for his professional or otherwise misconduct
or other misdeeds causing legal, monetary or other injuries to his
clients or the persons hiring or availing his services. The fact that
professionals are governed by their respective Councils like Bar
Councils or Medical Councils also would not absolve them from their
civil or criminal liability arising out of their professional misconduct
or negligence. Nonetheless, as discussed hereinabove, we are of
the opinion that neither the Professions nor the Professionals were
ever intended to be brought within the purview of the CP Act either
of 1986 or 2019.
21. Of course, we are conscious of the decision in Indian Medical
Association vs. V.P. Shantha & Others (supra), in which a three-
Judge Bench of this Court has held inter alia that the wide amplitude
of the definition of ‘service’ in the main part of Section 2(1)(o) would
cover the services rendered by Medical Practitioners within the said
Section 2(1)(o). However, in our humble opinion, the said decision
deserves to be revisited having regard to the history, object, purpose
and the scheme of the CP Act and in view of the opinion expressed
by us hereinabove to the effect that neither the “Profession” could
be treated as “business” or “trade” nor the services provided by the
“Professionals” could be treated at par with the services provided
by the Businessmen or the Traders, so as to bring them within the
purview of the CP Act .
22. At this juncture, we may rely upon Order VI Rule 2 of the Supreme
Court Rules which reads as under: -
“ORDER VI, Rule 2.-
Where in the course of the hearing of any cause, appeal
or other proceeding, the Bench considers that the matter
should be dealt with by a larger Bench, it shall refer the
matter to the Chief Justice, who shall thereupon constitute
such a Bench for the hearing of it.”
23. The said Rule has been interpreted in Triveniben vs. State of
Gujarat6, in which it has been observed that: -
6 [1989] 1 SCR 509 : (1989) 1 SCC 678
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 509
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
“35. This is undoubtedly a salutary rule, but it appears to
have only a limited operation. It apparently governs the
procedure of a smaller Bench when it disagrees with the
decision of a larger Bench. If the Bench in the course of
hearing of any matter considers that the matter should be
dealt with by a larger Bench, it shall refer the matter to
the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice shall then constitute
a larger Bench for disposal of the matter. This exercise
seems to be unnecessary when a larger Bench considers
that a decision of a smaller Bench is incorrect unless a
constitutional question arises”.
24. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the decision of the
three-judge bench, in case of Indian Medical Association vs. V.P.
Shantha (supra) deserves to be revisited and considered by a larger
bench. We, therefore refer the matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice
of India for His Lordship’s consideration.
25. This takes us to the next question. Even if, it is held that the CP Act
applies to the “Professions” and the “Professionals,” the next question
that falls for our consideration is whether the Legal Profession is sui
generis or is different from the other Profession, particularly from the
Medical Profession because the NCDRC in the impugned order has
relied upon the decision in case of Indian Medical Association vs.
V.P. Shantha (supra) for bringing the Advocates within the purview
of the CP Act.
26. As observed in Byram Pestonji Gariwala vs. Union Bank of India
and Others7, the Indian legal system is the product of history. It is
rooted in our soil; nurtured and nourished by our culture, languages
and traditions; fostered and sharpened by our genius and quest for
social justice; reinforced by history and heritage. After the attainment
of independence and the adoption of the Constitution of India,
judicial administration and the constitution of the law courts remained
fundamentally unchanged. The concept, structure and organisation of
courts, the substantive and procedural laws, the adversarial system
of trial and other proceedings and the function of judges and lawyers
remained basically unaltered and rooted in the common law traditions
7 [1991] Supp. 1 SCR 187 : (1992) 1 SCC 31
510 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in contradistinction to those prevailing in the civil law or other systems
of law. Resultantly, the role, status and capacity of an advocate to
represent his client has also remained by and large unaltered.
27. This Court in R. Muthukrishnan vs. Registrar General, High
Court of Judicature at Madras8, delineating the unique nature of
the legal profession and of the services rendered by the lawyers,
observed thus:
“16. The legal profession cannot be equated with any
other traditional professions. It is not commercial in nature
and is a noble one considering the nature of duties to be
performed and its impact on the society. The independence
of the Bar and autonomy of the Bar Council has been
ensured statutorily in order to preserve the very democracy
itself and to ensure that judiciary remains strong. Where
the Bar has not performed the duty independently and
has become a sycophant that ultimately results in the
denigrating of the judicial system and judiciary itself. There
cannot be existence of a strong judicial system without
an independent Bar.
17. It cannot be gainsaid that lawyers have contributed in
the struggle for independence of the nation. They have
helped in the framing of the Constitution of India and
have helped the courts in evolving jurisprudence by doing
hard labour and research work. The nobility of the legal
system is to be ensured at all costs so that the Constitution
remains vibrant and to expand its interpretation so as to
meet new challenges.
18. It is basically the lawyers who bring the cause to the
Court are supposed to protect the rights of individuals of
equality and freedom as constitutionally envisaged and
to ensure the country is governed by the rule of law.
Considering the significance of the Bar in maintaining the
rule of law, right to be treated equally and enforcement of
various other fundamental rights, and to ensure that various
8 [2019] 1 SCR 589 : (2019) 16 SCC 407
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 511
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
institutions work within their parameters, its independence
becomes imperative and cannot be compromised. The
lawyers are supposed to be fearless and independent
in the protection of rights of litigants. What lawyers are
supposed to protect, is the legal system and procedure
of law of deciding the cases.
19. Role of the Bar in the legal system is significant. The
Bar is supposed to be the spokesperson for the judiciary
as Judges do not speak. People listen to the great
lawyers and people are inspired by their thoughts. They
are remembered and quoted with reverence. It is the duty
of the Bar to protect honest Judges and not to ruin their
reputation and at the same time to ensure that corrupt
Judges are not spared. However, lawyers cannot go to
the streets or go on strike except when democracy itself
is in danger and the entire judicial system is at stake. In
order to improve the system, they have to take recourse
to the legally available methods by lodging complaint
against corrupt Judges to the appropriate administrative
authorities and not to level such allegation in the public.
Corruption is intolerable in the judiciary.
20. The Bar is an integral part of the judicial administration.
In order to ensure that judiciary remains an effective tool,
it is absolutely necessary that the Bar and the Bench
maintain dignity and decorum of each other. The mutual
reverence is absolutely necessary. The Judges are to be
respected by the Bar, they have in turn equally to respect
the Bar, observance of mutual dignity, decorum of both
is necessary and above all they have to maintain self-
respect too.
21. It is the joint responsibility of the Bar and the Bench
to ensure that equal justice is imparted to all and that
nobody is deprived of justice due to economic reasons or
social backwardness. The judgment rendered by a Judge
is based upon the dint of hard work and quality of the
arguments that are advanced before him by the lawyers.
There is no room for arrogance either for a lawyer or for
a Judge.
512 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
22. There is a fine balance between the Bar and the
Bench that has to be maintained as the independence of
the Judges and judiciary is supreme. The independence
of the Bar is on equal footing, it cannot be ignored and
compromised and if lawyers have the fear of the judiciary or
from elsewhere, that is not conducive to the effectiveness
of the judiciary itself, that would be self-destructive.”
28. In State of U.P and Others vs. U.P. State Law Officers Association
and Others9, it was observed thus: -
“14. Legal profession is essentially a service-oriented
profession. The ancestor of today›s lawyer was no more
than a spokesman who rendered his services to the needy
members of the society by articulating their case before
the authorities that be. The services were rendered without
regard to the remuneration received or to be received.
With the growth of litigation, lawyering became a full-time
occupation and most of the lawyers came to depend upon
it as the sole source of livelihood. The nature of the service
rendered by the lawyers was private till the Government
and the public bodies started engaging them to conduct
cases on their behalf.”
29. It is thus well recognized in catena of decisions that the legal
profession cannot be equated with any other traditional professions.
It is not commercial in nature but is essentially a service oriented,
noble profession. It cannot be gainsaid that the role of Advocates
is indispensable in the Justice Delivery System. An evolution of
jurisprudence to keep our Constitution vibrant is possible only with the
positive contribution of the Advocates. The Advocates are expected
to be fearless and independent for protecting the rights of citizens, for
upholding the Rule of law and also for protecting the Independence
of Judiciary. People repose immense faith in the Judiciary, and the
Bar being an integral part of the Judicial System has been assigned
a very crucial role for preserving the independence of the Judiciary,
and in turn the very democratic set up of the Nation. The Advocates
9 [1994] 1 SCR 348 : (1994) 2 SCC 204
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 513
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
are perceived to be the intellectuals amongst the elites and social
activists amongst the downtrodden. That is the reason they are
expected to act according to the principles of uberrima fides i.e.,
the utmost good faith, integrity, fairness and loyalty while handling
the legal proceedings of his client. Being a responsible officer of the
court and an important adjunct of the administration of justice, an
Advocate owes his duty not only to his client but also to the court
as well as to the opposite side.
30. The legal profession is different from the other professions also for
the reason that what the Advocates do, affects not only an individual
but the entire administration of justice, which is the foundation of the
civilized society. It must be remembered that the legal profession is
a solemn and serious profession. It has always been held in very
high esteem because of the stellar role played by the stalwarts
in the profession to strengthen the judicial system in the country.
Their services in making the judicial system efficient, effective and
credible, and in creating a strong and impartial Judiciary, which is
one of the three pillars of the Democracy, could not be compared
with the services rendered by other professionals. Therefore,
having regard to the role, status and duties of the Advocates as
the professionals, we are of the opinion that the legal profession is
sui generis i.e unique in nature and cannot be compared with any
other profession.
31. The next question that falls for our consideration is whether a service
hired or availed of an Advocate could be said to be the service under
a “contract of personal service?”
32. At the outset, it may be stated that in the Indian Courts, various
sobriquets or epithets like pleaders, advocates, lawyers, vakils,
counsels, attorneys etc. are being used interchangeably to describe
the Legal Practitioners, may be because various Acts like Legal
Practitioners Act, 1879, Bombay Pleaders Act, 1920, Indian Bar
Councils Act, 1926 were in force during pre-independence era.
However, on the Advocates Act, 1961 having come into force, the
provisions of the said Acts stood repealed as per Section 50 of the
Advocates Act. The Advocates Act 1961 was enacted to amend and
consolidate the law relating to legal practitioners and to provide for
the constitution of Bar Councils and an All-India Bar.
514 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
33. The Advocates Act defines “Advocate” separately from “Legal
Practitioner” -
“2(1)(a) - “advocate” means an advocate entered in any
roll under the provision of this Act;”
Section 2(1)(i) defines “legal practitioner’ as under: -
“2(1)(i) - “Legal Practitioner” means an advocate or vakil
of any High Court, a pleader, mukhtar or revenue agent;”
34. Advocate is included in the definition of “Legal Practitioner” but legal
practitioner is not included in the definition of “Advocate.” Advocate
is one who has been entered in any roll under the provisions of the
Advocates Act. If we glean over the provisions of the Advocates
Act, 1961, it appears that the said Act was enacted to amend and
consolidate the law relating to legal practitioners and to provide for
the constitution of Bar Councils and an All-India Bar. As per Section
16 thereof, there are only two classes of Advocates, namely Senior
Advocates and other Advocates. As per Section 29, there is only
one class of persons entitled to practice the profession of law,
namely Advocates, and as per Section 30, every advocate whose
name is entered in the State roll is entitled as of right to practice in
all Courts including the Supreme Court and before any Tribunal or
any other authority or person before whom such advocate is by or
under any law for the time being in force entitled to practice. The
disciplinary powers for taking action against the Advocates and
impose punishment for their misconduct have been conferred upon
the State Bar Councils and Bar Council of India as the case may be
under the Chapter V of the Advocates Act. The Bar Council of India
Rules framed under the Advocates Act lay down the restrictions on the
Senior Advocates, and also lay down the standards of professional
conduct and etiquette, which include the duties of the advocate
to the Court, to the client, to the opponent and to the colleagues.
Thus, comprehensive provisions are contained in the Advocates
Act, 1961 and the Bar Council of India Rules framed thereunder,
to take care of the professional misconduct of the Advocates, and
prescribing the punishments if they are found guilty of professional
or other misconduct by the Disciplinary Committees of the State Bar
Council or the Bar Council of India as the case may be.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 515
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
35. In the light of the above provisions of the Advocates Act, let us
consider some of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act
1986/2019. The definition of “Service” contained in Section 2(1)(o)
of the CP Act 1986 and in Section 2(42) of the CP Act 2019 is the
same which reads as under: -
“Service means service of any description which is made
available to potential users and includes, but not limited
to, the provision of facilities in connection with banking,
financing, insurance, transport, processing, supply of
electrical or other energy, telecom, boarding or lodging
or both, housing construction, entertainment, amusement
or the purveying of news or other information, but does
not include the rendering of any service free of charge
or under a contract of personal service.”
36. There is slight difference in the definition of ‘Deficiency’ in Section
2(1)(g) of 1986 Act and Section 2(11) of 2019 Act. The same is
reproduced as under: -
Section 2(1)(g) of CP Act, 1986:-
“Section 2(1) (g) -”Deficiency” means any fault imperfection,
shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and
manner of performance which is required to be maintained
by or under any law for the time being in force or has been
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of
a contract or otherwise in relation to any service.”
Section 2(11) of CP Act, 2019:-
Section 2(11) - “Deficiency “ means any fault, imperfection,
shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature and
manner of performance which is required to be maintained
by or under any law for the time being in force or has been
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance
of a contract or otherwise in relation to any service and
includes-
(i) any act of negligence or omission or commission
by such person which causes loss or injury to the
consumer; and
516 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(ii) deliberate withholding of relevant information by such
person to the consumer”
37. As can be seen, the definition of ‘service’ is divided into three parts
– the first part is explanatory in nature and defines service to mean
service of any description which is made available to the potential
users; the second part is inclusionary part, which expressly includes
the provision of facilities in connection with the specific services;
and the third part is exclusionary part which excludes rendering of
any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service.
Therefore, let us consider whether the service rendered by the
Advocates practising Legal Profession could be said to be the Service
under “a contract of personal service,” so as to exclude it from the
definition of “Service” contemplated under the Act.
38. The question as to whether a given relationship should be classified
as a contract ‘for services’ as opposed to a contract ‘of service’
[i.e. contract ‘of personal service’] is a vexed question of law and
is incapable of being answered with exactitude without reference to
the underlying facts in any given case. This Court in Dharangadhra
Chemical Works Ltd. vs. State of Saurashtra and Others10,
recognized this position of law and held that “the correct method of
approach, therefore, would be to consider whether having regard
to the nature of the work there was due control and supervision by
the employer”. In the words of Fletcher Moulton, L.J. at P.549 in
Simmons v. Heath Laundry Company [(1924) 1 KB 762] which were
cited with approval in Dharangadhra Chemcial Works Ltd. (supra):
“In my opinion it is impossible to lay down any rule of law
distinguishing the one from the other. It is a question of
fact to be decided by all the circumstances of the case.
The greater the amount of direct control exercised over the
person rendering the services by the person contracting
for them the stronger the grounds for holding it to be a
contract of service, and similarly the greater the degree of
independence of such control the greater the probability
that the services rendered are of the nature of professional
services and that the contract is not one of service.”

39. What is sought to be opined in the above cases is that the greater
the amount of direct control exercised over the person rendering
the services by the person contracting for them, the stronger would
be the grounds for holding it to be a “contract of service.” Hence,
let us see whether in case of Advocate-Client relationship, the
client exercises direct control over the Advocate who is rendering
his legal professional services to him. At this stage, it would be
beneficial to refer to some of the important provisions of Code of
Civil Procedure, which pertain to the representation of party-litigant
through Advocates. Order III of CPC pertains to the Recognized
Agents and Pleaders. As per the definition of “Pleader” contained
in Section 2 (15) CPC, ‘Pleader means any person entitled to
appear and plead for another in Court and includes an Advocate,
a Vakil and an Attorney of a High Court. Rule1 of Order III states
that any appearance, application or act in or in any Court may
be made or done by the party in person, or by his recognized
agent or by a pleader appearing, applying or acting, as the case
may be on his behalf. Rule 4 of the said Order III states that no
pleader shall act for any person in any Court, unless he has been
appointed for the purpose by such person by document in writing
signed by such person or by his recognized agent or by some other
person duly authorized by or under a power of attorney to make
such appointment. It further provides that every such appointment
shall be filed in Court and shall for the purposes of sub-rule (1) be
deemed to be in force until determined with the leave of the Court
by writing signed by the client or the pleader as the case may be
and filed in the Court, or until the client or the pleader dies, or until
all proceedings in the suit are ended so far as regards the client.
Such document regarding appointment of a pleader is known in
common parlance as “Vakalatnama”, the proforma of which has
been appended in Form No.19 of the ‘Appendix H’ to CPC. The
said form is reproduced here under: -

40. A conjoint reading of the provisions contained in Order III CPC and
Chapter IV of Advocates Act pertaining to right to practise, there
remains no shadow of doubt that an advocate whose name has
been entered in the State roll is entitled as of right to practise in all
Courts, however he can act for any person in any Court only when
he is appointed by such person by executing the document called
“Vakalatnama.” Such Advocate has certain authorities by virtue of
such “Vakalatnama” but at the same time has certain duties too,
i.e. the duties to the courts, to the client, to the opponent and to
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 519
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
the colleagues as enumerated in the Bar Council of India Rules. In
this regard, this Court in Himalayan Cooperative Group Housing
Society vs. Balwan Singh and Others11 has made very apt
observations, which are reproduced hereunder-
22. Apart from the above, in our view lawyers are perceived
to be their clientʼs agents. The law of agency may not
strictly apply to the client-lawyerʼs relationship as lawyers
or agents, lawyers have certain authority and certain
duties. Because lawyers are also fiduciaries, their duties
will sometimes be more demanding than those imposed
on other agents. The authority-agency status affords the
lawyers to act for the client on the subject-matter of the
retainer. One of the most basic principles of the lawyer-
client relationship is that lawyers owe fiduciary duties to
their clients. As part of those duties, lawyers assume all
the traditional duties that agents owe to their principals
and, thus, have to respect the clientʼs autonomy to make
decisions at a minimum, as to the objectives of the
representation. Thus, according to generally accepted
notions of professional responsibility, lawyers should follow
the clientʼs instructions rather than substitute their judgment
for that of the client. The law is now well settled that a lawyer
must be specifically authorised to settle and compromise
a claim, that merely on the basis of his employment he
has no implied or ostensible authority to bind his client
to a compromise/settlement. To put it alternatively that a
lawyer by virtue of retention, has the authority to choose
the means for achieving the client’s legal goal, while the
client has the right to decide on what the goal will be. If the
decision in question falls within those that clearly belong
to the client, the lawyer’s conduct in failing to consult the
client or in making the decision for the client, is more likely
to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
23. The Bar Council of India Rules, 1975 (for short “the BCI
Rules”), in Part VI Chapter II provide for the “Standards
11 [2015] 4 SCR 616 : (2015) 7 SCC 373
520 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of Professional Conduct and Etiquette” to be observed
by all the advocates under the Advocates Act, 1961 (for
short “the 1961 Act”). In the Preamble to Chapter II, the
BCI Rules provide as follows:
“An advocate shall, at all times, comport himself
in a manner befitting his status as an officer of
the Court, a privileged member of the community,
and a gentleman, bearing in mind that what may
be lawful and moral for a person who is not a
member of the Bar, or for a member of the Bar
in his non-professional capacity may still be
improper for an advocate. Without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing obligation, an
advocate shall fearlessly uphold the interests of
his client and in his conduct conform to the rules
hereinafter mentioned both in letter and in spirit.
The rules hereinafter mentioned contain canons
of conduct and etiquette adopted as general
guides; yet the specific mention thereof shall
not be construed as a denial of the existence of
others equally imperative though not specifically
mentioned.”
24. The Preamble makes it imperative that an advocate
has to conduct himself and his duties in an extremely
responsible manner. They must bear in mind that what
may be appropriate and lawful for a person who is not a
member of the Bar, or for a member of the Bar in his non-
professional capacity, may be improper for an advocate
in his professional capacity.
25. Section II of the said Chapter II provides for duties
of an advocate towards his client. Rules 15 and 19 of
the BCI Rules, have relevance to the subject-matter and
therefore, they are extracted below:
“15. It shall be the duty of an advocate fearlessly
to uphold the interests of his client by all fair
and honourable means without regard to any
unpleasant consequences to himself or any
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 521
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
other. He shall defend a person accused of a
crime regardless of his personal opinion as to
the guilt of the accused, bearing in mind that
his loyalty is to the law which requires that no
man should be convicted without adequate
evidence.
*****
19. An advocate shall not act on the instructions
of any person other than his client or his
authorised agent.”
26. While Rule 15 mandates that the advocate must
uphold the interest of his clients by fair and honourable
means without regard to any unpleasant consequences
to himself or any other. Rule 19 prescribes that an
advocate shall only act on the instructions of his client
or his authorised agent”
41. When we examine the relationship between an Advocate and
his Client from this point of view, the following unique attributes
become clear:
1) Advocates are generally perceived to be their client’s agents
and owe fiduciary duties to their clients.
2) Advocates are fastened with all the traditional duties that
agents owe to their principals. For example, Advocates have to
respect the client’s autonomy to make decisions at a minimum,
as to the objectives of the representation.
3) Advocates are not entitled to make concessions or give any
undertaking to the Court without express instructions from
the Client.
4) It is the solemn duty of an Advocate not to transgress the
authority conferred on him by his Client.
5) An Advocate is bound to seek appropriate instructions from
the Client or his authorized agent before taking any action or
making any statement or concession which may, directly or
remotely, affect the legal rights of the Client.
522 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
6) The Advocate represents the client before the Court and
conducts proceedings on behalf of the client. He is the only link
between the court and the client. Therefore, his responsibility
is onerous. He is expected to follow the instructions of his
client rather than substitute his judgment.
Thus, a considerable amount of direct control is exercised by the
Client over the manner in which an Advocate renders his services
during the course of his employment. All of these attributes
strengthen our opinion that the services hired or availed of an
Advocate would be that of a contract ‘of personal service’ and would
therefore stand excluded from the definition of “service” contained
in the section 2(42) of the CP Act, 2019. As a necessary corollary,
a complaint alleging “deficiency in service” against Advocates
practising Legal Profession would not be maintainable under the
CP Act, 2019.
42. In that view of the matter, we summarize our conclusions as under-
(i) The very purpose and object of the CP Act 1986 as re-enacted
in 2019 was to provide protection to the consumers from unfair
trade practices and unethical business practices, and the
Legislature never intended to include either the Professions or
the services rendered by the Professionals within the purview
of the said Act of 1986/2019.
(ii) The Legal Profession is sui generis i.e. unique in nature and
cannot be compared with any other Profession.
(iii) A service hired or availed of an Advocate is a service under “a
contract of personal service,” and therefore would fall within
the exclusionary part of the definition of “Service” contained
in Section 2 (42) of the CP Act 2019.
(iv) A complaint alleging “deficiency in service” against Advocates
practising Legal Profession would not be maintainable under
the CP Act, 2019.
43. The impugned judgment passed by the NCDRC is set aside. The
Appeals stand allowed accordingly.
44. Before parting, we appreciate and place on record the valuable
assistance and services rendered by the learned Senior Advocate
Mr. V. Giri appointed as an Amicus Curiae in these matters.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 523
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
Pankaj Mithal, J.
1. The moot question which emanates from the proceedings at hand,
if put in a different way, is whether the legal services of the lawyer
availed of by the client would be covered under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 (now Consumer Protection Act, 2019).
2. It is well recognized that the profession of law is a noble profession
having an element of duty towards the court. Lawyers perform
multi-faceted duties. They not only have a duty towards the client
or their opponents but they have a paramount duty to assist the
court as well. In a way, they are officers as well as ambassadors
of the court. Thus, in rendering such kind of a duty to enable
the courts to come to a just conclusion, it may be possible that
at times, the lawyers may earn displeasure of the client while
assisting the court.
3. The profession of law, as such, is regarded as sui generis i.e. which
is unique. It is distinct from all other professions and is one of its
own kind.
4. It is in the above context that we have to examine if the legislature
in enacting the Consumer Protection Act intended to include the
services rendered by professionals, particularly by lawyers to their
clients, within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act.
5. The laws intended to protect consumers, as opposed to traders are
comparatively of recent origin.
6. The General Assembly of United Nations upon extensive discussions
with Governments of various nations submitted draft guidelines for
consumer protection to the United Nations Economic and Social
Council (UNESCO) in the year 1983 inter alia providing for the
following:
a) To assist countries in achieving or maintaining adequate
protection for their population as consumers;
b) To facilitate production and distribution patterns responsive to
the needs and desires of the consumers;
c) To encourage high levels of ethical conduct for those engaged
in the production and distribution of goods and services to
consumers;
524 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
d) To assist countries in curbing abusive business practices by
all enterprises at the national and international levels which
adversely affect consumers;
e) To facilitate the development of independent consumer groups;
f) To further international cooperation in the field of consumer
protection;
g) To encourage the development of market conditions which
provide consumers with greater choice at lower prices;
7. A bare reading of the above guidelines reveals that the same have been
formulated taking into account the interests and needs of consumers
in various countries, particularly developing countries, in order to level
out economic imbalances between consumers and service providers.
8. The General Assembly of the United Nations Organization by Resolution
No. 39/248 dated 9.4.1985 provided a framework known as Consumer
Protection Resolution to which our country is also a signatory.
9. It is on the basis of the above Consumer Protection Resolution of the
UNO that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 in India was enacted
with the objective to save the consumers from unfair conduct and
practices of traders.
10. In Om Prakash vs. Assistant Engineer, Haryana Agro Industries
Corporation Ltd. and Anr.1 a three Judge Bench vide paragraph
7 described the Objects and Reasons for the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act as under:
“7. From the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
Act, it appears that the purpose of the Act is to protect the
interest of the consumer and to provide ‘the right, to seek
redressal against unfair trade practices or unscrupulous
exploitation of consumers’…”
11. Recently, in Laureate Buildwell (P) Ltd. vs. Charanjeet Singh,2 a
three Judge Bench of this Court, highlighting the objectives of the
Consumer Protection Act held as follows:
1 [1994] 3 SCR 463 : (1994) 3 SCC 504
2 [2021] 6 SCR 673 : (2021) 20 SCC 401
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 525
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
“26. If one also considers the broad objective of the
Consumer Protection Act, which is to provide for better
protection of the interests of consumers and for that
purpose, provide for the establishment of Consumer
Councils and other authorities for the settlement of
consumer disputes and for matters connected therewith,
as evident from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of
the Act. The Statement further seeks inter alia to promote
and protect the rights of consumers such as—
“2. … (a) the right to be protected against marketing of
goods which are hazardous to life and property;
(b) the right to be informed about the quality, quantity,
potency, purity, standard and price of goods to protect the
consumer against unfair trade practices;
(c) the right to be assured, wherever possible, access to
variety of goods at competitive prices;
(d) the right to be heard and to be assured that consumers’
interests will receive due consideration at appropriate
forums;
(e) the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices
or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers; and
(f) right to consumer education.”
12. The idea behind the Consumer Protection Act from 1986 till today
has been to help the consumers get justice and fair treatment in
matters of goods and services purchased and availed of by them
in a market dominated by large trading and manufacturing bodies.
The entire Act revolves around the consumer and is designed to
protect their interests.
13. Leaving aside India for the time being, if we consider the
international practice with regard to the inclusion of lawyer-client
relationships within the ambit of consumer protection laws, we
would notice that the practice of common law countries evidences
the exclusion of lawyers from the umbrella of consumer protection
laws. It must be kept in mind that the consumer protection laws
of almost all countries are based upon the same resolution of
526 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the UNO which forms the foundation for framing the Consumer
Protection Act in India.
14. To illustrate, Consumer Protection Act, 1999 enacted by the Parliament
of Malaysia vide Section 2 (2)(e) specifically provides that the said act
shall not apply, inter alia, to services provided by professionals who
are regulated by any law. It may be worth noting that the services of
the professionals such as lawyers in Malaysia are governed by Legal
Profession Act, 1976. Therefore, by virtue of the above Section 2
(2) (e), the services provided by the professionals such as lawyers
stand excluded from the application of the Consumer Protection Act
of Malaysia.
15. This legislative intent of excluding regulated professions from the
ambit of Consumer Protection Law has been continuing for over
a considerable period of time now. Aspects of such exclusion find
mention in the DIRECTIVE 2011/83/EU OF THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL OF 25 OCTOBER 2011 on
consumer rights where it has been said that provisions of the said
directive should not apply to regulated professions.
16. At the heart of this legislative intent to exempt such ‘regulated
professions’ from the scope of consumer laws lies the fact that such
professions are sui generis and paramount as services of general
interest.
17. The recent DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/958 OF THE EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 28 June 2018 bears a
befitting testimony to this continuing intent of lawmakers and the desire
to safeguard regulated professions from any outside interreference.
18. Similarly, Section 188 of the Consumer Protection Act (Québec)
provides that:
“For the purpose of this division, every person offering
or providing any of the services referred to in section
189 [covering contracts of service] is considered to be a
merchant, except: … (i) persons who are members of a
professional order governed by the Professional Code
(chapter C-26).”
(emphasis supplied)
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 527
Bar of Indian Lawyers Through its President Jasbir Singh Malik v.
D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
19. In a similar vein, States in the USA also exempt legal professionals
from consumer laws.
20. Illustratively, the Code of Maryland, Title 13, dealing with minimum
standards of consumer protection in Maryland, in Subtitle 1 § 13-104
explicitly states that:
“this title does not apply to: (1) The professional services
of a certified public accountant, architect, clergyman,
professional engineer, lawyer….”
(emphasis supplied)
21. The Code of the District of Columbia, while highlighting the powers
of the consumer protection agency in Title 28 Chapter 39 § 28–3903
states in clause (c) that:
“(c) The Department may not: … (2) apply the provisions
of section §28-3905 [Consumer Protection Complaints]
to: … (C) professional services of clergymen, lawyers,
and Christian Science practitioners engaging in their
respective professional endeavors”;
(emphasis supplied)
22. The Australian High Court, the highest court of the land in Australia,
in D’Orta-Ekenaike vs. Victoria Legal Aid3 has emphatically echoed
the need for such exemption and its direct bearing on the justice
delivery system. The reasoning of its majority is instructive and
deserves to be quoted in full:
“84. To remove the advocate’s immunity would make a
significant inroad upon what we have earlier described
as a fundamental and pervading tenet of the judicial
system. That inroad should not be created. There
may be those who will seek to characterize the result at
which the Court arrives in this matter as a case of lawyers
looking after their own, whether because of personal
inclination and sympathy, or for other base motives. But
the legal principle which underpins the Court’s conclusion
3 (2005) 223 CLR 1
528 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is fundamental. Of course, there is always a risk that the
determination of a legal controversy is imperfect. And it
may be imperfect because of what a party’s advocate
does or does not do. The law aims at providing the best
and safest system of determination that is compatible
with human fallibility. But underpinning the system is the
need for certainty and finality of decision. The immunity
of advocates is a necessary consequence of that need”.
(emphasis supplied)
23. It would be trite to mention here that the legal profession is a
regulated profession in India. The Advocates Act, 1961 regulates the
conduct of lawyers in India and is a complete code in itself. Given
the regulation, India also needs to bring the working of its regulated
professions in alignment with international practices.
24. In the era of globalization, though I am conscious that a law has
to be applied in context with the prevailing situation of the country,
nonetheless, to have a uniform application of any law particularly
the one which has been framed on the basis of the common
resolution of the UNO, laws must have a uniform application in all
nations. It is, therefore, essential that the consumer protection laws
in all countries may somewhat have universal application and be
confined to ‘consumers’ only i.e. to the persons who buys any goods
for consideration or hires or avails of any service for consideration,
impliedly excluding the professional services especially that of a
lawyer whose profession is sui generis.
25. In doing so, in India also the services of professionals more particularly
that of lawyers have to be excluded from consumer protection law
in accordance with the intention expressed in enacting the same.
26. With the above additional reasoning supplementing the various
other grounds for excluding the services of the professionals from
the Consumer Protection Act, I am in agreement with the opinion
expressed by my esteemed sister and I am of the view that the
legislature in India as in some other countries, had not intended to
include the services rendered by the professionals especially the
lawyers to their client within the purview of Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 and re-enacted in 2019.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 529

D. K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Anr.
27. Accordingly, the view taken by the NCDRC to the effect that in
respect of deficiency in service rendered by the lawyers, a complaint
in Consumer Protection Act, 1986 would be maintainable, is incorrect
and stands overruled.
28. The impugned order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission dated 06.08.2007 is hereby set aside.
29. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

10 May 2024
[Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Aravind Kumar,* JJ.]","Matter pertains to the maintainability of the complaint, whether the
service obtained by the complainant was for a commercial purpose.
","Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 2(7) – Maintainability of
complaint – Consumer complaint before the district forum
alleging deficiency of service and seeking refund of amount
from the opposite party – Instead of examining whether the
service availed by complainant was for commercial purpose,
the district forum determined whether the complainant fell
within the definition of ‘person’ and holding that there was
‘deficiency in service’, ordered for refund of the claimed
amount with interest – Said order upheld by forums below
without examining the maintainability issue – Maintainability
challenge before this Court, as to whether the service obtained
by complainant was for commercial purpose:
Held: Onus to prove that the service was obtained for a commercial
purpose is on the service provider – Standard of proof has to be
measured against a ‘preponderance of probabilities’ – If and only
if, the service provider discharges its onus of showing that the
service was availed, in fact for a commercial purpose, does the
onus shift back to the complainant to bring its case within the third
part-explanation (a) to s. 2(7) to show that the service was obtained
exclusively for the purpose of earning its livelihood by means of
self-employment – Plea of the opposite party that the complainant
has not pleaded nor proved that the service was obtained for earning
his livelihood through the means of self employment, relates to the
third part of the definition of consumer – Question of inquiring into
the third part would only arise if the service provider succeeds in
crossing the second part by discharging its onus and proving that
* Author
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 215

the service obtained was for a commercial purpose – Unless the
service provider discharges its onus, the onus does not shift back to
the complainant to show that the service obtained was exclusively
for earning its livelihood through the means of self-employment
– On facts, opposite party merely pleaded in its version that the
service was obtained for commercial purpose – No evidence led to
probabilise its case other than merely restating its claim on affidavit
– Plea without proof and proof without plea is no evidence in the
eyes of law, thus, the matter dismissed. [Paras 21-23]
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – Technical pleas – Manner in
which consumer forums must decide the pleas – Plea raised
by service providers that the services obtained/goods bought
was for a commercial purpose and, thus, the complaint filed
on behalf of such persons not maintainable:
Held: Such pleas are decided on the manner in which the issues
are framed – Unless the burden of proof is properly cast on the
relevant party, the consumer forum would not be in a position to
arrive at proper decision – Thus, guidance provided on how the
issues must be framed and the manner in which the evidence
must be appreciated. [Para 19]
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 2(7) – Definition of
consumer – Deconstruction of s. 2(7)(i):
Held: There are three parts to the definition of a consumer – First
part sets out the prerequisites for a person to qualify as a consumer-
there must be purchase of goods, for consideration – Second part is
an ‘exclusion clause’ [‘carve out’] which has the effect of excluding
the person from the definition of a consumer – The carve out applies
if the person has obtained goods for the purpose of ‘resale’ or for a
‘commercial purpose’ – Third part is an exception to the exclusion
clause, it relates to explanation (a) to s. 2(7) which limits the scope
of ‘commercial purpose’, the expression, ‘commercial purpose’
does not include persons who bought goods ‘exclusively for the
purpose of earning his livelihood, by means of self-employment’
– Significance of deconstructing the definition into three parts was
for the purpose of explaining on whom lies the onus to prove each
of the different parts – Onus of proving the first part-person had
bought goods/availed services for a consideration, rests on the
complainant himself – Carve out clause, in the second part, is
invoked by the service providers to exclude the complainants from
availing benefits under the Act – Onus of proving that the person
216 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
falls within the carve out must necessarily rest on the service
provider and not the complainant – Since it is always the service
provider who pleads that the service was obtained for a commercial
purpose, the onus of proving the same would have to be borne by
it – Act is a consumer-friendly and beneficial legislation intended
to address grievances of consumers – Negative burden cannot
be placed on the complainant to show that the service available
was not for a commercial purpose. [Paras 15, 20]

Aravind Kumar, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant (‘OP’/‘service provider’, used interchangeably) has
challenged the order dated 10.03.2021 of the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (NCDRC) in these
appeals. The respondent (complainant) had successfully redressed
its consumer grievance, originally, before the Principal Consumer
Disputes Redressal for Bangalore Urban District, at Bangalore
(‘District Forum’). The service provider was unsuccessful in upsetting
the order of the District Forum before the State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, Bangalore (‘State Forum’) as well as the
NCDRC. That is how this matter has come before us.
3. The service provider is a registered Chit Fund company engaged in
Chit business. Admittedly, the complainant had subscribed to certain
chits in the said business. The subscription was made in the chit
group 53005/Ticket No.9 for a chit value of Rs.1,00,000/- payable at
the rate of Rs.2500/- per month for a period of 40 months.
4. It is the case of the complainant that the OP had illegally stopped
the chit business in the year 1996. The complainant requested
the OP to repay the chit amount deposited until stoppage of the
business. The OP refused to re-pay the subscription amount
since, according to it, the complainant owed certain dues to it and
therefore, it adjusted the subscription amount against pending dues
of the complainant.
5. Initially, the complainant sought to redress its grievance relating
to non-refund of the subscription amount, before the authority
218 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
constituted under the Chit Funds Act 1982.1 Thereafter, the OP filed
WP No.22568/2012 with 9 other connected writ petitions against the
order of the Additional Registrar. Whereas the Complainant also filed
WP No.17045/2014 with 9 other connected writ petitions questioning
the finding with regards to the maintainability under the Chit Funds
Act. On 16.11.2015, the High Court directed the complainant to
approach the Consumer Forum and held that said cases were not
maintainable under the Chit Funds Act.
6. It is against this background that the complaint comes to be filed
before the District Forum alleging that the illegal termination of the
chit fund business and consequent non-refund of the subscription
amount, resulted in deficiency of service. The prayer in the complaint
was for a direction to be issued to the OP to refund Rs.18,750/- along
with future interest at the rate of 18% p.a.
7. In the written version, the OP, apart from contesting the claim on
merits, raised a preliminary objection that the complaint is not
maintainable since the complainant does not qualify the definition
of a ‘consumer’. According to the OP, the service obtained by
the complainant was for a commercial purpose, and by that fact,
the complainant would stand excluded from availing any remedy
under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. To demonstrate that the
service was obtained for a commercial purpose, the OP relied on
two circumstances: (a) the statement in the complainant that there
was an ‘understanding between complainant and opposite party to
promote chit business’; (b) findings2 of an internal audit conducted
by the OP.
1 The complainant had filed 10 cases before the Assistant Registrar of Co-operative Societies i.e., Dispute
No.1062/2004-05 to 1071/2004-05, for recovery of adjusted amount, whereunder the Assistant Registrar
passed an award and directed the OP to pay the amount to complainant. Against the said order OP
unsuccessfully challenged the orders in appeals before Additional Registrar of Co-operative Societies,
Aliaskar Road, Bangalore, in appeal No.33/CAP/2009-10 to No.42/CAP/2009-10. The Additional
Registrar directed the opposite party to pay the award amount on the ground that said chit groups did not
come under the Chit Fund Act.
2 As per the Internal Audit, the Complainant held 1023 prized chits, and 1043 non-prized chits. The report
also mentions various correspondences between the complainant and OP with regards to the increasing
disparity between the total liability of the fund, and the paid-up value of the non-prized chits. As per the
audit report, the balance liability amounted to Rs. 1.86 crores. It was stated that owing non-payment of
outstanding arrears, the foreman in accordance with Section 28 and Section 29 of the Chit Fund Act is
bound to remove the defaulted non-prized subscriber to keep the chit running, hence the defaulted non-
prized tickets maintained by Complainant were removed, and the paid amounts were adjusted against
arrears in the prized chits.

8. Against the said pleadings available on record, the District Forum
proceeded to frame the following issue:
I. Whether the Complainant has proved the alleged deficiency
in service by the Opposite Party?
II. If so, to what relief the Complainant is entitled?
9. There was no specific issue framed on the preliminary question as
to whether the complainant fell within the definition of consumer as
understood under Section 2 (1) (d) of the Act of 1986. However,
the District Forum did address itself, though incorrectly, to the
objection of the OP that the complaint was not maintainable.
Instead of examining whether the service availed on behalf of the
complainant was for a commercial purpose, the District Forum
determined whether the complainant fell within the definition of
a “person” as defined in Section 2 (1)(m) of the Act. On merits, it
found that there was, in fact, ‘deficiency in service’ and ordered
for refund of the claimed amount with interest of 18% p.a.
10. In appeal, the State Forum has cursorily found that the District Forum
was correct in concluding that there was deficiency in service, on
merits. Nothing has been said, however, as regards the challenge
to the maintainability of the complaint even though a specific ground
was taken in the memorandum of appeal towards that end.
11. The NCDRC has agreed with the State Forum and District Forum
on the merits of the issue and found no reason to interfere with the
‘well appraised detailed order’ of the District Forum. It noted that
there was no necessity to reappreciate the evidence de novo since
the forums below had properly appreciated the issue in dispute.
On the maintainability issue, the NCDRC appears to have mirrored
the approach of the District Forum. Instead of examining whether
the service obtained by the complainant was for a ‘commercial
purpose’, it examined the question of whether the complainant
falls within the definition of ‘person’. Neither was such an objection
raised by the OP in the version originally submitted before the
District Forum nor was such a contention orally taken before the
NCDRC. We fail to understand how the NCDRC failed to grasp
the exact nature of the maintainability challenge. Be that as it may.
12. It is against the above backdrop that we are called upon to determine
the present lis. Instead of remanding the matter back to the Consumer
220 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Forum we intend to decide the maintainability challenge here itself.
The question that has eluded three judicial forums has now to be
settled once and for all. That question simply is: Whether the service
obtained by the complainant was for a commercial purpose?
13. Section 2 (7) of the Act defines a consumer to mean:
Section 2 (7) “consumer” means any person who—
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been
paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or
under any system of deferred payment and includes
any user of such goods other than the person who
buys such goods for consideration paid or promised
or partly paid or partly promised, or under any system
of deferred payment, when such use is made with
the approval of such person, but does not include a
person who obtains such goods for resale or for any
commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires or avails of any service for a consideration
which has been paid or promised or partly paid and
partly promised, or under any system of deferred
payment and includes any beneficiary of such
service other than the person who hires or avails of
the services for consideration paid or promised, or
partly paid and partly promised, or under any system
of deferred payment, when such services are availed
of with the approval of the first mentioned person,
but does not include a person who avails of such
service for any commercial purpose.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause,—
(a) the expression “commercial purpose” does not
include use by a person of goods bought and used
by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his
livelihood, by means of self-employment;
(b) the expressions “buys any goods” and “hires
or avails any services” includes offline or online
transactions through electronic means or by
teleshopping or direct selling or multi-level marketing;

14. The provision as it stands now (as extracted above) was not how
it appeared when it was grafted in the original Act. The definition of
‘consumer’ has undergone textual amendments in 1993 and in 2002.

its origin until the 2019 Act is captured in the table below:

15. Structurally, there are three parts to the definition of a consumer.
We can deconstruct Section 2(7)(i) as a matter of illustration.3
The first part sets out the jurisdictional prerequisites for a person
to qualify as a consumer – there must be purchase of goods, for
consideration4 . The second part is an ‘exclusion clause’ [‘carve
out’] which has the effect of excluding the person from the
definition of a consumer. The carve out applies if the person has
obtained goods for the purpose of ‘resale’ or for a ‘commercial
purpose’. The third part is an exception to the exclusion clause – it
relates to Explanation (a) to Section 2(7) which limits the scope
of ‘commercial purpose’. According to the said explanation, the
expression, ‘commercial purpose’ does not include persons who
bought goods ‘exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood,
by means of self-employment’. The significance of this structural
break down will be discussed shortly.
16. The carve out existed as part of the original enactment. However,
the Explanation to Section 2(7) was inserted by amendment in 1993.
17. Judicial experience has shown us that the service providers most
often than not take up a plea in their written version that the service
obtained/goods bought was for a commercial purpose. For, if they
succeed in their plea, the complainant is excluded from availing any
benefit under the Act. According to Section 11, the District Forum
has jurisdiction to entertain complaints ‘where the value of the goods
or services and the compensation, if any, claimed does not exceed
rupees twenty lakhs’. The expression ‘complaint’ is defined in Section
2(1)(7)(c) to mean any allegation made in writing by a complainant
relating to certain enumerated subjects. A complainant is defined
2(1)(b) to mean a consumer, among other entities. Therefore, to
file a complaint, one must be a complainant and for one to be a
complainant, he must be a consumer. If a person fails to come
within the definition of a consumer, he cannot be a complainant5
and therefore, such person cannot file a complaint under the Act.
3 The logic can be identically extended to Section 2(7)(ii)
4 The consideration may have been paid or partly paid or agreed to be paid in future.
5 Complainant is defined under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Act. A complainant means – (i) a consumer; or (ii)
any voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act,1956 or under any other law for
the time being in force; or (iii) the Central Government or any State Government, who or which makes a
complaint.
224 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
18. In the facts of the instant case, the OP had raised a plea in its version
that the complainant does not satisfy the definition of consumer
since the service was obtained for a commercial purpose. Sri
Shailesh Madiyal, learned Senior Advocate for the OP has argued
vehemently that the complainant has not pleaded let alone prove
that the services availed by it was for securing the livelihood of
the complainant by means of self-employment. According to Sri
Shailesh Madiyal, the onus to prove that services were availed
for earning livelihood rests on the complainant. In support of his
submission, he has relied on Laxmi Engineering Works – (1995)
3 SCC 583; Leelavathi Kirtilal Medical Trust v. Unique Shanti
Developers – (2020) 2 SCC 265; Cheema Engineering Services
(1997) 1 SCC 131 and; Paramount Digital Lab (2018) 14 SCC 81.
19. Before we deal with the contention of Sri Shailesh Madiyal, it
would be necessary to set out the manner in which consumer
forums must decide technical pleas raised by service providers
to the effect that the services obtained/goods bought was for a
commercial purpose and, therefore, the complaint filed on behalf
of such persons are not maintainable. The crucial step in deciding
such pleas would turn on the manner in which the issues are
framed. Unless the burden of proof is properly cast on the relevant
party, the consumer forum would not be in a position to arrive at
proper decision. Therefore, we proceed to provide some guidance
on how the issues must be framed and the manner in which the
evidence must be appreciated.
20. As we have shown above, the definition of consumer has three
parts. The significance of deconstructing the definition into three
parts was for the purpose of explaining on whom lies the onus
to prove each of the different parts. There can hardly be any
dispute that the onus of proving the first part i.e. that the person
had bought goods/availed services for a consideration, rests on
the complainant himself. The carve out clause, in the second part,
is invoked by the service providers to exclude the complainants
from availing benefits under the Act. The onus of proving that the
person falls within the carve out must necessarily rest on the service
provider and not the complainant. This is in sync with the general
principle embodied in Section 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act
that ‘one who pleads must prove’. Since it is always the service
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 225
Shriram Chits (India) Private Limited Earlier Known as
Shriram Chits (K) Pvt. Ltd v. Raghachand Associates
provider who pleads that the service was obtained for a commercial
purpose, the onus of proving the same would have to be borne by
it. Further, it cannot be forgotten that the Consumer Protection Act
is a consumer-friendly and beneficial legislation intended to address
grievances of consumers.6 Moreover, a negative burden cannot be
placed on the complainant to show that the service available was
not for a commercial purpose.
21. Having held that the onus to prove that the service was obtained for
a commercial purpose is on the service provider, we may clarify the
standard of proof that has to be met in order to discharge the onus.
The standard of proof has to be measured against a ‘preponderance
of probabilities’. The test to determine whether service obtained
qualified as a commercial purpose is no longer res integra in view
of this Court’s decision in Lilavathi v. Kiritlal (supra). Para 19 sets
out the principles on which it must be determined whether the onus
of proving ‘commercial purpose’ has been properly discharged by
the service provider.
22. If and only if, the service provider discharges its onus of showing
that the service was availed, in fact for a commercial purpose, does
the onus shift back to the complainant to bring its case within the
third part, i.e. the Explanation (a) to Section 2(7) – to show that
the service was obtained exclusively for the purpose of earning its
livelihood by means of self-employment.
23. In this background, we must consider the plea of Sri Shailesh Madiyal
that the complainant has not pleaded nor proved that the service
was obtained for earning his livelihood through the means of self-
employment. His argument relates to the third part of the definition
of consumer. The question of inquiring into the third part will only
arise if the service provider succeeds in crossing the second part
by discharging its onus and proving that the service obtained was
for a commercial purpose. Unless the service provider discharges
its onus, the onus does not shift back to the complainant to show
that the service obtained was exclusively for earning its livelihood
through the means of self-employment. In the facts of this case, the
OP has merely pleaded in its version that the service was obtained
6 National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Harsolia Motors and Ors. (2023) 8 SCC 362.
226 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
for a commercial purpose. No evidence has been led to probabilise
its case other than merely restating its claim on affidavit. It is now
well too settled that a plea without proof and proof without plea is
no evidence in the eyes of law.
24. We do not wish to address ourselves to the merits of the issue since
three Forums have concurred in their finding that there was proved
deficiency of service.
25. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals.

Held: In two Judges bench decision in B. Vijaya Bharathi, the

Abhay S. Oka, J.
1. This appeal is at the instance of the original third, second, and
fourth defendants. The first and second respondents are the original
plaintiffs. The third respondent is the mother of the deceased original
first defendant. For convenience, we are referring to the parties
according to their status in the suit.
FACTUAL ASPECT
2. Reference to a few factual aspects will be necessary. The first
defendant executed a registered agreement for sale dated 7th
December 1981 by which he agreed to sell his Bhumidhari land
measuring 2.90 acres of Khasra no. 48 (for short, ‘the suit property’)
at village-Jauniwala, Tehsil-Kashipur, District-Nainital in favour of the
plaintiffs for the consideration of Rs. 20,300/-. There was a recital in
the registered agreement dated 7th December 1981 (for short, ‘the
suit agreement’) that the first defendant had received a sum of Rs.
7,000/- as advance and the balance consideration was payable at
the time of execution of the sale deed. The first defendant agreed
to execute the sale deed within three years from the date of the suit
agreement. According to the plaintiffs’ case, requests were made
orally and by sending notices to the first defendant to execute the
sale deed. It is pleaded in the plaint that the first defendant refused
to accept notices.
3. On 6th September 1983, the first defendant sold 1.60 acres out of
the suit property to the second and third defendants by a registered
sale deed. By another sale deed dated 12th December 1983, the
first defendant sold the remaining part of the suit property to the
second to fourth defendants. We must note that the suit was filed on
17th December 1983, and the averments regarding the subsequent
alienations were incorporated by the amendment made to the plaint
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 401
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
in terms of the order dated 28th July 1984. The case made out in the
plaint is that the subsequent sale deeds are collusive. The prayer
in the suit was for specific performance of the suit agreement with
a direction to the defendants to hand over possession of the suit
property to the plaintiffs and to execute a sale deed in respect of
the suit property in their favour.
4. The defendants, including the legal representative (Smt. Bhagwati
Devi) of the original first defendant, filed separate written statements.
In the written statement filed by the legal representative of the first
defendant, it was contended that the suit agreement was fictitious.
In the written statement filed by the second and third defendants,
it was pleaded that the suit agreement is a forged document which
was never to be acted upon. It is pointed out that the first plaintiff
- Karan Singh, and the first defendant were relatives. The plaintiffs
never paid any money to the first defendant.
5. The first plaintiff was examined as a witness. The second plaintiff,
Murari Singh, did not support the first plaintiff. He deposed in favour
of the defendants. He stated on oath that the suit agreement was
made only to ensure that the first defendant did not alienate the
suit land. He stated that the first defendant was his relative. He
stated that the first plaintiff was related to him and was a well-known
person. The first plaintiff’s name was included as the purchaser in
the suit agreement to deter the first defendant. He stated that he
and the first plaintiff never demanded execution of the sale deed
from the first defendant. The second plaintiff proceeded to state
that he had not filed the suit, and the signature shown to him on
the vakalatnama was of someone else. Subsequently, the second
plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that the first defendant had several
bad habits and, therefore, there was an apprehension that he would
sell the suit property.
FINDINGS OF THE COURTS
6. The Trial Court held that the execution of the suit agreement was
proved. Relying upon Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
(for short, ‘the Evidence Act’), the learned Trial Judge held that
evidence contrary to the contents of the suit agreement could not
be adduced and was not admissible in evidence. The learned Trial
Judge held that in view of the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Civil
Laws (Reforms and Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into force
402 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
on 31st December 1976, an agreement for sale was compulsorily
registrable in the State at the relevant time. Therefore, the learned
Trial Judge held that in view of the explanation to Section 3 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (for short, ‘the TP Act’), the second to
fourth defendants shall be deemed to have a notice of the execution
of the suit agreement. The learned Judge held that it was a duty
of the second to fourth defendants to take a search in the office of
the Sub-Registrar to ascertain whether there was any prior transfer.
Therefore, the learned Trial judge held that the second to fourth
defendants could not be held to be bona fide purchasers for value
received. The finding on the issue of readiness and willingness
was also recorded in favour of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the Trial
Court passed a decree for the specific performance, directing all
the defendants to execute the sale deed and deliver possession
of the suit property to the plaintiffs. In an appeal preferred by the
second to fourth defendants, the Additional District Judge, Nainital,
confirmed all the findings of the Trial Court. The Additional District
Judge dismissed the appeal. A second appeal was preferred by the
second to fourth respondents. The second appeal has been dismissed
by the impugned judgment.
ORDERS OF THIS COURT
7. On 26th October 2010, this Court issued notice. The order of this
Court reads thus:
“Mr. K.B. Sinha, senior advocate appearing for the
petitioners submits that after coming into force of the
Uttaranchal (The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and
Land Reforms Act, 1950) (Adaptation and Modification
Order, 2001) (Amendment) Act, 2003, the sale of the
suit land in terms of the decrees of the Court would be
violative of the provisions of the Act because the plaintiff
is not an agriculturist.
Issue notice.
In the meanwhile, there shall be stay of operation of the
impugned decree.”
On 12th August 2013, leave was granted. This Court granted a stay
to the operation of the impugned decrees on 26th October 2010.

SUBMISSIONS
8. The learned senior counsel appearing for the second to fourth
defendants submitted that the three Courts refused to consider
the submission that the suit agreement was sham and bogus. By
pointing out Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act, he urged that
the provisions did not prevent the defendants from leading evidence
to show that the suit agreement was bogus or sham. He relied on
the Privy Council’s decision in the case of Tyagaraja Mudaliyar
and Anr. v. Vedathanni1. He submitted that Sections 91 and 92
of the Evidence Act do not exclude evidence on the question of
whether the parties had agreed to contract on the terms set forth
in the document. He also relied upon a decision of this Court in the
case of Krishnabai Bhritar Ganpatrao Deshmukh v. Appasaheb
Tuljaramarao Nimbalkar & Ors.2. He submitted that it was brought
on record in the depositions of the second plaintiff who was the uncle
of the first defendant, and Bhagwati Devi, the mother of the first
defendant, that the first defendant had many vices. Bhagwati Devi
was apprehensive that the first defendant would sell the property
to fund his bad lifestyle. The second plaintiff, Murari Singh, was
her brother; therefore, she approached Murari Singh to prevent the
first defendant from selling the suit property. The second plaintiff,
Murari Singh, brought his friend, the first plaintiff. Thereafter, the suit
agreement was executed to deter the first defendant from selling the
property. He submitted the specific contention that the suit agreement
was a sham document which was not to be acted upon has been
brushed aside by the three Courts.
9. He submitted that the first plaintiff filed the suit within a few days
after the first defendant executed a sale deed on 12th December
1983 in favour of the second to fourth defendants. The learned senior
counsel further submitted that the second to fourth defendants are
bona-fide purchasers as the suit agreement is sham and bogus.
He submitted that the defence that the plaintiffs were not ready and
willing to perform their part of the suit agreement is also available
to the defendants claiming to be subsequent purchasers through
the vendor. The learned senior counsel relied upon a decision of
1 ILR (1936) 59 Mad 446 : 1935 SCC OnLine PC 68
2 [1980] 1 SCR 161 : (1979) 4 SCC 60
404 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
this Court in the case of B. Vijaya Bharathi v. P. Savitri & Ors.3,
and submitted that the plaintiffs are disentitled to relief of specific
performance as they have not prayed in the plaint for setting aside
or cancelling the subsequent sale deeds. Learned senior counsel
also relied upon Section 154-B of the Uttaranchal (The Uttar Pradesh
Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950) (Adaption and
Modification order, 2001) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2003 (for short,
‘the Zamindari Abolition Act”). He submitted that as the 1st plaintiff
is not an agriculturist within the meaning of Section 3(a) thereof, in
view of Section 154-B, a sale deed cannot be executed in terms of
the suit agreement. He also pointed out that the legal representatives
of the first respondent (first Plaintiff) have not chosen to contest the
appeal despite service of notice. Therefore, they are not interested
in contesting the appeal.
QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION
10. After having considered the submissions of the learned counsel
appearing for the appellants, we find that the following questions
arise:
a) Can the contention that the suit agreement was sham and
bogus and not intended to be acted upon be allowed to be
raised notwithstanding Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act?
b) Was the suit agreement sham and bogus and not intended to
be acted upon?
c) Were the second to fourth defendants bona fide purchasers
for value without notice of the suit agreement?
d) Whether, in view of the decision of this Court in the case of
B. Vijaya Bharathi3, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree
of specific performance in the absence of any prayer for
cancellation of the two subsequent sale deeds?
e) Do the provisions of the Zamindari Abolition Act create a bar on
the execution of the sale deed in terms of the suit agreement?
f) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree of specific
performance?
3 [2017] 7 SCR 746 : (2018) 11 SCC 761
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 405
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
FIRST TWO QUESTIONS – (a) AND (b)
11. Now, we come to the first two questions. Right from the decision
of the Privy Council in the case of Tyagaraja Mudaliyar1 the law is
well settled. Section 91 of the Evidence Act excludes oral evidence
of the terms of the written document by requiring those terms to be
proved by the document itself. Section 92 excludes oral evidence
for contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting to such terms.
These two sections do not prevent parties from adducing evidence
on the issue of whether the parties to the documents had agreed
to contract on the terms set forth in the document.
12. Coming to the facts of the case, firstly, we must refer to the pleadings
of the legal representative of the first defendant. In paragraph 11 of
her written statement, she raised the following contention:
“…………………………………………………
11. That the real facts are that plaintiff Murari Singh is
the brother of answering respondent and Karan Singh
is his friend. So, under fear and making the pressure on
Preetam Singh, a fictitious agreement was prepared by
plaintiff Murari Singh without any consideration in order
to deter late Preetam Singh, so that the should not sale
the land. Neither this agreement was acted upon nor was
disclosed any time. The said amount for consideration,
written in the agreement, is shown at very low price from
the market price.
…………………………………………………”
Thus, the legal representative of the first defendant did not plead that
the first defendant was addicted to several vices and that to prevent
him from selling the suit property for supporting his bad lifestyle, the
suit agreement was executed. It is merely stated that the second
plaintiff prepared a fictitious agreement without any consideration
to deter the first defendant from selling the land. It is not pleaded
that as the first plaintiff was an influential person, he was brought
into the picture to deter the first defendant. The second and third
defendants filed a written statement. The contention raised by them
in the written statement is entirely different. In paragraph 12 of the
written statement, they pleaded thus:
“…………………………………………………
406 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
12. That the alleged agreement to sale dated 17.12.1981
is a forged document and was never acted upon. The
plaintiff no. 1 and Sh. Pritam Singh are relative to each
other. The plaintiffs are the resident of some other districts.
They never paid any money. They got prepared a forged
documents colluding with some persons of their party.
The agreement to sale is illegal and the plaintiffs are not
entitled of any relief on the basis of this forged document.
…………………………………………………”
The legal representative of the first defendant did not dispute that the
first defendant signed the agreement. However, the other defendants
raised a contention that the suit agreement was a forged document.
The second to fourth defendants did not plead anything about the
object of getting the agreement for sale executed from the first
defendant. The case that the first defendant was addicted to vices
and that with a view to deter him from selling the suit property, the
agreement for sale was executed, was pleaded for the first time by
the mother of the first defendant in her evidence. Even the allegation
that the first plaintiff was joined as a purchaser to put pressure on the
deceased - the first defendant was made by her for the first time in
her evidence. Thus, the contention that the deceased-first defendant
was addicted to vices was never raised in the written statements and
the same has come by way of an afterthought in the evidence of the
mother of the first defendant. Moreover, the stand of the second to
fourth defendants in their written statement is that the suit agreement
was forged and was prepared by the plaintiffs and some persons
of their party. Therefore, in the facts of the case, it is very difficult
to accept the contention that the suit agreement was got executed
from the first defendant with the object to deter him from selling the
suit property to meet the demands of his bad lifestyle. Hence, the
suit agreement cannot be held as bogus or sham.
ON QUESTION – (c)
13. The three Courts concurrently found that under the Uttar Pradesh
Civil Laws (Reforms and Amendment) Act 1976, clause (v) of Section
17(2) of the Registration Act 1908 was amended, which made an
agreement for the sale of an immovable property, a compulsorily
registerable document in the State. On this aspect, no arguments have
been canvassed by the appellants. Therefore, in view of explanation
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 407
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
1 to Section 3 of the TP Act, the second to fourth defendants shall be
deemed to have knowledge of the suit agreement, which was duly
registered. It cannot be said that the second to fourth defendants
had no knowledge of the suit agreement in view of the constructive
notice. It is not their case that they took a search in the office of the
Sub-Registrar before getting the sale deeds in their favour. Hence,
it cannot be said that they paid money in good faith to the first
Defendant. Therefore, the second to fourth defendants can never
be held to be bona-fide purchasers who have paid consideration in
good faith without the notice of the suit agreement.
ON QUESTION (d)
14. Now, we deal with another argument that the plaintiffs ought to have
prayed in the suit to cancel the subsequent sale deeds executed by
the first defendant. On this aspect, the law has been laid down by
a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court in the case of Lala
Durga Prasad & Ors. v. Lala Deep Chand & Ors.4,. Paragraphs
40 to 42 of the said decision read thus:
“40. First, we reach the position that the title to the property
has validly passed from the vendor and resides in the
subsequent transferee. The sale to him is not void but
only voidable at the option of the earlier “contractor”. As
the title no longer rests in the vendor it would be illogical
from a conveyancing point of view to compel him to convey
to the plaintiff unless steps are taken to revest the title
in him either by cancellation of the subsequent sale or
by reconveyance from the subsequent purchaser to him.
We do not know of any case in which a reconveyance to
the vendor was ordered but Sulaiman, C.J. adopted the
other course in Kali Charan Singh v. Janak Deo Singh
[Kali Charan Singh v. Janak Deo Singh, AIR 1932 All 694 :
1932 SCC OnLine All 154] . He directed cancellation of
the subsequent sale and conveyance to the plaintiff by the
vendor in accordance with the contract of sale of which
the plaintiff sought specific performance. But though this
sounds logical the objection to it is that it might bring
in its train complications between the vendor and the
4 [1954] 1 SCR 360 : (1953) 2 SCC 509
408 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
subsequent purchaser. There may be covenants in the
deed between them which it would be inequitable to disturb
by cancellation of their deed. Accordingly, we do not think
that is a desirable solution.
41. We are not enamoured of the next alternative either,
namely, conveyance by the subsequent purchaser alone
to the plaintiff. It is true that would have the effect of
vesting the title to the property in the plaintiff but it might
be inequitable to compel the subsequent transferee to
enter into terms and covenants in the vendor’s agreement
with the plaintiff to which he would never have agreed
had he been a free agent; and if the original contract is
varied by altering or omitting such terms the court will be
remaking the contract, a thing it has no power to do; and
in any case it will no longer be specifically enforcing the
original contract but another and different one.
42. In our opinion, the proper form of decree is to
direct specific performance of the contract between
the vendor and the plaintiff and direct the subsequent
transferee to join in the conveyance so as to pass on
the title which resides in him to the plaintiff. He does
not join in any special covenants made between the
plaintiff and his vendor; all he does is to pass on his
title to the plaintiff. This was the course followed by
the Calcutta High Court in Kafiladdin v. Samiraddin
[Kafiladdin v. Samiraddin, AIR 1931 Cal 67 : 1930
SCC OnLine Cal 46] and appears to be the English
practice. See Fry on Specific Performance, 6th Edn.,
p.90, Para207; also Potter v. Sanders [Potter v. Sanders,
(1846) 6 Hare 1 : 67 ER 1057] . We direct accordingly.”
(emphasis added)
15. Reliance is placed by the appellants on the decision of this Court in
the case of B. Vijaya Bharathi3. In paragraph 17 of the said decision,
this Court held thus:
“17. It must also be noted that though aware of two
conveyances of the same property, the plaintiff did
not ask for their cancellation. This again, would stand
in the way of a decree of specific performance for
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 409
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
unless the sale made by Defendant 1 to Defendant
2, and thereafter by Defendant 2 to Defendant 3 are
set aside, no decree for specific performance could
possibly follow. While Mr Rao may be right in stating that
mere delay without more would not disentitle his client to
the relief of specific performance, for the reasons stated
above, we find that this is not such a case. The High Court
was clearly right in finding that the bar of Section 16(c)
was squarely attracted on the facts of the present case,
and that therefore, the fact that Defendants 2 and 3 may
not be bona fide purchasers would not come in the way of
stating that such suit must be dismissed at the threshold
because of lack of readiness and willingness, which is
a basic condition for the grant of specific performance.”
(emphasis added)
A bench of two Hon’ble Judges has rendered this decision.
Unfortunately, the attention of the Bench was not invited to binding
precedent in the form of a decision of a larger bench in the case of
Lala Durga Prasad & Ors.4. Hence, the decision in the case of B.
Vijaya Bharathi3 is not a binding precedent. Therefore, there was
no requirement to make a prayer in the plaint for cancellation or
setting aside the subsequent sale deeds.
16. Clause (a) to (c) of Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act read thus:
“19. Relief against parties and persons claiming under
them by subsequent title.— Except as otherwise provided
by this Chapter, specific performance of a contract may
be enforced against—
(a) either party thereto;
(b) any other person claiming under him by a
title arising subsequently to the contract, except
a transferee for value who has paid his money
in good faith and without notice of the original
contract;
(c) any person claiming under a title which, though
prior to the contract and known to the plaintiff, might
have been displaced by the defendant;
410 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(d)…………………………………………………
(e)…………………………………………………”
(emphasis added)
In view of clause (b) of Section 19, the defendants who are claiming
under the sale deeds executed after the execution of the suit
agreement can be subjected to a decree of specific performance
as the suit agreement can be enforced specifically against such
defendants unless they are bona-fide purchasers without the notice
of the original contract. When, in a given case, the defendants, who
are subsequent purchasers, fail to prove that they entered into the
sale deed in good faith and without notice of the suit agreement,
in view of Section 19(b), a decree for specific performance can be
passed against such defendants. Therefore, in such a case where
Section 19(b) is applicable, under the decree of specific performance,
the subsequent purchasers can be directed to execute the sale deed
along with the original vendor. There is no necessity to pray for the
cancellation of the subsequent sale deeds.
ON QUESTION – (e)
17. We have perused Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act.
Sub-section (1) prohibits the sale or transfer of agricultural lands
to a person who is not an agriculturalist. Clause (h) of sub-section
(2) of Section 154-B permits the sale of agricultural land to a non-
agriculturalist with the permission of the State Government for the
purposes specified in clause (i) to (v) of clause (h). What is prohibited
is the sale of agricultural land to a non-agriculturalist. In view of
Section 54 of the TP Act, an agreement for sale does not transfer
the property subject matter of the agreement to the purchaser. It
does not create any interest in the property subject matter of the
agreement. Therefore, the embargo created by sub-section (1) of
Section 154-B will apply only to the execution of the sale deed and
not to the execution of the agreement for sale.
18. Now the question is whether the vendor and the persons claiming
through him can be directed to apply for permission in accordance
with clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B to sell and whether
a decree for execution of the sale deed can be made contingent
upon the grant of permission to sell. The law on this aspect is no
longer res integra. In the case of Rojasara Ramjibhai Dahyabhai
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 411
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
v. Jani Narottamdas Lallubhai and another5, in paragraphs 12 to
14, this Court held thus:
“12. Although Rana Mohabat Singh having failed to fulfil
the terms of his contract with the appellant and execute a
sale deed in his favour might have rendered the contract
between them incapable of performance, but with the
extinction of the title of Rana Mohabat Singh and the
conferral of the rights of an occupant on the appellant,
the property became transferable subject, of course, to
the express covenant on the part of the appellant to do all
things necessary to give effect to the agreement. Here, the
suit banakhat (Ex. 25) embodies an express covenant to
that effect. There is always in such contracts an implied
covenant on the part of the vendor to do all things
necessary to give effect to the agreement, including
the obtaining of the permission for the transfer of the
property. The principles on which a term of this nature
may be implied in contracts are well-settled. It is enough
to refer to Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 8, 3rd Edn.,
p. 121 where the principles are summarised as follows:
“In construing a contract, a term or condition not expressly
stated may, under certain circumstances be implied by
the court, if it is clear from the nature of the transaction
or from something actually found in the document that
the contracting parties must have intended such a term
or condition to be a part of the agreement between them.
Such an implication must in all cases be founded on
the presumed intention of the parties and upon reason,
and will only be made when it is necessary in order to
give the transaction that efficacy that both parties must
have intended it to have, and to prevent such a failure
of consideration as could not have been within the
contemplation of the parties.”
Chitty on Contracts Vol. 1, 23rd Edn., paras 694-95 points
out that a term would be implied if it is necessary in the
business sense, to give efficacy to the contract.
5 [1986] 2 SCR 447 : (1986) 3 SCC 300
412 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
13. In this context, reference may be made to the decision
of the Privy Council in Motilal v. Nanhelal [AIR 1930 PC
287 : (1930) 57 IA 333] . There, the facts were these. In that
case, the plaintiff Mst Jankibai entered into an agreement
to purchase from Rajbahadur Seth Jiwandas of Jabalpur
four annas proprietary share of Mauja Raisalpur together
with the sir and khudkast lands appurtenant thereto, with
cultivating rights in the sir lands. The property was subject
to the provisions of the Central Provinces Tenancy Act,
1920. She filed a suit for specific performance of the said
contract. The Privy Council held that the contract was for a
transfer of the sir lands without reservation of the right of
occupancy, and that the sanction of the Revenue Officer
to the transfer was necessary under Section 50(1) of the
Act, which was in these terms:
“50. (1) If a proprietor desires to transfer the proprietary
rights in any portion of his sir land without reservation of
the right of occupancy specified in Section 49, he may
apply to a revenue-officer and, if such revenue-officer
is satisfied that the transferor is not wholly or mainly an
agriculturist, or that the property is self-acquired or has
been acquired within the twenty years last preceding, he
shall sanction the transfer.”
14. It was contended before the Privy Council that a decree
for specific performance of the agreement of sale could not
be made, because such performance would necessitate an
application by or on behalf of the vendor to the Revenue
Officer for sanction to transfer the cultivating rights in the
sir land, and that the court had no jurisdiction to require
the vendor to make such an application. In repelling the
contention, the Privy Council observed that in view of their
construction of the agreement, namely, that the vendor
agreed to transfer the cultivating rights in the sir land:
“There was, in Their Lordships’ opinion, an implied
covenant on the part of the vendor to do all things necessary
to effect such transfer, which would include an application
to the Revenue Officer to sanction the transfer.”
It was further observed that it was not necessary for their
Lordships to decide whether in that case the application for
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 413
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
sanction to transfer must succeed, but that it was material
to mention that no facts were brought to their Lordships’
notice which would go to show that there was any reason
why such sanction should not be granted. After making the
said observations, the Privy Council held that in those
circumstances the court had jurisdiction to enforce the
contract under the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and Order
21, Rule 35 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by a
decree ordering the vendor to apply for sanction and
to execute a conveyance on receipt of such sanction.
The decision of the Privy Council in Motilal v. Nanhelal
[AIR 1930 PC 287 : (1930) 57 IA 333] therefore is an
authority for the proposition that if the vendor agrees
to sell the property which can be transferred only with
the sanction of some government authority, the court
has jurisdiction to order the vendor to apply to the
authority within a specified period, and if the sanction
is forthcoming to convey to the purchaser within a
certain time. See also Chandnee Widya Vati Madden v.
C.L. Katial [AIR 1964 SC 978 : (1964) 2 SCR 495] and
R.C. Chandiok v. Chuni Lal Sabharwal [(1970) 3 SCC
140 : AIR 1971 SC 1238 : (1971) 2 SCR 573] where this
Court following the Privy Council decision in Motilal
v. Nanhelal case [AIR 1930 PC 287 : (1930) 57 IA 333]
reiterated the same principle.”
(emphasis added)
Hence, a decree enjoining the defendants to obtain permission to sell
the suit property can be passed as it is their implied obligation to do
so. A decree for the specific performance can be passed contingent
upon the grant of the permission.
ON QUESTION – (f)
19. Now, the question is whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree
for specific performance. In his deposition, the first plaintiff has proved
the service of notice of demand to the first defendant. The suit is filed
within limitation, and the defendants did not raise a plea of delay and
laches. There are concurrent findings of the three Courts on the issue
of the readiness and willingness shown by the first plaintiff. There
is no reason to disturb the said findings. Now, the question is, what
414 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is the effect of the failure of the second plaintiff to support the first
plaintiff and his conduct of supporting the defendants? In the facts
of the case, the answer lies in the submissions made by the second
to fourth defendants before the High Court. In paragraph 9 of the
judgment, the High Court has recorded the following submissions
made by the counsel for the second to fourth defendants:
“9. The learned senior counsel for the appellants
submitted that the plaintiff no.2 Murari Singh did not
file the suit nor had signed the vakalatnama and that
the said plaintiff had admitted this fact in his deposition,
consequently, the suit was not maintainable. It was further
submitted that the percentage of share between the
plaintiffs were not defined in the agreement to sell
and, consequently, under Section 45 of the Transfer
of Property Act, the plaintiffs would be deemed to
have equal shares, namely, 50 percent. The learned
senior counsel for the appellants contended that
since Murari Singh did not institute the suit, the
decree for specific performance for the whole land,
which was undivided could not have been decreed
by the trial court and, consequently, to that extent,
the decree passed by the trial court was erroneous.
………………………………………………………”
(emphasis added)
20. In our view, as the second plaintiff was not interested in getting the
specific performance, the decree ought to have been restricted to
the undivided one-half share in the suit property in favour of only
the first plaintiff.
21. Accordingly, we partly allow the appeal by passing the following order:
(a) We modify the impugned decree by directing the legal
representative of the first defendant and second to fourth
defendants to execute a sale deed in favour of the first plaintiff
(Karan Singh) only to the extent of one half undivided share
in the suit property;
(b) The defendants shall join the first plaintiff in applying to the State
Government/Competent Authority for the grant of permission
under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 415
Maharaj Singh & Ors. v. Karan Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Ors.
Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one half-undivided share in
the suit land to the first plaintiff within two months from today.
It shall be the obligation of the defendants to apply for the
permission and to do all such things which are necessary to
get the permission;
(c) If the defendants or any of them do not sign and file the
application with relevant documents within the period mentioned
above of two months, the executing Court shall appoint a Court
Commissioner to sign and file the application on their behalf and
to do all such things which are necessary to get the permission;
(d) If the application for grant of permission is rejected, it will be
open to the first plaintiff to challenge the order of rejection in
accordance with law. If the application for grant of permission
is finally rejected, there shall be a decree for refund of the
sum of Rs. 7,000/- against the legal representative of the first
defendant together with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent
per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the realisation.
However, her liability shall be restricted to the extent of the
estate of the first defendant inherited by her;
(e) If the State Government grants permission, the sale deed shall
be executed in terms of clause (a) by all the defendants within
three months from the date of grant of the permission;
(f) The suit stands dismissed as far as the second plaintiff is
concerned;
(g) The impugned decree stands modified accordingly;
(h) Even if a sale deed is executed in favour of the first plaintiff in
respect of the one-half undivided share in the suit property, he
will not be entitled to seek possession in the execution of this
decree as he will be at liberty to file a suit for general partition;
(i) Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed with no orders as to cost.
Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed.

(Civil Appeal No. 8829 of 2010)
08 July 2024
[Abhay S. Oka and Pankaj Mithal,* JJ.]","Whether the present suit (claiming title and possession over
the suit land) as filed by the plaintiff-appellant was barred under
Section 11 CPC on principle of res judicata inasmuch as there
was no adjudication of the rights of the co-defendants (including
appellant) in the previous suit with regard to the suit land and the
issue therein was not directly or indirectly and substantially the
same as in the present suit.
","Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – s.11 – Res judicata – Rights
of co-defendants – The title suit no.9/89 of the plaintiff-
appellant was decreed by the Court of the first instance – In
appeal, the First appellate Court reversed the decree on the
ground that the suit was hit by the principle of res judicata
in view of an earlier suit no.8/64 instituted by M wherein the
plaintiff-appellant was defendant no.2 – The second appeal was
dismissed on the ground that it did not state any substantial
question of law – Propriety:
Held: The lis in the previous suit i.e. Suit No.8/64 was regarding
ownership and entitlement of M over the entire 5.38 acres of land
of village Ramgarh qua the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh; the
plaintiff-appellant and other defendants in the said suit; whereas
the controversy in the present suit is quite distinct with regard to
only 0.30 acres of the suit land vis-à-vis the plaintiff-appellant and
the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh – The suit, as filed by M claiming
right, title and interest over 5.38 acres of land of village Ramgarh
was dismissed simpliciter without adjudication of any rights of the
plaintiff-appellant over the suit land vis-à-vis the Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh – It is a settled law that the principle of res judicata is
applicable not only between the plaintiff and the defendants but

also between the co-defendants – In applying the principle of res
judicata between the co-defendants, primarily three conditions
are necessary to be fulfilled, namely, (i) there must be a conflict
of interest between the co-defendants; (ii) there is necessity to
decide the said conflict in order to give relief to plaintiff; and (iii)
there is final decision adjudicating the said conflict – In the instant
case, there was no conflict of interest between the co-defendants
in the earlier Suit No. 8 of 64 inasmuch as the plaintiff-appellant
was independently claiming rights over 0.30 acres of suit land
whereas the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh was claiming rights
over 2.55 acres of the land which formed part of the Estate of R
without asserting that the land settled in its favour is the same as
claimed by plaintiff-appellant or that there was any encroachment
upon the land settled in its favour – M was claiming the entire
Estate of 5.38 acres of land and her claim was defeated as she
was unable to prove the grant of the said land in her favour with
no specific finding by the court regarding the claims set up by the
codefendants, the inter se dispute of the co-defendants as raised
in the present suit never came to be adjudicated – In view of the
facts and circumstances, the principle of res judicata is not attracted
– As far as claim of the plaintiff-appellant is concerned, the plaintiff-
appellant by sufficient evidence has proved the settlement of the
suit land by the R in his favour – It stands proved by the Amin
report (Exh.8) dated 15.04.1942 20 and the Hukumnama (Exh.9)
dated 07.04.1943 as well as the Rent receipt (Exh.6, 6/A and 7) –
The order of the Additional Collector, Hazaribagh dated 07.01.1963
(Exh.16) directing realization of rent from the plaintiff-appellant
also confirms the above settlement and its subsequent approval
by the State on enhancement of rent – All these documents have
not been confronted by the other side – The fact that the name
of the plaintiff-appellant was also mutated in the revenue records
proves it beyond doubt, in the absence of any contrary evidence
that he is in possession of the suit land. [Paras 20, 21, 23, 25, 33]

1. Shri Manoj Goel, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Shri
Manoj Swarup, learned senior counsel for the respondents were heard.
2. The Title Suit No.9/89 of the plaintiff-appellant (Har Narayan Tewari)
was decreed on 16.03.2000 by the court of first instance. In an appeal
by the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh, the said decree was reversed by
the First Appellate Court vide judgment and order dated 28.06.2006;
basically on the ground that the suit was hit by principle of res judicata
in view of the decision in the earlier Title Suit No.8/64 instituted by
Maharani Lalita Rajya Lakshmi1 (wife of Raja Bahadur Kamakshya
Narayan Singh2) wherein the plaintiff-appellant was defendant No.32
and the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh was the main contesting
defendant. The Second Appeal preferred by the plaintiff-appellant to
the High Court was dismissed on 01.04.2009 simply stating that it
does not raise any substantial question of law.
1 Hereinafter referred to as “Maharani”
2 Hereinafter referred to as “Raja”
32 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
3. Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court dated
01.04.2009 dismissing the appeal; the plaintiff-appellant has preferred
this appeal and has also assailed the judgment and order dated
28.06.2006 of the First Appellate Court alleging that his suit was
not barred by res judicata and that he has validly acquired title and
possession over the disputed land.
4. The plaintiff-appellant had filed the above referred Title Suit No.9/89
for declaration of his title over the properties mentioned in Schedule
‘A’ of the plaint with structures and buildings standing thereon and
for confirmation of his possession over the same. In the alternative,
a prayer was made that in case the plaintiff-appellant was not
found in possession of the said property, the Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh, or any person claiming through it, be evicted and he be
put in possession with the further direction that they be restrained
by a decree of permanent injunction from dispossessing the plaintiff-
appellant from the said property in future.
5. According to Schedule ‘A’ of the plaint, the dispute is about two
pieces of land: First, land measuring 0.12 acres out of 2.04 acres
of Plot No.432; and secondly land measuring 0.18 acres out of
0.66 acres of Plot No.438 both situate in village Ramgarh, within
the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh with boundaries as described in
the Schedule. In short, the dispute in the suit is only regarding 0.12
acres of Plot No.432 and 0.18 acres of Plot No.438 i.e. total of 0.30
acres of the above two plots and the structures existing thereon.
6. The plaintiff-appellant is claiming title and possession over the suit
land alleging that the Raja, the proprietor of the village, had settled
the aforesaid land measuring 0.30 acres of the land comprising of
Plot Nos.432 and 438 in his favour in the year 1942.
7. The case of the plaintiff-appellant was that village Ramgarh was
the part of the Estate of Raja. It was under the management of the
Court of Wards and was released in Raja’s favour in the year 1937.
During the period of its management by the Court of Wards, its
manager acquired 5.38 acres of additional land comprised in various
plots including Plot Nos.432 and 438 in proceedings bearing Case
No.1/1926-27 and came in possession thereof.
8. The Raja in the year 1942 made a permanent raiyati settlement of
the suit land in favour of the plaintiff-appellant and also delivered its
possession to him on payment of rent and salami of Rs.2,000/-. After
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 33
Har Narayan Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh Cantonment & Ors.
vesting of the Estate of Ramgarh in the State of Bihar, the name
of the plaintiff-appellant was mutated upon enhancement of rent @
Rs.2/- per decimal by an order dated 04.01.1963 of the Additional
Collector, Ramgarh passed in Case No.115/62-63 (Exh.13). The
plaintiff-appellant had constructed certain structures on the said
land which have been let out to various persons, all of whom are
defendants in the suit.
9. Upon the establishment of the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh, the
ex-proprietor Raja handed over 2.55 acres of land (excluding the
suit land) with the dispensary building etc. to the Cantonment
Board temporarily. The Cantonment Board, as such, never came
in possession of more than 2.55 acres of land that too which was
other than the land settled and occupied by the plaintiff-appellant.
10. In 1964, Maharani, the wife of the Raja, instituted a Title Suit No.8/64,
inter alia, for declaration of her title over 5.38 acres of the land of
the village including 0.30 acres land of the plaintiff-appellant. The
aforesaid claim was made on the basis of the maintenance grant
allegedly made by the Raja in her favour.
11. The aforesaid suit was contested by the plaintiff-appellant by filing a
written statement and claiming 0.30 acres land on the basis of raiyati
rights granted by the Raja in the year 1942. The Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh, claimed distinct rights in different portions of the land to
the extent of 2.55 acres only, comprising of dispensary building and
quarters of the doctors on the basis of possessory rights granted
by the Raja.
12. In the aforesaid case, Maharani entered into a compromise with
several defendants including the plaintiff-appellant (who was
defendant No.32 in the said suit). According to the said compromise,
Maharani admitted the possession of the plaintiff-appellant over the
suit land to the extent of 0.30 acres in Plot Nos.432 and 438 and it
was agreed that she will have no concern with the same and that
the plaintiff-appellant will remain in exclusive possession of it. The
Cantonment Board, Ramgarh did not object to it or challenge the
compromise.
13. In the said suit, as many as nine issues were framed including the
maintainability of the suit and about the right, title and possession
of Maharani. The suit of the Maharani was dismissed vide judgment
and order dated 31.03.1984, primarily on the ground that it was not
34 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
maintainable as the State of Bihar being a necessary party, was not
made a party and that Maharani had not entered into the witness
box to prove her case. She as such, was not found to be the owner
in possession of the land claimed by her. The court in dismissing
the suit clearly mentioned that the parties who have entered into the
compromise with Maharani will not have any right on the basis of the
compromise deed as she herself has failed to prove her independent
rights over the land claimed by her.
14. The second appeal filed by the plaintiff-appellant was dismissed by
the High Court as it failed to raise any substantial question of law,
which is mandatory for entertaining an appeal under Section 100 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the first point which arises
for consideration herein is - whether in the facts and circumstances
of the case, any substantial question of law was involved in the
second appeal.
15. The submission is that the plaintiff-appellant was non-suited by the
First Appellate Court, on the ground that his suit was barred by
res judicata. One of the essential conditions for the applicability of
principle of res judicata as enshrined under Section 11 of the CPC
is that the issue in the earlier suit and the subsequent suit ought to
be directly and substantially the same. In the earlier Suit No. 8/64
instituted by Maharani, her claim was that she is the lawful owner
of the entire 5.38 acre of land of Village Ramgarh, on the basis of
the maintenance grant made in her favour by the Raja. In the said
suit, the plaintiff-appellant was defendant no. 32 and the Cantonment
Board, Ramgarh was defendant No. 1. The claim set up by Maharani
was not accepted and ex-facie there was no adjudication regarding
the rights of the co-defendants over the suit land viz 0.30 acres of
land of plot Nos. 432 and 438 as claimed by the plaintiff-appellant in
the present suit. The limited issue therein was whether the Maharani
had acquired any right in the above entire property on the basis of
maintenance in grant alleged to be executed by the Raja in her favour.
There was no issue as to whether the suit land as claimed by the
plaintiff-appellant belonged to him or was settled or not settled in his
favour as claimed. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
a clear substantial question of law as to whether the present suit
as filed by the plaintiff-appellant was barred under Section 11 CPC
on principle of res judicata inasmuch as there was no adjudication
of the rights of the co-defendants in the previous suit with regard to
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 35
Har Narayan Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh Cantonment & Ors.
the suit land and the issue therein was not directly or indirectly and
substantially the same as in the present suit.
16. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the High Court
manifestly erred in dismissing the second appeal in limine on the
ground that there was no substantial question of law involved therein.
17. As stated earlier, the substantial question of law arising in the second
appeal was - Whether the suit as setup by the plaintiff-appellant
was barred by principle of res judicata in view of the decision in the
earlier Suit No. 8 of 64 wherein rights of the co-defendants in respect
of the suit land were never adjudicated and non-acceptance of the
claim of Maharani was not sufficient so as to decide the rights of
the co-defendants.
18. There are no factual disputes which may require consideration of
any evidence so as to answer the above substantial question of law.
Therefore, we consider it appropriate to decide the above substantial
question of law ourselves instead of leaving it for the High Court to
adjudicate it.
19. It is an admitted position that the suit land i.e., portions of plot Nos.
432 and 438 were part of the Estate of Raja who had acquired about
5.38 acres of additional land of village Ramgarh. Maharani had
claimed title over the entire aforesaid land of village Ramgarh but
her claim was not accepted by the court in her Title Suit No.8/64. It
means that she was unable to establish her right, title and interest
over the said land on the basis of the alleged maintenance grant
made in her favour by the Raja, but it does not mean that the suit
land was not settled by the Raja in favour of the plaintiff-appellant
or that the suit land had come to be settled with Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh in any manner.
20. The lis in the previous suit i.e. Suit No.8/64 was regarding ownership
and entitlement of Maharani over the entire 5.38 acres of land
of village Ramgarh qua the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh; the
plaintiff-appellant and other defendants in the said suit; whereas the
controversy in the present suit is quite distinct with regard to only
0.30 acres of the suit land vis-à-vis the plaintiff-appellant and the
Cantonment Board, Ramgarh.
21. The judgment and order of the previous suit which is final and
conclusive, in no specific terms adjudicates upon the right, title
36 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and interest of either of the plaintiff-appellant or of the Cantonment
Board, Ramgarh with regard to the suit land. In the said suit, there
was no issue with regard to the right, title and possession of either
the plaintiff-appellant or of the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh and no
finding in this connection was returned by the court in dismissing
the said suit. In simple words, the suit, as filed by Maharani claiming
right, title and interest over 5.38 acres of land of village Ramgarh
was dismissed simpliciter without adjudication of any rights of the
plaintiff-appellant over the suit land vis-à-vis the Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh.
22. It may also be pertinent to point out that the Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh throughout had claimed rights over 2.55 acres of land
of village Ramgarh and not in respect of the entire 5.38 acres of
land which was additionally acquired by the Raja. It is also not the
case of the Cantonment Board, Ramgarh that the land which was
temporarily settled in its favour by the Raja has been occupied by
the plaintiff-appellant or that the plaintiff-appellant is claiming rights
over the land which was settled in its favour. In other words, the
land belonged to the Raja, part of which was settled in favour of the
plaintiff-appellant to the extent of 0.30 acres of plot Nos. 432 and 438,
whereas, another piece of land measuring 2.55 acres with certain
structures but certainly excluding the suit land was settled in favour
of Cantonment Board, Ramgarh. The right of the plaintiff-appellant
to claim the suit land or the right of the Cantonment Board over the
2.55 acres of land settled in its favour never came to be adjudicated
in previous Title Suit No. 8 of 64.
23. The general policy behind the principle of res judicata as enshrined
under Section 11 CPC is to avoid parties to litigate on the same
issue which has already been adjudicated upon and settled. This
is in consonance with the public policy so as to bring to an end the
conflict of interest on the same issue between the same parties. One
of the basic essential ingredients for applying the principle of res
judicata, as stated earlier also, is that the matter which is directly
and substantially in issue in the previous litigation ought not to be
permitted to be raised and adjudicated upon in the subsequent suit.
It is a settled law that the principle of res judicata is applicable not
only between the plaintiff and the defendants but also between the
co-defendants. In applying the principle of res judicata between
the co-defendants, primarily three conditions are necessary to be
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 37
Har Narayan Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh Cantonment & Ors.
fulfilled, namely, (i) there must be a conflict of interest between the
co-defendants; (ii) there is necessity to decide the said conflict in order
to give relief to plaintiff; and (iii) there is final decision adjudicating
the said conflict. Once all these conditions are satisfied, the principle
of res judicata can be applied inter se the co-defendants.
24. In context with the above settled principle, though reference can be
made to several decisions starting from that of Privy Council, but we
consider it appropriate to refer to only one of the latest decisions on
the point rendered by this Court in the case of Govindammal (Dead)
by Legal Representatives and Ors. vs. Vaidiyanathan and Ors.3,
wherein after considering all previous decisions regarding application
of principle of res judicata between co-defendants, this Court culled
out the above three conditions for applying the same.
25. In the light of the above legal position, we find that there was no
conflict of interest between the co-defendants in the earlier Suit No. 8
of 64 inasmuch as the plaintiff-appellant was independently claiming
rights over 0.30 acres of suit land whereas the Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh was claiming rights over 2.55 acres of the land which formed
part of the Estate of Raja without asserting that the land settled in its
favour is the same as claimed by plaintiff-appellant or that there was
any encroachment upon the land settled in its favour. Even assuming
that there was some inter se conflicts between the co-defendants with
regard to the suit land, the adjudication of the said conflict was not
necessary for granting any relief to Maharani who was the plaintiff
in the suit. Since she was claiming the entire Estate of 5.38 acres
of land and her claim was defeated as she was unable to prove the
grant of the said land in her favour with no specific finding by the
court regarding the claims set up by the co-defendants, the inter
se dispute of the co-defendants as raised in the present suit never
came to be adjudicated. Thus, none of the conditions as laid down
in Govindammal (supra) between co-defendants stood fulfilled for
applying res judicata. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances,
we are of the opinion that the principle of res judicata would not
be attracted as the issue in the present suit was neither directly or
indirectly in issue in the previous suit and there was no conflict of
interest between the co-defendants in the said previous suit which if
any never came to be adjudicated upon. Accordingly, the suit as filed
3 [2018] 11 SCR 1092 : (2019) 17 SCC 433
38 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
by the plaintiff-appellant claiming title over the suit land against the
Cantonment Board, Ramgarh is not barred under Section 11 CPC.
26. Having said so, we proceed to examine the respective claims of the
parties on merits, treating the suit as maintainable and not barred
by res judicata.
27. The plaintiff-appellant has set up his claim over the suit land as
described in Schedule ‘A’ to the plaint. The said schedule mentions
0.12 acres of land of plot No.432 and 0.18 acres of land of plot
No.438 totaling 0.30 acres of land situate in village Ramgarh. There
is no dispute that during the said period the Estate of the Raja was
under the management of Court of Wards, its manager had acquired
5.38 acres of additional land including the suit land and the same
was added to the Estate of the Raja. In the year 1942, the Raja
had settled the aforesaid land in favour of the plaintiff-appellant
on 18.10.1942. It was followed by Hukumnama dated 07.04.1943
(Exh.9) which confirmed the above settlement.
28. The above settlement was confirmed by the Additional Collector,
Hazaribagh on enhancement of rent @ Rs.2/- per decimal some
time in the year 1963 and had started realizing rent from the plaintiff-
appellant accordingly.
29. There is no dispute by any person claiming rights under the Raja
that the aforesaid land was not so settled in favour of the plaintiff-
appellant. The Maharani had claimed the entire 5.38 acres of land on
the basis of the maintenance grant executed by Raja in her favour
but her aforesaid claim was not accepted. The Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh on the other hand had staked its claim only in respect of
2.55 acres of land forming part of 5.38 acres of the land but has
nowhere claimed any right, title and interest over the suit land as
claimed by the plaintiff-appellant. The Cantonment Board only on the
basis of the judgment and order dated 16.03.2000 passed in Title
Suit No.8/64 alleges that it has been recognized to be the owner of
the entire 5.38 acres of land by adverse possession and, therefore,
the plaintiff-appellant has no subsisting right in the suit land. The
Cantonment Board further contends that the entire 5.38 acres of
land was leased out by the Raja on 02.06.1931 for a period of 15
years to the Dublin University Mission and, therefore, no part of it
could have been settled by him in favour of the plaintiff-appellant
in the year 1942.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 39
Har Narayan Tewari (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Cantonment Board,
Ramgarh Cantonment & Ors.
30. In respect to the second aspect as raised on behalf of the Cantonment
Board, it is necessary to note that no material or evidence was
adduced by the Cantonment Board to establish that the entire 5.38
acres of land was transferred by way of lease to Dublin University
Mission; not even any oral evidence was adduced to prove such a
transfer restricting the right of the Raja to settle the land in favour
of the plaintiff-appellant. Even otherwise assuming there was such a
lease, it would have expired in June 1946 on completion of 15 year
period in which case the settlement of 1942 and the Hukumnama of
1943 being valid would revive and continue in favour of the plaintiff-
appellant, more particularly with its confirmation by the Additional
Collector and mutation in 1963.
31. In context with the first contention that in Title Suit No.8/64, possession
of the Cantonment Board over the entire 5.38 acres was accepted by
adverse possession, it would be pertinent to note that on perusal of
the said judgment and order and decree would reveal that the court
of first instance in the said suit has not given any finding with regard
to the claim to the plaintiff-appellant (who was defendant No.32 in
the said suit) nor with regard to the claim set up by the Cantonment
Board. It is misconceived to contend that the said judgment and order
accepts the title of the Cantonment Board by adverse possession
on the entire 5.38 acres of land. In the said suit, the Cantonment
Board had claimed rights only in respect of the part of the aforesaid
5.38 acres of land to the extent of 2.55 acres and, therefore, any
observation of the trial court regarding adverse possession of the
Cantonment Board would be deemed to be in respect of the claim
as set up by the Cantonment Board and would not be construed to
be in connection with the entire 5.38 acres of land so as to include
the land of the plaintiff-appellant.
32. The written statement of the Cantonment Board itself as filed in
Title Suit No.8/64 (Exh.12) makes it abundantly clear that upon the
establishment of the Cantonment Board as a temporary measure
in the year 1941, the Raja on being approached permitted it on
06.11.1941 to use 2.55 acres of land consisting of the dispensary
building and other structures along with adjoining land to be used
by the Cantonment Board for a period of six months which was
extended up to 31.12.1943. There was no other settlement of any
land in favour of the Cantonment Board and the Cantonment Board
was in permissive possession of only 2.55 acres of land out of the
40 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
5.38 acres of the entire land of village Ramgarh. The land settled in
favour of the plaintiff-appellant and that in favour of the Cantonment
Board by the Raja were distinct and as such there was no apparent
conflict between them.
33. The plaintiff-appellant by sufficient evidence has proved the settlement
of the suit land by the Raja in his favour. It stands proved by the Amin
report (Exh.8) dated 15.04.1942 and the Hukumnama (Exh.9) dated
07.04.1943 as well as the Rent receipt (Exh.6, 6/A and 7). The order
of the Additional Collector, Hazaribagh dated 07.01.1963 (Exh.16)
directing realization of rent from the plaintiff-appellant also confirms
the above settlement and its subsequent approval by the State on
enhancement of rent. All these documents have not been confronted
by the other side. The fact that the name of the plaintiff-appellant
was also mutated in the revenue records proves it beyond doubt,
in the absence of any contrary evidence that he is in possession of
the suit land. It may also be worth noting that in the earlier suit, the
Cantonment Board has accepted that the plaintiff-appellant has been
realizing rent of the shops existing over the suit land from the tenants.
34. In view of the aforesaid overwhelming unconfronted evidence, the
First Appellate Court manifestly erred in reversing the finding of the
court of first instance that the plaintiff-appellant is in settled possession
of the suit land and he has successfully proved his ownership rights
over the same.
35. Accordingly, the judgment and order of the High Court dated
01.04.2009 and that of the First Appellate Court dated 28.06.2006
are hereby set aside and the judgment and order dated 16.03.2000
passed by the trial court is restored decreeing the title suit of the
plaintiff-appellant but with no order as to costs.
36. The appeal is allowed.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
","Judgment
Dipankar Datta, J.
1. The substantial question arising for decision in this civil appeal is
whether upon admission of an instrument in evidence and its marking
as an exhibit by a court (despite the instrument being chargeable to
duty but is insufficiently stamped), such a process can be recalled
by the court in exercise of inherent powers saved by section 151
of the Code of Civil Procedure1 for the ends of justice or to prevent
abuse of the process of the court.
2. Assail in this civil appeal is to the judgment and order dated 26th
September, 20112 passed by a learned Single Judge of the High
Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru3 whereby His Lordship set aside
the order dated 19th October, 2010 passed by the Court of Additional
Senior Judge-III, Mangalore4 and allowed the petition5 preferred by
the respondent under Article 227 of the Constitution.
3. The facts, relevant for the disposal of the present appeal, are adverted
to in brief hereunder:
a. First Sale Agreement and Sale Deed: On 3rd October, 2003,
a Sale Deed was executed regarding the suit property by one
B. Ramesh Hegde in favour of his wife, who is the respondent
here. This Sale Deed was executed on the strength of a
General Power of Attorney6 dated 16th September, 2003, which
was allegedly executed by one Praveen Shetty in favour of B.
Ramesh Hegde in respect of the suit property, authorizing him
with power to sell the suit property.
b. Second Sale Agreement and Sale Deed: An agreement to
sell the suit property was executed between the appellant and
Praveen Shetty on 11th September, 2003. The appellant paid the
1 CPC, hereafter
2 impugned order, hereafter
3 High Court, hereafter
4 Trial Court, hereafter
5 Writ Petition No. 11653 of 2011 (GM-CPC)
6 GPA, hereafter

Digital Supreme Court Reports
consideration, and a Sale Deed was executed on 8th October,
2003 between the appellant and Praveen Shetty.
c. Civil Suit by the appellant: The appellant instituted a civil suit7
against the respondent, B. Ramesh Hegde, and Praveen Shetty,
seeking a declaration that the Sale Deed dated 3rd October,
2003 was null and void, and not binding on the appellant.
d. Civil Suit by the respondent: Conversely, the respondent also
instituted a civil suit8 against the appellant and Praveen Shetty,
seeking a declaration that the Sale Deed dated 8th October,
2003 was null and void, and not binding on the respondent.
e. Filing of GPA before the Trial Court: In the suit instituted by
the respondent, witness action commenced. B. Ramesh Hegde,
in whose favour the GPA was executed by the respondent, on
6th June, 2010 tendered the GPA in course of his examination-
in-chief. The appellant’s counsel was engaged in another court;
hence, he was unable to appear. The junior counsel did not object
that the GPA was insufficiently stamped and, thus, inadmissible in
evidence. The Trial Court, in the absence of objection, admitted
the GPA in evidence and marked it as an exhibit whereafter the
matter stood adjourned for cross-examination.
f. Interlocutory Applications: On the next hearing date, 25th
June, 2010 to be precise, the appellant filed two interlocutory
applications9 in the suit filed by the respondent. In I.A. No. IX,
the appellant sought a review of the order dated 6th June, 2010,
and in I.A. No. X, it was prayed that the GPA be impounded
on the ground that it has been insufficiently stamped. The
appellant contended that since the GPA was executed in
favour of a third party with power to sell the property, article
41 of the Schedule to the Karnataka Stamp Act, 195710 was
applicable, necessitating payment of requisite stamp duty based
on the market value of the property. The GPA was prepared
only on a stamp paper worth Rs.100, rendering it insufficiently
stamped and in accordance with section 34 of the 1957 Act,
7 O.S. No. 301 of 2003
8 O.S. No. 134 of 2005
9 I.A.s, hereafter
10 1957 Act, hereafter
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 321
G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
an insufficiently stamped document had to be impounded and
a penalty of ten times the duty value paid.
g. The respondent objected to the I.A.s asserting that the appellant
had to avail his remedy under section 58 of the 1957 Act and
that being available, the appellant could not seek a review.
Further, it was claimed that no proof had been furnished that the
appellant’s counsel was otherwise engaged at that time. Lastly,
it was contended that once a document had been admitted in
evidence, the stamp duty could not subsequently be questioned
on the ground that it has been insufficiently stamped, as per
section 35 of the 1957 Act.
4. Vide order dated 19th October, 2010, the Trial Court allowed the I.A.s
and directed the respondent to pay the deficit stamp duty, along with
the penalty, as required for a power of attorney under article 41(eb)
of the Schedule to the 1957 Act.
5. Dissatisfied with the aforesaid order of the Trial Court, the respondent
approached the High Court whereupon the petition was allowed by
the impugned order, inter alia, recording that:
“2. It is evident from the material that the document has
been marked and admitted in evidence and exhibited. It
is the contention of the respondent under order 13 rule 4
there should be a specific statement to the effect that the
document has been so admitted and endorsement shall
be signed and initialed by the Judge. In the absence of
the said requirement, marking of document does not mean
admission of document in evidence. The argument of the
counsel for the respondent is untenable. In the normal
procedure when the document is produced, it is marked
and exhibit number has assigned and beneath the said
exhibit Judge puts his initial. This procedure fully complies
with the requirement under Order 13 Rule 4 of the Act.
Therefore, the contention that the document has not been
properly marked and it should be rejected in evidence
on the ground of insufficiently stamped is untenable. The
trial court will have no jurisdiction to reconsider the issue.
The remedy available for the respondent is only under
section 58 of the Stamp Act. Accordingly, the writ petition
is allowed.”
322 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
6. It is the legality of the impugned order that we are tasked to examine
while answering the question formulated at the beginning of this
judgment.
7. Mr. Chaturvedi, learned counsel for the appellant, while laying
a challenge to the impugned order argued that admission of an
insufficiently stamped instrument in a casual manner by mechanically
marking it as an exhibit, without any application of judicial mind, should
not preclude the court seized of the proceedings from reconsidering
whether such document is sufficiently stamped and could have at all
been admitted in evidence. Various provisions of the 1957 Act were
referred to by him for persuading us to hold that the view taken by
the High Court was grossly erroneous. Accordingly, it was prayed
by him that the impugned order be set aside and the civil appeal be
allowed with liberty to the respondent to take steps in accordance
with the order of the Trial Court.
8. Mr. Guru, learned counsel for the respondent, defended the impugned
order by asserting that it is correct both in law as well as on facts.
It was argued that setting aside of the Trial Court’s order by the
impugned order was indeed justified since the GPA having been
admitted in evidence, such admission could not have been reviewed
by the same court under any circumstance. Emphasis was placed on
the need for an objection to the document’s admissibility being raised
when it was first tendered for being admitted and then marked as
an exhibit. Citing section 35 of the 1957 Act, it was contended that
once an instrument is admitted in evidence, the admission cannot be
questioned by the trial court or any appellate or revisional court; and
that the only remedy that the 1957 Act provides is a revision under
section 58 thereof in the manner as provided. Thus, he submitted that
the civil appeal being devoid of any merit deserved outright dismissal.
9. A short but interesting question has engaged our consideration. There
is no doubt that the GPA is insufficiently stamped. What we need
to consider on facts and in the circumstances is, which of the two
conflicting views taken by the Trial Court and the High Court is right.
10. Despite the GPA having been admitted in evidence and marked as an
exhibit without objection from the side of the appellant, we propose
to hold for the reasons to follow that the Trial Court did have the
authority to revisit and recall the process of admission and marking
of the instrument, not in the sense of exercising a power of review
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 323
G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
under section 114 read with Order XLVII, CPC but in exercise of
its inherent power saved by section 151 thereof, and that the other
remedy made available by the 1957 Act was not required to be
pursued by the appellant to fasten the respondent with the liability
to pay the deficit duty and penalty.
11. We may refer to the statutory framework of the 1957 Act. Sections
33, 34, 35 and 58, to the extent relevant for a decision on this appeal,
read as follows:
“33. Examination and impounding of instruments.-
(1) Every person having by law or consent of parties
authority to receive evidence, and every person in charge
of a public office, except an officer of police, before whom
any instrument, chargeable in his opinion, with duty, is
produced or comes in the performance of his functions,
shall, if it appears to him that such instrument is not duly
stamped, impound the same.
(2) For that purpose every such person shall examine
every instrument so chargeable and so produced or coming
before him, in order to ascertain whether it is stamped with
a stamp of the value and description required by the law
in force in the State of Karnataka when such instrument
was executed or first executed:
Provided that,—
(a) ***
(b) ***
(3) For the purposes of this section, in cases of doubt, the
Government may determine,—
(a) what offices shall be deemed to be public offices; and
(b) who shall be deemed to be persons in charge of public
offices.
34. Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in
evidence, etc.- No instrument chargeable with duty
shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any
person having by law or consent of parties authority to
receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or
324 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
authenticated by any such person or by any public officer,
unless such instrument is duly stamped:
Provided that,—
(a) ***
(b) ***
(c) ***
(d) ***
35. Admission of instrument where not to be
questioned. – Where an instrument has been admitted
in evidence such admission shall not, except as provided
in section 58, be called in question at any stage of the
same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument
has not been duly stamped.
58. Revision of certain decisions of Courts regarding
the sufficiency of stamps. –
(1) When any Court in the exercise of its Civil or Revenue
jurisdiction or any Criminal Court in any proceeding
under Chapter XII or Chapter XXXVI of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898, makes any order admitting
any instrument in evidence as duly stamped or as not
requiring a stamp, or upon payment of duty and a penalty
under Section 34, the Court to which appeals lie from, or
references are made by, such first mentioned Court may,
of its own motion or on the application of the Deputy
Commissioner, take such order into consideration.
(2) If such Court, after such consideration, is of opinion
that such instrument should not have been admitted in
evidence without the payment of duty and penalty under
Section 34, or without the payment of a higher duty and
penalty than those paid, it may record a declaration to that
effect, and determine the amount of duty with which such
instrument is chargeable, and may require any person
in whose possession or power such instrument then is,
to produce the same, and may impound the same when
produced.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 325
G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
(3) When any declaration has been recorded under sub-
section (2), the Court recording the same shall send a
copy thereof to the Deputy Commissioner and, where the
instrument to which it relates has been impounded or is
otherwise in the possession of such Court, shall also send
him such instrument.
(4) The Deputy Commissioner may thereupon,
notwithstanding anything contained in the order admitting
such instrument in evidence, or in any certificate granted
under Section 41, or in Section 42, prosecute any person
for any offence against the stamp law which the Deputy
Commissioner considers him to have committed in respect
of such instrument.
Provided that, -
(a) no such prosecution shall be instituted where the
amount (including duty and penalty) which, according
to the determination of such Court, was payable in
respect of the instrument under Section 34, is paid
the Deputy Commissioner, unless he thinks that the
offence was committed with an intention of evading
payment of the proper duty;
(b) except for the purpose of such prosecution, no
declaration made under this section shall affect the
validity of any order admitting any instrument in
evidence, or of any certificate granted under Section
41.”
(emphasis ours)
12. Read in isolation, a literal interpretation of section 35 of the 1957
Act seems to make the position in law clear that once an instrument
has been admitted in evidence, then its admissibility cannot be
contested at any stage of the proceedings on the ground of it not
being duly stamped. A fortiori, it would follow that any objection
pertaining to the instrument’s insufficient stamping must be raised
prior to its admission.
13. However, section 35 of the 1957 Act is not the only relevant section.
It is preceded by sections 33 and 34 and all such sections are part of
Chapter IV, tiled “Instruments Not Duly Stamped”. Certain obligations
326 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
are cast by section 33 on persons/officials named therein. Should the
presiding officer of the court find the instrument to be chargeable with
duty but it is either not stamped or is insufficiently stamped, he is bound
by section 33 to impound the same. Section 34 places a fetter on
the court’s authority to admit an instrument which, though chargeable
with duty, is not duly stamped. The statutory mandate is that no such
instrument shall be admitted in evidence unless it is duly stamped.
14. The presiding officer of a court being authorised in law to receive
an instrument in evidence, is bound to give effect to the mandate
of sections 33 and 34 and retains the authority to impound an
instrument even in the absence of any objection from any party
to the proceedings. Such an absence of any objection would not
clothe the presiding officer of the court with power to mechanically
admit a document that is tendered for admission in evidence. The
same limitation would apply even in case of an objection regarding
admissibility of an instrument, owing to its insufficient stamping,
being raised before a court of law. Irrespective of whether objection
is raised or not, the question of admissibility has to be decided
according to law. The presiding officer of a court when confronted
with the question of admitting an instrument chargeable with duty
but which is either not stamped or is insufficiently stamped ought
to judicially determine it. Application of judicial mind is a sine qua
non having regard to the express language of sections 33 and 34
and interpretation of pari materia provisions in the Indian Stamp Act,
189911 by this Court. However, once a decision on the objection is
rendered – be it right or wrong – section 35 would kick in to bar any
question being raised as to admissibility of the instrument on the
ground that it is not duly stamped at any stage of the proceedings
and the party aggrieved by alleged improper admission has to work
out its remedy as provided by section 58 of the 1957 Act.
15. Profitable reference may be made to the decision of this Court in Javer
Chand and others v. Pukhraj Surana12. There, provisions of section
36 of the 1899 Act, which is pari materia section 35 of the 1957 Act,
came up for consideration. A Bench of four Hon’ble Judges of this
Court held that when a document’s admissibility is questioned due to
11 1899 Act, hereafter
12 [1962] 2 SCR 333
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 327
G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
improper stamping, it must be decided immediately when presented
as evidence. The relevant paragraph is extracted hereunder:
“4. *** Where a question as to the admissibility of a document
is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped, or has
not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and
there when the document is tendered in evidence. Once the
court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the document in
evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is
closed. Section 35 is in the nature of a penal provision and
has far-reaching effects. Parties to a litigation, where such a
controversy is raised, have to be circumspect and the party
challenging the admissibility of the document has to be alert
to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the
court. The court has to judicially determine the matter as
soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it
is marked as an exhibit in the case. The record in this case
discloses the fact that the hundis were marked as Exts. P-1
and P-2 and bore the endorsement ‘admitted in evidence’
under the signature of the court. It is not, therefore, one
of those cases where a document has been inadvertently
admitted, without the court applying its mind to the question
of its admissibility. Once a document has been marked as
an exhibit in the case and the trial has proceeded all along
on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case
and has been used by the parties in examination and cross-
examination of their witnesses, Section 36 of the Stamp Act
comes into operation. Once a document has been admitted
in evidence, as aforesaid, it is not open either to the trial
court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind
that order. Such an order is not one of those judicial orders
which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same court
or a court of superior jurisdiction.”
(emphasis ours)
16. Once again, addressing a matter concerning section 36 of the 1899
Act, a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court in Ram Rattan
v. Bajrang Lal13 held as follows:
13 [1978] 3 SCR 963 : (1978) 3 SCC 236
328 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“6. When the document was tendered in evidence by the
plaintiff while in witness box, objection having been raised
by the defendants that the document was inadmissible
in evidence as it was not duly stamped and for want of
registration, it was obligatory upon the learned trial Judge
to apply his mind to the objection raised and to decide the
objects in accordance with law. Tendency sometimes is to
postpone the decision to avoid interruption in the process
of recording evidence and, therefore, a very convenient
device is resorted to, of marking the document in evidence
subject to objection. This, however would not mean that
the objection as to admissibility on the ground that the
instrument is not duly stamped is judicially decided; it is
merely postponed. In such a situation at a later stage
before the suit is finally disposed of it would none-the-
less be obligatory upon the court to decide the objection.
If after applying mind to the rival contentions the trial
court admits a document in evidence, Section 36 of the
Stamp Act would come into play and such admission
cannot be called in question at any stage of the same
suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has
not been duly stamped. The court, and of necessity it
would be trial court before which the objection is taken
about admissibility of document on the ground that it is
not duly stamped, has to judicially determine the matter
as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and
before it is marked as an exhibit in the case and where
a document has been inadvertently admitted without the
court applying its mind as to the question of admissibility,
the instrument could not be said to have been admitted
in evidence with a view to attracting Section 36 (see
Javer Chand v. Pukhraj Surana) [AIR 1961 SC 1655] .
The endorsement made by the learned trial Judge that
‘Objected, allowed subject to objection’, clearly indicates
that when the objection was raised it was not judicially
determined and the document was merely tentatively
marked and in such a situation Section 36 would not be
attracted.”
(emphasis ours)

G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
17. The pivotal aspect emerging for consideration on the terms of
sections 33 and 34 of the 1957 Act, with which we are concerned,
is that whether the Trial Court did judicially determine the question
of admissibility. It is here that we need to ascertain the rationale
behind the Trial Court’s approach to go behind admission of the
GPA in evidence and marking thereof as an exhibit, leading to the
order under challenge before the High Court. Relevant portions of
the order of the Trial Court read thus:
“2. *** There are two suits before this court, one is the
present suit and another suit is OS No. 301/03. In the
present suit, the GPA holder of plaintiff filed an affidavit
by way of chief examination in the morning session
and the documents were marked. While marking the
documents he was held up in the court of Civil Judge (Jr.
Dn.), Mangalore and hence no objection regarding the
deficiency of stamp duty on GPA could be raised before
this court. Accordingly the matter has been adjourned for
cross examination of PW1. The alleged GPA is in favour
of third party with power to sell the property and hence
article 41 of the Karnataka Stamp Act 1957 is applicable
and stamp duty on the market value has to be paid on the
same. The GPA is executed on a stamp paper of value of
Rs.100/- only. As per Section 33 of the Karnataka Stamp
Act, 1957, the court shall impound the said GPA even
without the objections by the advocate for 1st defendant.
His absence at the time of chief examination of PW1 is
not intentional but as he was held up in another court.
3. The 1st defendant has also filed IA No. IX under Sec. 114,
R/w. Sec. 151 of CPC to review the order of marking Ex.P2
which is insufficiently stamped and to hear the objections
regarding inadequacy of stamp duty on the similar grounds.
7. The points that arise for consideration are:-
1. Whether Ex.P2 GPA is insufficiently stamped and
plaintiff is liable to pay deficit duty and penalty?
2. Whether the order permitting the plaintiff to mark
the document requires to be reviewed?
8. The points are answered in affirmative for the following:
330 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Reasons
9. *** The clauses are very specific that the power of
attorney has been given powers to sell the properties
and the power of attorney has acted upon the GPA and
has execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff as per
Ex.P3. Under Article 41(e), when the power of attorney is
given for consideration and authorizing the attorney to sell
the immovable property, the duty payable is same duty
as a conveyance for a market value equal to the amount
of the consideration. As stated above, no consideration
has been mentioned in the GPA., but the GPA has been
given authorizing to sell the immovable property. The
GPA has been issued to a third party, … article 41(ab) is
applicable. The learned counsel for plaintiff objected for
considering these applications on the ground that document
is already marked with out any objections and hence the
question of reviewing the order considering the question of
stamp duty at this stage does not arise. As seen from the
order sheet, the plaintiff was examined on 6.6.2010 and
document was marked on same day. Immediately on the
next date of hearing the counsel has filed IA No. IX and
X to consider the aspect of payment of stamp duty and
penalty i.e., on the day on which the matter was posted
for cross examination of PW1. It is certain that the senior
counsel appearing for the plaintiff was not present at the
time of examination of PW1 in chief as the court remembers
that the junior counsel was present and probably being
unaware of the question of stamp duty has not raised
any objections. The court has marked the document as
an exhibit and has put the seal for having marked the
document as to who has produced the document and
admitted through which witness and marked for plaintiff.
No doubt, there is mention that the document is admitted
through PW1 and Ex.P2, but the court has not applied its
mind while marking the document as to whether document
is sufficiently stamped or insufficiently stamped.
10. *** The circumstances under which the application is
being filed and circumstances under which the document
came to be marked, clearly show that the document was
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 331
G.M. Shahul Hameed v. Jayanthi R. Hegde
marked without application of the mind of the court and
without objection of the other side and this court is of
the view that the admissibility of the document could be
considered at this stage.
ORDER
The IA Nos. IX and X are allowed.”
18. On the face of such an order, it does not leave any scope for doubt
that on the date the GPA was admitted in evidence and marked
as an exhibit, the Trial Court did not deliberate on its admissibility,
much less applied its judicial mind, resulting in an absence of judicial
determination. In the absence of a ‘decision’ on the question of
admissibility or, in other words, the Trial Court not having ‘decided’
whether the GPA was sufficiently stamped, section 35 of the 1957 Act
cannot be called in aid by the respondent. For section 35 to come
into operation, the instrument must have been “admitted in evidence”
upon a judicial determination. The words “judicial determination”
have to be read into section 35. Once there is such a determination,
whether the determination is right or wrong cannot be examined
except in the manner ordained by section 35. However, in a case
of “no judicial determination”, section 35 is not attracted.
19. In the light of the aforesaid reasoning of the Trial Court of admitted
failure on its part to apply judicial mind coupled with the absence of
the counsel for the appellant before it when the GPA was admitted
in evidence and marked exhibit, a factor which weighed with the Trial
Court, we have no hesitation to hold that for all purposes and intents
the Trial Court passed the order dated 19th October, 2010 in exercise
of its inherent power saved by section 151, CPC, to do justice as well
as to prevent abuse of the process of court, to which inadvertently
it became a party by not applying judicial mind as required in terms
of sections 33 and 34 of the 1857 Act. We appreciate the approach
of the Trial Court in its judicious exercise of inherent power.
20. Reference to section 58 of the 1957 Act by learned counsel for the
respondent is without substance. The clear language of section 58
refers to a situation, where an order is passed admitting an instrument
in evidence as duly stamped or as one not requiring a stamp, for
its attraction. As evident from a bare reading of the order dated
19th October, 2010, the Trial Court did neither hold the GPA as duly
332 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
stamped or as not requiring a stamp and, therefore, its applicability
was not attracted.
21. We may not turn a blind eye to the fact that the revenue would stand
the risk of suffering huge loss if the courts fail to discharge the duty
placed on it per provisions like section 33 of the 1957 Act. Such
provision has been inserted in the statute with a definite purpose. The
legislature has reposed responsibility on the courts and trusted them to
ensure that requisite stamp duty, along with penalty, is duly paid if an
unstamped or insufficiently stamped instrument is placed before it for
admission in support of the case of a party. It is incumbent upon the
courts to uphold the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp
duty, as the same are crucial for the authenticity and enforceability
of instruments. Allowing an instrument with insufficient stamp duty
to pass unchallenged, merely due to technicalities, would undermine
the legislative intent and the fiscal interests of the state. The courts
ought to ensure that compliance with all substantive and procedural
requirements of a statute akin to the 1957 Act are adhered to by
the interested parties. This duty of the court is paramount, and any
deviation would set a detrimental precedent, eroding the integrity
of the legal system. Thus, the court must vigilantly prevent any
circumvention of these legal obligations, ensuring due compliance
and strict adherence for upholding the rule of law.
22. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, we answer the substantial
question in the affirmative. Finding no error in the order of the Trial
Court dated 19th October, 2010, we set aside the impugned order of
the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, meaning thereby that
the order of the Trial Court is restored. Since proceedings of the civil
suit remained stalled because of pendency of this appeal, we expect
the Trial Court to proceed expeditiously and in accordance with law.
23. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed without any order for costs.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

v.
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
(Civil Appeal No. 4420 of 2024)
19 March 2024
[Dipankar Datta* and Sanjay Kumar, JJ.]","Whether Division Bench of High Court was justified in reversing
the judgment and order of the Single Judge vide which the writ
petition of the Appellant was allowed and the Respondent was
directed to proceed with his candidature for LPG Distributorship.
","Appellant’s candidature for LPG distributorships was cancelled
by Respondent on the ground that the land offered by him for
the showroom, was beyond the advertised location. Appellant
challenged the Cancellation Letter by filing a writ petition before
the High Court. Single Judge allowed the writ petition and directed
HPCL to proceed with the evaluation of the appellant’s candidature
and decide the same within four weeks. HPCL challenged the order
of Ld. Single Judge by filing writ appeal, which was allowed by
way of the impugned order by the Division Bench of High Court.
Following questions were framed by this Court:
(i) Whether the land offered by the appellant for the showroom
is covered by the extent of “Location” stipulated in the
Advertisement and is compliant with the Unified Guidelines?
(ii) Whether the Division Bench was justified in its interference
with the order under challenge before it?
LPG Distributorship – Meaning of the term “Location” in the
Advertisement issued by the Respondent:
Held: There is no reference to any Gram/Village Panchayat in
Part 2 of the Advertisement although such reference is available
under Part 1 because HPCL did not intend the distributor to cater
to any rural area but a ‘Rurban’ area, which has to be given the
meaning attributed to ‘Rurban Vitrak’ in the Unified Guidelines,
which comprises of both rural and urban – If indeed an LPG

distributor were intended to be appointed in village Haripal, the
‘Type of Market/Distributorship’ would have been shown as ‘Rural’
and included in Part 1 and not Part 2 of the Advertisement – Since
there was no specific column for “Gram Panchayat” in Part 2 of
the Advertisement, which was present in Part 1, and the ‘Type of
Market/Distributorship’ was not ‘Rural’, complemented by the lack
of any detail – Apart from Haripal in the “Location” without any
detailed particulars of the place, it is implied that the location of
the concerned showroom was required to be in Haripal block and
any showroom on land located in Haripal block would fall within
the requirements of the Advertisement. [Paras 19 to 24]
LPG Distributorship – Candidature under Advertisement –
Scope of interference by the Court:
Held: It is not for the Court to adjudge the nature of the
Advertisement or the intention of those who were responsible for
drawing it up, but whether the appellant’s candidature fell within the
scope of the ‘Location’ as indicated in the Advertisement.[Para 23]
Advertisement – Binding on issuing Authority:
Held: Law is well settled that when an advertisement is made
inviting applications from the general public for appointment to a
post or for admission to any course or appointment of the present
nature, the advertisement constitutes a representation to the public
and the authority issuing it is bound by such representation – It
cannot act contrary to it. [Para 24]
LPG Distributorship – Cancellation of Candidature of an
applicant – Challenge to – Defence – Reference to pleadings:
Held: The specific words ‘mouza’ and ‘village’ are not mentioned in
the Advertisement and they cannot be defined by reference to the
definitions of the same in the West Bengal Panchayat Act, 1973 –
An order of cancellation of the candidature of an applicant, which is
the subject matter of challenge in a court of law, has to be defended
with reference to the Advertisement and the pleadings and not with
reference to what was in contemplation of the authority issuing the
Advertisement – A court cannot be swayed by the version of a party,
which is not its pleaded case, and it should confine its decision
to the points of assail/defence raised in the pleadings. [Para 25]
LPG Distributorship – Clause/Qualification in the Advertisement
cannot be modified/rewritten by the Court:
826 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Held: It is not open to a writ court, much less an appeal court,
to direct the modification of any clause/qualification in the
Advertisement to suit the interest of any particular candidate or the
issuing authority – Any such direction would amount to re-writing
the clause/qualification mentioned in the Advertisement, which
would be plainly impermissible. [Para 26]

THE APPEAL
1. An intra-court appellate judgment and order1 (“impugned judgment”,
hereafter) of an Hon’ble Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta
(“High Court”, hereafter), reversing the judgment and order2 (“order”,
1 dated 28th March, 2019

hereafter) of a learned Single Judge, is called in question in the instant
civil appeal. Vide the impugned judgment, the Division Bench of the
High Court allowed the writ appeal3 carried by Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation Limited (“HPCL”, hereafter) from the order and set aside
the same. The Single Judge had, while allowing a writ petition4 of Mr.
Tapas Kumar Das (“appellant”, hereafter), directed HPCL to proceed
with his candidature for LPG5 distributorship.
BRIEF RESUME OF FACTS
2. The facts, giving rise to this appeal, lie in a narrow compass.
3. HPCL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (“IOCL”, hereafter) and Bharat
Petroleum Corporation Limited issued a joint advertisement for LPG
distributorships at several locations in the 31st August, 2017 editions
of the Bangla dailies Bartaman and Anandabazar Patrika (“the
Advertisement”, hereafter). Entries bearing SI. Nos. 1 to 607 in the
Advertisement had 10 (ten) columns (“Part 1”, hereafter) and those
from SI. No. 608 onwards had 9 (nine) columns (“Part 2”, hereafter)6.
The header “Gram Panchayat” did not feature in Part 2 and, hence,
had 1 (one) column less than Part 1.
4. Parts 1 and 2 of the Advertisement with the headers and to the extent
relevant for a decision on this appeal, as per the English translation
placed before us, are set out hereunder:

5. Interested in obtaining an LPG distributorship qua Sl. No.624
reserved for a member of the Scheduled Caste community, i.e.,
‘Location’ and ‘Block’ Haripal in the district of Hooghly, the appellant
submitted an online application for the same under the ‘SC’ category
on 16th October, 2017. The appellant’s application was found to be
in order, whereupon he was called upon to participate in the ensuing
computerised draw of lots for selection for the distributorship for
Haripal. Fortune smiled on the appellant and he emerged as winner
in the draw of lots. HPCL informed the appellant vide a letter dated
4th November, 2018 that he had been declared successful and also
that he was required to comply with the instructions contained therein.
Diligently, the appellant deposited a demand draft of Rs. 30,000/-
with HPCL and submitted relevant land documents in compliance
with the letter dated 4th November, 2018.
6. One Sujoy Kumar Das (“added respondent”, hereafter) lodged a
complaint dated 9th November, 2018 with HPCL questioning the
appellant’s candidature on the basis that the land offered by him for
the showroom was in mouza7 Gopinagar and not in mouza Haripal.
Incidentally, the added respondent had participated in a previous
round of selection conducted by HPCL for the same location, i.e.,
Haripal, and his candidature was rejected by HPCL on the ground
7 As per Wilson’s Glossary of Judicial and Revenue Terms of British India, ‘Mauza’ or Mauja in Hindi and
Mauji in Bengali is a village, understanding by that term one or more clusters of habitations, and all the
lands belonging to their proprietary inhabitants : a Mauza is defined by authority to be ‘a parcel or parcels
of lands having a separate name in the revenue records, and of known limits’.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 829
Tapas Kumar Das v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
that the land for the showroom offered by him was not located in
village Haripal. Upon cancellation of the appellant’s candidature, the
Chief Regional Manager of HPCL (“fourth respondent”, hereafter)
intimated the same to the added respondent vide letter dated 2nd
January, 2019 and assured to him refund of Rs. 5,000/- which he
had deposited as complaint fee, shortly.
7. Close on the heels thereof, the fourth respondent addressed a letter
dated 2nd January, 2019 cancelling the appellant’s candidature for
the LPG distributorship (“Cancellation Letter”, hereafter). Therein, it
was stated that the land offered by the appellant for the showroom
at “Plot No. LR-1220, Khatian No. LR-311, Mouza-Gopinagar, Gram
Panchayat-Haripal Ashuthsh (sic, Ashutosh), Block Haripal, District
Hooghly” pursuant to a registered lease dated 16th October, 20188 for
a period of 16 (sixteen) years was beyond the advertised location;
hence, the appellant’s proposed showroom had failed to meet the
eligibility criteria as per clause 8 A(n) of the Brochure for Unified
Guidelines for Selection of LPG Distributorships (“Unified Guidelines”,
hereafter), and the deposit of Rs. 30,000/- would stand forfeited.
8. It was then that the appellant invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the Cancellation
Letter. The Single Judge, noticing that the Advertisement showed
the location of the distributorship as Block Haripal, observed that
“there was no specific requirement of Gram Panchayat or mouza
to disqualify” the appellant’s candidature. Upon being satisfied that
the land offered by the appellant for the showroom was within the
limits of the advertised location, the learned Single Judge allowed
the writ petition, set aside the Cancellation Letter, and directed HPCL
to proceed with the evaluation of the appellant’s candidature and
decide the same within four weeks upon the appellant completing
all required formalities.
9. Aggrieved by the order, HPCL invoked the appellate jurisdiction of
the High Court and laid a challenge thereto. The Division Bench
referred to the definitions of ‘Gram Panchayat’ and ‘mouza’ in the
West Bengal Panchayat Act, 1973 (“Panchayat Act”, hereafter) and
while allowing the appeal by the impugned judgment, held that “mouza
Haripal has a separate and distinct existence”, the “offered land at
8 the date was subsequently corrected vide letter dated 10th January, 2019 to read 16th October, 2017.
830 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
mouza Gopinagar is not what is contemplated in the advertisement
for appointment of LPG distributors at Haripal” and in such view of
the matter HPCL “was justified in coming to the conclusion that the
writ petitioner failed to fulfil the eligibility criteria”.
RIVAL CONTENTIONS
10. Mr. Sudipta Kumar Bose, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellant, seeking our interference with the impugned judgment
submitted inter alia that:
a. The Division Bench fell into error by reading into the
Advertisement, conditions which had not been categorically
laid down by HPCL. The Advertisement did not state that the
showroom was to be located in any particular mouza, and that
the Advertisement did not refer to any Gram Panchayat as the
specific location either.
b. The appellant had been declared as the successful candidate
after due verification of his eligibility and there could have been
no occasion for HPCL to disqualify him on the complaint of the
added respondent, and that too without putting the appellant
on notice.
c. HPCL, having issued the Advertisement, could not have altered
the rules and guidelines after the appellant was declared eligible
and successful.
d. The entries from serial no. 608 onwards in the Advertisement
did not bear any column for Gram Panchayat as the locations
therein were urban or semi-urban; implying that there was
no error in the Advertisement and such an omission was
conscious.
e. The Single Judge had rightly observed that the advertised
location for the concerned showroom was Haripal with reference
to specification of Block Haripal; and since the appellant had
offered land for the showroom at a location within the jurisdictional
limits of Haripal Police Station and within geographical limits
of Haripal Block, consequently, the same should have been
considered to be covered by the advertised location.
11. Mr. Parijat Sinha, learned counsel appearing for HPCL, in support
of upholding the impugned judgment submitted inter alia that:
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 831
Tapas Kumar Das v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
a. The Unified Guidelines are comprehensive in nature and left
no room for ambiguity as to the location requirements to obtain
an LPG distributorship from inter alia HPCL.
b. In the State of West Bengal, villages were not identified as
units of revenue, but they were in fact identified as mouzas.
Therefore, the boundary of any village could only be defined
in terms of mouzas. Hence, the Advertisement had not been
issued for Block Haripal, but only for the mouza/village Haripal
as per the third column of Part 2 of the Advertisement. Hence,
the intention of mentioning Haripal in the third column was to
indicate Haripal mouza/village, and not the cluster of villages/
towns/cities.
c. Clause 8 A(n) of the Unified Guidelines provided for the
requirements of the showroom to be owned/leased by
the concerned applicant desirous of obtaining an LPG
distributorship. A reading of the Unified Guidelines, along with
the fact that the fifth column of Part 2 of the Advertisement
was for the District, the fourth column was for the Block, and
the third column was for the Location, meant that the third
column specified the uniqueness of the location intending it
to be for the concerned village; it would be incorrect to read
the third and fourth columns as being synonymous. Hence, a
mention of Haripal in the third column meant mouza/village
Haripal and not Block Haripal.
d. In this vein, since the appellant’s showroom fell within mouza
Gopinagar, the same made his candidature ineligible; though
located in Block Haripal, it was not within mouza Haripal.
12. Appearing for the added respondent and seeking dismissal of the
appeal, Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned counsel submitted inter alia that:
a. The added respondent was a proper and necessary party in W.P.
1595 (W) of 2019 before the High Court since the Cancellation
Letter had been issued as a consequence of acceptance of
the complaint dated 9th November 2018. Further, the added
respondent’s appeal challenging the order was also decided
vide the impugned common judgment.
b. The added respondent was also an applicant for the LPG
distributorship as per the Advertisement, and that it would be
832 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
prejudicial for him if the impugned judgment were set aside or
modified.
c. HPCL had, on an earlier occasion, rejected the added
respondent’s candidature for LPG distributorship on grounds
similar to the reasons for cancellation of the appellant’s
distributorship and, therefore, was justified in taking a consistent
and uniform stand.
d. Extending any relief to the appellant, on facts and in the
circumstances, could be inappropriate.
Analysis
13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
impugned judgment of the Division Bench, the order of the Single
Judge as well as the other materials on record.
14. The limited issues that we are tasked to decide in this appeal are:
(i) Whether the land offered by the appellant for the showroom
is covered by the extent of “Location” stipulated in the
Advertisement and is compliant with the Unified Guidelines?
(ii) Whether the Division Bench was justified in its interference with
the order under challenge before it?
15. A cursory look at the Advertisement informs us that it contemplated
the location of the relevant distributorships in the manner such that
the fifth column of Part 2 of the Advertisement indicated the ‘District’,
the fourth column the ‘Block’, and the third column the “Location” with
the words “particulars of the place wherever applicable” following it
in brackets. Also, in Part 1 of the Advertisement, as noted above,
there was an additional column for “Gram Panchayat”. This is
conspicuously missing from Part 2.
16. Viewed thus, what we find is that HPCL intended to appoint an LPG
distributor at a location named Haripal, situate within Haripal block
in the district of Hooghly, reserved for SC, with ‘Rurban’ shown as
the Type of Market/Distributorship. Much would, in our opinion, turn
on ‘Rurban’ which was not noticed either by the Single Judge or the
Division Bench, as the discussion follows.
17. In course of arguments, we heard Mr. Sinha submitting that there was
an error in not mentioning the “Gram Panchayat” in the Advertisement
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 833
Tapas Kumar Das v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
for the subject location. In other words, there was a mistake in the
Advertisement insofar as Sl. No.624 is concerned. However, a course
correction measure was sought to be adopted in the written notes of
arguments filed on behalf of HPCL which, as would unfold hereafter,
does more harm than good to its cause. It is stated in the written
notes that “from Sl. No.608 onwards, all of the locations advertised
… were either urban or semi-urban with regard to the nature of the
market/LPG distributorship; hence, the relevant Gram Panchayat was
not mentioned in the said Advertisement”. It is also stated therein that
in terms of the Advertisement, the appellant “ought to have offered
land located within (sic) in village/mouza location – Haripal (column
3), which is the advertised location” (bold in original).
18. HPCL having advertised Haripal as the location within Haripal block
for the LPG distributorship and without there being anything more in
the Advertisement with specifics as to the ‘locality’, the candidature
of the appellant and the land offered by him for the showroom had
to be considered bearing in mind the relevant clauses of the Unified
Guidelines, viz. clauses 1 c. i. and 1 y. defining ‘Rurban Vitrak’9 and
‘Location’10, respectively, and 8 A (n) regarding ‘Showroom’11.
19. It would be convenient at this stage to look at Sl. Nos. 608 to 631
of the Advertisement, comprised in Part 2 (supra). In all but one of
the locations, LPG distributorships were on offer at the instance of
9 Rurban Vitrak: In this document, the word Rural Urban means LPG distributor located in ‘Urban Area’
and also providing service to the LPG Customers in specified ‘Rural Area’, generally covering all villages
falling within 15 Kms. From the municipal limits of the LPG distributorship location and or the area

IOCL. Majorly, the locations have ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’
as ‘Urban’ while the rest are ‘Rurban’. In several of the locations
advertised ranging between Sl. Nos. 608 and 631, except Sl. No.624
being the subject location, the locations within brackets indicate the
locality12 where the concerned OMC13 intended to appoint an LPG
distributor. As and by way of example, one may profitably refer to
Sl. Nos. 613 and 619. While both indicate Kolkata as locations, the
former within brackets has Salt Lake within Bidhannagar Municipality
and the latter China Town within Kolkata Municipal Corporation areas.
We read Salt Lake and China Town as the ‘locality’ in the location
Kolkata to sync locality with ‘Location’. It is also significant to note
another advertised location in the district of Hooghly. Sl. No. 610
indicates that in Nabagram (Konnagar), being the ‘Location’ within
Shrirampur block, IOCL intended to appoint an LPG distributor. We
take judicial notice of the fact that Konnagar is a town and also a
municipality in the district of Hooghly with Nabagram as the locality14.
However, significantly, Sl. No. 624 does not go beyond indicating
Haripal as the location.
20. Judicial notice is also taken of the fact that Haripal is a community
development block being part of Chandannagore sub-division, in the
district of Hooghly, West Bengal. It is true that as per the Census 2011
Report downloaded from www.census2011.co.in, [being Annexure
R-1/1 of the counter affidavit of HPCL filed in this proceeding], Haripal
and Gopinagar are villages within Haripal block but, for reasons more
than one, we are not persuaded to accept the claim of HPCL that it
intended to appoint an LPG distributor at Haripal village.
21. First, the stand taken in the written notes entirely demolishes the
plinth on which the impugned judgment rests. Reference to any village
or mouza, be it Haripal or Gopinagar, is rendered irrelevant in the
circumstances in the light of the ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’ being
shown as ‘Rurban’ in the Advertisement under Column 7, which has
to be given the meaning attributed to ‘Rurban Vitrak’ in the Unified
Guidelines. If appointment of a distributor were intended for a village/

14 ‘gram’ in Nabagram is not to be mistaken for a village.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 835
Tapas Kumar Das v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
mouza, i.e., Haripal, it defies logic why instead of ‘Gramin Vitrak’15,
‘Rurban Vitrak’ was shown as the ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’. It
is also significant to note that if HPCL meant Haripal village as the
intended location for appointment of an LPG distributor, it has not
explained why there is no reference to any Gram/Village Panchayat
in Part 2 (supra) although such reference is available under Part
1 (supra). This, we feel, is obvious because HPCL did not intend
the distributor to cater to any rural area but a ‘Rurban’ area which
comprises of both rural and urban.
22. Secondly, the contention of HPCL that Haripal as shown both under
the columns ‘Block’ and ‘Location’ are not synonymous and that
Haripal should be read and understood as Haripal village appears
to be one advanced in desperation. The appellant, or for that matter
any other individual interested in the distributorship, could not have
possibly projected his own imagination and discover all the facts
and circumstances that were in the contemplation of the officers of
HPCL to be fulfilled by him. At the cost of repetition, Haripal under
the column ‘Location’ appears to be unqualified. In the present
case, Haripal being the advertised location and without mention of
locality but with the ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’ being shown
as ‘Rurban’, it is quite but natural for an individual to perceive that
land offered for the showroom, if not located anywhere in the entire
Haripal block, must at least be located within certain identifiable
limits having relation with Haripal, such as the jurisdictional limits of
Haripal Police Station. If indeed an LPG distributor were intended to
be appointed in village Haripal, the ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’
would undoubtedly have been shown as ‘Rural’ and included in Part
1 (supra) and not Part 2 (supra) of the Advertisement. Unless the
relevant Part and the columns thereunder of the Advertisement are
interpreted in the manner as above, the same would lead to utter
absurdity.
23. The problem can be viewed from another perspective. While
completing our task, it is not for us to adjudge the nature of the
Advertisement or the intention of those who were responsible for
15 Gramin Vitrak: In this document, the word ‘Rural Area’ will have the definition of ‘Rural’ as per census
2011. LPG distributorship located in ‘Rural Area’ will be called as Gramin Vitrak and will service the LPG
Customers of the specified rural area. Generally it will cover all villages falling within 15 KMs from the
boundary limits of the LPG distributorship location and or the area specified by the respective OMCs.
836 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
drawing it up, but whether the appellant’s candidature fell within the
scope of the ‘Location’ as indicated in the Advertisement.
24. Law is well settled that when an advertisement is made inviting
applications from the general public for appointment to a post or
for admission to any course or appointment of the present nature,
the advertisement constitutes a representation to the public and
the authority issuing it is bound by such representation. It cannot
act contrary to it. What bears heavy upon us is that, any person of
reasonable prudence could assume that since there was no specific
column for “Gram Panchayat” in Part 2 (supra) of the Advertisement,
which was present in Part 1, and the ‘Type of Market/Distributorship’
was not ‘Rural’, complemented by the lack of any detail – apart
from Haripal in the “Location” without any detailed particulars of the
place, would imply that the location of the concerned showroom was
required to be in Haripal block and any showroom on land located in
Haripal block would fall within the requirements of the Advertisement.
25. We have also kept in mind that the specific words ‘mouza’ and ‘village’
do not find any mention in the Advertisement and reference to the
definitions of the same in the Panchayat Act by the Division Bench
as well as by Mr. Sinha in course of his submissions is misconceived.
An order of cancellation of the candidature of an applicant, which is
the subject matter of challenge in a court of law, has to be defended
with reference to the Advertisement and the pleadings and not with
reference to what was in contemplation of the authority issuing the
Advertisement. It is the norm that a court cannot be swayed by the
version of a party, which is not its pleaded case, and that it should
confine its decision to the points of assail/defence raised in the
pleadings. Any such argument ought to have been traceable in the
pleadings, and could not simply have been put before this Court as
an afterthought.
26. In a situation akin to this, had the appellant, or any intending
candidate, known in advance of such a narrower requirement, then
they would likely have been more vigilant in fulfilling such criteria
for the location of the distributorship. In arguendo, unfortunately, it
is HPCL’s cross to bear that the Advertisement, if not incorrectly, is
inadequately worded. It is not open to a writ court, much less an
appeal court, to direct the modification of any clause/qualification
in the Advertisement to suit the interest of any particular candidate
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 837
Tapas Kumar Das v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited & Ors.
or the issuing authority even. Any such direction would amount to
re-writing the clause/qualification mentioned in the Advertisement,
which would be plainly impermissible.
27. Turning to the added respondent, we can only sympathize with him. If
at all the added respondent had earlier been the victim of an arbitrary
rejection of his candidature by HPCL, he ought to have challenged
such action by instituting an appropriate proceeding. Not having so
instituted, the present appeal is not an appropriate proceeding where
this Court can look into his grievance and address it.
Conclusion
28. For the reasons aforementioned, the first issue is answered in the
affirmative while the second in the negative.
29. The impugned judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and the
order of the Single Judge restored. The present appeal is, accordingly,
allowed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
30. It is, however, made clear that apart from the questions that we have
decided, no part of our observations shall be treated as expression of
opinion on the further requirements/compliances, if any, with regard
to HPCL proceeding with the appellant’s candidature for the LPG
distributorship. The same may be decided as per the applicable laws
and guidelines by the competent authority of HPCL.
31. Since the Advertisement is more than half a decade old, we hope
and trust that HPCL would henceforth proceed with expedition to
cater to the needs of its future customers.
32. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of accordingly.

HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited
(Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
(Civil Appeal Nos. 3835 – 3836 of 2024)
04 March 2024
[Hrishikesh Roy and Prashant Kumar Mishra, JJ.]","The High Court facilitated the enforcement of the final Award dated
27.09.2014 issued at Singapore International Arbitration Centre
(SIAC). The appellants’ objection to enforcement of the foreign
Award, in terms of s.48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
was rejected and the High Court had also directed that the order of
attachment against the Award Debtors-appellants shall continue to
operate during the execution proceedings to be undertaken by the
respondent-Award Holder. Whether the High Court was correct in
its decision to reject the objection u/s. 48(2)(b) of Indian Arbitration
Act against enforcement of the foreign Award on the grounds of
arbitral bias and violation of public policy. Further, whether the
ground of bias could be raised at the enforcement stage u/s. 48(2)
(b) for being violative of the “public policy of India” and the “most
basic notions of morality or justice”.
","Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.48 – Chapter 1
Part II – Foreign Award – According to the appellants-Award
Debtors , the Presiding Arbitrator, CL, one of the three-
member Arbitral Tribunal, had failed to make a full and frank
disclosure of material facts and circumstances concerning
conflict of interest and therefore the Award rendered by the
Tribunal presided by CL cannot be enforced as it is against
public policy in terms of s.48(2) (b)of the Indian Arbitration
Act – Propriety:
Held: The Award in the instant matter was passed in Singapore,
a New York Convention Country and notified as a reciprocating
territory by India – Chapter 1 Part II of the Indian Arbitration Act
is applicable in the present case – The parties had expressly
chosen Singapore as the seat of Arbitration – It is the seat court
972 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which has exclusive supervisory jurisdiction to determine claims
for a remedy relating to the existence or scope of arbitrator’s
jurisdiction or the allegation of bias – A contrary approach would
go against the scheme of the New York Convention which has
been incorporated in India – The jurisdiction was therefore chosen
based on the perceived neutrality by the parties aligning with the
principle of party autonomy – In the instant case, no setting aside
challenge based on bias was raised before the Singapore Courts
by the appellants within the limitation period – None of the grounds,
which are now being pressed, were raised during the arbitration
or in the time period available to the appellants to apply, to set
aside the Award in Singapore – Bonafide challenges to arbitral
appointments have to be made in a timely fashion and should
not be used strategically to delay the enforcement process – In
other words, the Award Debtors should have applied for setting
aside of the Award before the Singapore Courts at the earliest
point of time – As far as allegations of bias against Presiding
Arbitrator CL is concerned, the High Court after adverting to the
IBA guidelines concluded that there was no identity or conflict of
interest between CL and the award holder, or any of its affiliates
including its holding company – In assessment of this Court, the
High Court correctly suggested that CL neither had a duty to
disclose nor did he fail to discharge his legal duty of disclosure
in accepting the assignment as the Presiding Arbitrator – In the
circumstances here, it cannot be inferred that there was a bias
or likelihood of bias of the Presiding Arbitrator – Award Debtors
therefore cannot claim that there is any violation of the public
policy, which would render the foreign award unenforceable in
India – The award debtors have failed to meet the high threshold
for refusal of enforcement of a foreign award u/s. 48 of the Indian
Arbitration Act – Accordingly, the decision given by the High Court
for enforcement/execution of the foreign award stands approved.
[Paras 27, 28, 29, 35.1, 36, 43]
Arbitration – Foreign Award – Bias – Standard of public policy
in India:
Held: Embracing international standards in arbitration would foster
trust, certainty, and effectiveness in the resolution of disputes on
a global scale – In India, an internationally recognized narrow
standard of public policy must be adopted, when dealing with the
aspect of bias – It is only when the most basic notions of morality
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 973
Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius)
Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
or justice are violated that this ground can be attracted – The
Supreme Court in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd.
v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had noted that the
ground of most basic notions of morality or justice can only be
invoked when the conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction
of fundamental notions or principles of justice – There can be no
difficulty in holding that the most basic notions of morality and
justice under the concept of ‘public policy’ would include bias –
However, Courts must endeavor to adopt international best practices
instead of domestic standards, while determining bias – It is only
in exceptional circumstances that enforcement should be refused
on the ground of bias. [Paras 25 and 26]
Arbitration – Foreign Award – Bias – Challenge at enforcement
stage:
Held: If the ground of arbitral bias is raised at the enforcement
stage, it must be discouraged by the Courts to send out a clear
message to the stakeholders that Indian Courts would ensure
enforcement of a foreign Award unless it is demonstrable that there
is a clear violation of morality and justice – The determination of
bias should only be done by applying international standards –
Refusal of enforcement of foreign award should only be in a rare
case where, non-adherence to International Standards is clearly
demonstrable. [Para 42]

the Arbitration Petition No. 833 of 2015 and Notice of Motion No. 2475
of 2016 respectively whereunder, the High Court has facilitated the
enforcement of the final Award dated 27.09.2014 issued in the SIAC
Arbitration No. 088 of 2012. The appellants’ objection to enforcement
of the foreign Award, in terms of Section 48 of the Arbitration and

affidavits as regards their properties.
Facts
5. This case has a chequered history and it is essential to note the
background facts for the present challenge.
5.1. The respondent-HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited (for
short “HSBC”) is a company incorporated under the laws of
Mauritius. The appellant No. 1 Avitel Post Studioz Limited (for
short “Avitel India”) is a company incorporated under the laws
of India and it is the parent company of Avitel Group. It holds
entire issued capital of Avitel Holdings Limited, which in turn,
holds entire issued share capital of Avitel Post Studioz FZ LLC.
Appellant No. 2 is the founder of Avitel Post Studioz Limited,
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 977
Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius)
Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
being its Chairman and Director, while Appellant Nos. 3 and 4
are his sons, who are directors of Appellant No. 1.
5.2. On 21.4.2011, a Share Subscription Agreement was entered
between HSBC & Avitel India whereby HSBC made an
investment in the equity capital of Avitel India for a consideration
of US 60 million dollars to acquire 7.8% of its paid-up capital. This
agreement contained an arbitration clause which provided that the
disputes shall be finally resolved at the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (SIAC). Singapore was designated as the
seat of arbitration and Part I of the Indian Arbitration Act was
excluded, except Section 9 thereof. Thereafter, the parties
also entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement(6.5.2011) which
defined the relationship between the parties and contained an
identical arbitration clause.
5.3. It is the case of HSBC(Award Holder) that the appellants at a
very advanced stage made certain representations to HSBC
stating that the investment of US$ 60 Million was required
to service a significant contract with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
5.4. Following the investment, according to HSBC, the appellants
ceased to provide any information regarding the contract with
BBC, despite numerous follow-up attempts. At this stage,
HSBC engaged their independent investigation agency, where
it was discovered that the purported BBC Contract was non-
existent and the invested amount was siphoned off to different
Companies.
5.5. On 11.05.2012, HSBC invoked the arbitration clause under the
SIAC Rules and claimed damages of US$ 60 million from the
appellants. On 14.5.2012, SIAC Appointed Mr. Thio Shen Yi,
SC as an Emergency Arbitrator. On 17.5.2012, the appellants’
challenge to the appointment of the Emergency Arbitrator was
considered by SIAC & Rejected. On 28.05.2012 and 29.5.2012,
the emergency arbitrator passed two interim Awards, in favour of
HSBC inter alia, directing the appellants to refrain from disposing
of/diminishing the value of their assets upto US$ 50 million. On
27.7.2012, the Emergency Arbitrator made an amendment to
Interim Awards granting further relief to HSBC by rejecting to
desist investigations against Avitel Dubai and Avitel Mauritius.
978 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
5.6. According to HSBC, the appellants made several attempts
to delay and frustrate the proceedings. The arbitral tribunal
consisted of three members. Mr. Christopher Lau, SC, was
the Chairman, while Justice F.I. Rebello (retired) and Dr.
Michael Pryles were members of the arbitral tribunal. On
27.09.2014, the tribunal rendered its final award and directed
the appellants to pay US$ 60 million as damages for fraudulent
misrepresentations.
5.7. The respondent had initiated proceedings under Section 9 of
the Indian Arbitration Act before the Bombay High Court. A
direction was issued to the appellants to deposit US$ 60 million
for the purpose of enforcement of the Award. Aggrieved by
the same, the appellants filed a Special Leave Petition before
this Court where it was contended, inter alia, that the dispute
is non-arbitrable under Indian law as it involved allegations
of fraud which included serious criminal offenses such as
forgery and impersonation. Settling the law on the arbitrability
of fraud, this Court in the earlier round in Avitel Post Studioz
v HSBC PI Holdings1, held that the dispute was arbitrable and
that HSBC had a strong prima facie case in the enforcement
proceedings, in the context of Section 9 proceedings in which
HSBC had sought maintenance of the entire claim amount in
Avitel’s bank account.
5.8. Since the appellants failed to abide by the direction given by
this Court to deposit the amount, a contempt proceeding was
initiated against them. On 11.07.2022, this Court found that Avitel
had deliberately and willfully disobeyed its order and hence, the
appellants were directed to remain present before this Court.
The Appellant Nos.2 to 4 however went abroad defying the
direction given by this Court, as a result of which, warrants and
look-out notices were also issued, with a further direction to the
Ministry of External Affairs and Central Bureau of Investigation
for issuance of Red-Corner Notice. Ultimately, appellant Nos.2 to
4 surrendered and despite tendering an unconditional apology,
this Court refused to accept the same and for their conduct,
appellant Nos. 2 to 4 were sentenced to imprisonment.

Submissions
6. According to the appellants, the Presiding Arbitrator, Mr. Christopher
Lau of the three-member Arbitral Tribunal, had failed to make a full
and frank disclosure of material facts and circumstances concerning
conflict of interest and therefore the Award rendered by the Tribunal
presided by Mr. Lau cannot be enforced as it is against public policy
in terms of Section 48(2)(b)of the Indian Arbitration Act.
7. The counsel for the appellants refers to the IBA Guidelines on Conflict
of Interest in International Arbitration, 2004 (“IBA Guidelines”) along
with the Red, Orange and Green lists appended thereto covering
matters concerning disclosure and conflict of interest to argue that
the High Court ought to have refused enforcement of the Award. The
specific contention is that the Presiding Arbitrator failed to disclose
his conflict of interest to adjudicate the dispute. According to the
Award Debtors the independence and impartiality of the Presiding
Arbitrator was compromised, as per General Standard 3 of the IBA
Guidelines.
8. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent (Award
Holder) would submit that the concerned party here is HSBC PI
Holdings (Mauritius) Limited, which is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings
PLC (United Kingdom). The other subsidiary is HSBC (Singapore)
Nominees Pte Ltd. which is alleged to have a contractual association
with Wing Tai. The HSBC (Singapore) held 6.29% of Wing Tai’s equity
capital on a trustee/nominee basis, as of 15.09.2014. But the said
Wing Tai has no relationship with the Award Holder and is not part
of the HSBC Group.
9. Insofar as the Presiding Arbitrator Mr. Christopher Lau is concerned,
the respondent submits that he has been an independent non-
executive Director of Wing Tai since 28.10.2013 and also the
Chairman of the Audit and the Risk Committee of Wing Tai. But Mr.
Lau is not an employee of Wing Tai and therefore it is contended
that it is wrong to say that he cannot discharge responsibility as
an independent arbitrator or was incapacitated in any manner, in
rendering the final Award dated 27.09.2014.
10. Initially, the Award Holders argued before the High Court that bias
could not be raised under the concept of “public policy of India”.
However, later on, submissions were made to demonstrate that
980 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
even if it is accepted for the sake of argument that the issue could
be raised at the stage of enforcement, no disclosure was required
on the part of the arbitrator.
11. Before this Court, the appellants attempted to raise an additional
challenge to the award under Section 48(1)(b) of the Indian Arbitration
Act on account of ‘inability to present their case’.
12. Another ground mentioned in the SLP was to consider the effect
of the dictum of the five-judge bench of this Court in NN Global
Mercantile Private Ltd. v M/s Indo Unique Flame Ltd2 (for short “NN
Global”) delivered on 25.04.2023 as per which the Share Subscription
Agreement being insufficiently stamped would be unenforceable in
India. However, during the pendency of the present proceedings, the
Supreme Court in In Re: Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements
under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996 and the Indian Stamp
Act,18993 delivered on 13.12.2023 has overruled the decision in NN
Global (supra). The 7-judge bench had noted, inter alia, that the
purpose of the Stamp Act,1899 is to protect the interests of revenue
and not arm litigants with a weapon of technicality by which they
delay the adjudication of the lis. This may be the reason why the
Counsel chose not to orally argue on this point.
13. The two grounds noted above, need not detain us as the fundamental
issue that requires determination is whether enforcement can be
refused on the ground of bias. In these proceedings, challenging
the High Court’s judgment, the appellants reiterate their contention
that the enforcement of the award is impermissible on the ground
of arbitral bias and is contrary to the “public policy of India” as per
Section 48(2)(b) of the Indian Arbitration Act.
Discussion
14. Against this background, the consideration to be made in these
matters is whether the High Court was correct in its decision to
reject the objection under Section 48(2)(b) of Indian Arbitration Act
against enforcement of the foreign Award on the grounds of arbitral
bias and violation of public policy. This raises a further question as
to whether the ground of bias could be raised at the enforcement

stage under Section 48(2)(b) for being violative of the “public policy
of India” and the “most basic notions of morality or justice”?
15. India was one of the earliest signatories to the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (for
short “New York Convention”)4. The New York Convention superseded
the Geneva Convention of 1927 to facilitate the enforcement of
foreign Arbitral Awards5. Article V(2) of the New York Convention
reads as under:
“2. Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may
also be refused if the competent authority in the country
where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that:
(a) The subject matter of the difference is not capable
of settlement by arbitration under the law of that
country; or
(b) The recognition or enforcement of the award would
be contrary to the public policy of that country.”
16. The precursors to the New York Convention on the contrary provided
for an expansive scope for invoking the public policy ground based
on the violation of the “fundamental principles of the law”. Although
the notion that ‘public policy’ is ‘a very unruly horse’ has gained
traction over the years6, one would also do well to remember
the words of Lord Denning who said that, “With a good man in
the saddle, the unruly horse can be kept in control.”7 This would
suggest that a proper understanding of this branch of law by the
horse rider would be necessary. In that context, one of the earliest
cases that dealt with the aspect of “public policy” and the general
pro-enforcement bias of the New York Convention was the decision
in Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Societe Generale de
L’Industrie du Papier,8 where the United States Court of Appeals,
Second Circuit noted:

“8. …The general pro-enforcement bias informing the
Convention and explaining its supersession of the Geneva
Convention points toward a narrow reading of the public
policy defense. An expansive construction of this defense
would vitiate the Convention’s basic effort to remove
preexisting obstacles to enforcement… Additionally,
considerations of reciprocity — considerations given
express recognition in the Convention itself— counsel
courts to invoke the public policy defense with caution
lest foreign courts frequently accept it as a defense to
enforcement of arbitral awards rendered in the United
States.
9. We conclude, therefore, that the Convention’s public
policy defense should be construed narrowly. Enforcement
of foreign arbitral awards may be denied on this basis only
where enforcement would violate the forum state’s most
basic notions of morality and justice.”
17. The above decision has been followed in various jurisdictions
including the Supreme Court of India in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd.
v. General Electric Co9. The articulation of the “forum State’s most
basic notions of morality and justice” has been legislatively adopted
in the Indian Arbitration Act,1996. The legal framework concerning
enforcement of certain foreign awards in International Commercial
Arbitration is contained in Part II of the said Act. In this jurisdiction,
we must underscore that minimal judicial intervention to a foreign
award is the norm and interference can only be based on the
exhaustive grounds mentioned under Section 48.10 A review on the
merits of the dispute is impermissible11. This Court in Vijay Karia v.
Prysmian Cavi E. Sistemi SRL,12 had noted that Section 50 of the
Indian Arbitration Act,1996 does not provide an appeal against a
foreign award enforced by a judgment of a learned Single Judge of
a High Court and therefore the Supreme Court should only entertain
the appeal with a view to settle the law. It was noted that the party

resisting enforcement can only have “one bite at the cherry” and when
it loses in the High Court, the limited scope for interference could
be merited only in exceptional cases of “blatant disregard of Section
48”. This principle of pro-enforcement bias was further entrenched
by the Supreme Court in Union of India v Vedanta13.
18. At this point, we may also note that Courts in some countries have
recognized that when applying their own public policy to Convention
Awards, they should give it an international and not a domestic
dimension14. The Arbitration legislation in France15, for instance,
makes an explicit distinction between national and international
public policy, limiting refusal of enforcement only to the latter ground.
Scholars have noted that the New York Convention’s structure and
objectives argue strongly against the notion that reliance should be
placed on local public policies without international limitations.16 The
objective behind such a distinction is to make it less difficult to allow
enforcement on public policy grounds. Most Courts have interpreted
the public policy exception extremely narrowly17.
19. The Indian Supreme Court in Renusagar (supra) had noted that
there is no workable definition of international public policy, and
“public policy” should thus be construed to be the “public policy of
India” by giving it a narrower meaning. Later on, in Shri Lal Mahal
Ltd. v Progetto Grano SpA18, the Supreme Court held that the wider
meaning given to ‘public policy of India’ in the domestic sphere under
Section 34(2)(b)(ii) would not apply where objection is raised to
the enforcement of the Award under Section 48(2)(b) of the Indian
Arbitration Act. This would indicate that the grounds for resisting
enforcement of a foreign award are much narrower than the grounds
available for challenging a domestic award under Section 34 of the
Indian Arbitration Act.

20. At this point, we may also benefit by noting that the International
Law Association issued recommendations19 at a conference held
in New Delhi in 2002 on international commercial arbitration and
advocated using only narrow and international standards, while
dealing with “public policy”. The recommendations have been
regarded as reflective of best international practices. The ILA also
defined international public policy as follows:
""(i) fundamental principles, pertaining to justice or
morality, that the State wishes to protect even when
it is not directly concerned;
(ii) rules designed to serve the essential political, social
or economic interests of the State, these being known
as ‘lois de police’ or ‘public policy rules’; and
(iii.) the duty of the State to respect its obligations towards
other States or international organizations.”
21. Being a signatory to the New York Convention, we must therefore
adopt an internationalist approach20. What follows from the above
is that there is a clear distinction between the standards of public
policy applicable for domestic arbitration and international commercial
arbitration. Proceeding with the aforedeclared proposition to have
a narrow meaning to the doctrine of public policy and applying an
international outlook, let us now hark back to whether a foreign Award
can be refused enforcement on the ground of bias.
22. Even though the New York Convention does not explicitly mention
“bias”, the possible grounds for refusing recognition of a foreign
award are contained in Article V(1)(d)(irregular composition of
arbitral tribunal), Article V(1)(b) (due process) and the public policy
defence under Article V(2)(b). Courts across the world have applied
a higher threshold of bias to prevent enforcement of an Award than
the standards set for ordinary judicial review21. Therefore, Arbitral

Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
awards are seldom refused recognition and enforcement, considering
the existence of a heightened standard of proof for non – recognition
and enforcement of an award, based on alleged partiality22. It invokes
a higher threshold than is applicable in cases of removal of the
arbitrator.23 This is for the reasons that, greater risk, efforts, time,
and expenses are involved in the non-recognition of an award as
against the removal of an arbitrator during the arbitral proceedings.
23. What is also essential to note is that Courts across the world do
not adopt a uniform test while dealing with allegations of bias24. The
standards for determining bias vary across different legal systems
and jurisdictions25. English Courts26, for instance, adopt the “informed
or fair minded” observer test to conclude whether there is a “real
possibility of bias”. Australia27 adopts the “real danger of bias” test and
Singapore28 prefers the standard of “reasonable suspicion” rejecting
the “real danger of bias” test. Therefore, the outcome of a challenge
on the ground of bias would vary, depending on domestic standards.
24. Cautioning against applying domestic standards at the enforcement
stage, Gary Born29 emphasizing on the adherence to international
standards, makes the following observation:
“In light of developing sources of international standards
with regard to arbitrators’ conflict of interest, it should
be possible to identify and apply international minimum
standards of impartiality and independence...
More generally, in considering whether to deny recognition
of an award under Article V, national courts should not
apply domestic standards of independence and impartiality
without regard to their international context. Although

national standards of independence and impartiality may
be relevant to identifying international standards, just
as domestic standards of procedural fairness can be
relevant under Article V(1)(b), these standards should be
considered with caution in international contexts. ….Only
in rare cases should domestic standards of independence
or impartiality be relied upon to produce a different result
from that required by international standards”.
25. Embracing international standards in arbitration would foster trust,
certainty, and effectiveness in the resolution of disputes on a global
scale. The above discussion would persuade us to say that in India,
we must adopt an internationally recognized narrow standard of public
policy, when dealing with the aspect of bias. It is only when the most
basic notions of morality or justice are violated that this ground can
be attracted. This Court in Ssangyong Engineering & Construction
Co. Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)30 had noted
that the ground of most basic notions of morality or justice can only
be invoked when the conscience of the Court is shocked by infraction
of fundamental notions or principles of justice.
26. In view of the above discussion, there can be no difficulty in holding
that the most basic notions of morality and justice under the concept
of ‘public policy’ would include bias. However, Courts must endeavor
to adopt international best practices instead of domestic standards,
while determining bias. It is only in exceptional circumstances that
enforcement should be refused on the ground of bias.
27. Let us now turn to the present facts. The Award in this matter was
passed in Singapore, a New York Convention Country and notified31
as a reciprocating territory by India. Chapter 1 Part II of the Indian
Arbitration Act is applicable in the present case. The parties had
expressly chosen Singapore as the seat of Arbitration. It is the seat
court which has exclusive supervisory jurisdiction to determine
claims for a remedy relating to the existence or scope of arbitrator’s
jurisdiction or the allegation of bias32. A contrary approach would go

Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius)
Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
against the scheme of the New York Convention which has been
incorporated in India. The jurisdiction was therefore chosen based
on the perceived neutrality by the parties aligning with the principle
of party autonomy. Interestingly in the present case, no setting aside
challenge based on bias was raised before the Singapore Courts
by the appellants within the limitation period. In this context, the
Bombay High Court in a judgment in Perma Container (UK) Line
Limited v Perma Container Line (India) Ltd33 had noted that since the
objection of bias was not raised in appropriate proceedings under
the English Arbitration Act,1996, it could not be raised at the post-
award Stage. Similarly, this Court in Vijay Karia (supra) had noted
that no challenge was made to the foreign award under the English
Arbitration Law, even though the remedy was available. Rejecting
the challenge to the award on the ground of bias, the Court in Vijay
Karia (supra) remarked that the Award Debtors were indulging in
“speculative litigation with the fond hope that by flinging mud on a
foreign arbitral award, some of the mud so flung would stick”. Similar
view has also been taken by the German Supreme Court in Shipowner
(Netherlands) v Cattle and Meat Dealer (Germany)34, where it was
held that the objection of bias must be first raised in the Country
of origin of the Award and only if the objection was rejected or was
impossible to raise, could it be raised at the time of enforcement.
28. In the present case also, the Award Holders had challenged the
appointment of Mr. Christopher Lau SC and Dr Pryles before SIAC
only on the ground that the Tribunal had intentionally fixed November
2013 for hearing knowing that it coincided with the Diwali vacation
and that the Indian counsel would therefore not be available. This
challenge was dismissed by the SIAC Committee of the Court of
Arbitration in its decision dated September 13, 2014. Therefore,
none of the other grounds now being pressed were raised during
the arbitration or in the time period available to the appellants to
apply, to set aside the Award in Singapore.
29. It needs emphasizing that bonafide challenges to arbitral appointments
have to be made in a timely fashion and should not be used
strategically to delay the enforcement process. In other words, the
33 2014 SCC OnLine Bom 575
34 Dutch Shipowner v. German Cattle and Meat Dealer, Bundesgerichtshof, Germany, 1 February 2001,
XXIX Y.B.Com. Arb. 700 (2004)
988 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Award Debtors should have applied for setting aside of the Award
before the Singapore Courts at the earliest point of time.
Implications of the IBA Guidelines
30. The High Court in this case applied the reasonable third-person
test contained in the IBA Guidelines to conclude that there is no
requirement of disclosure and bias. The IBA Guidelines are a collective
effort of the arbitration community to define as to what constitutes
bias. However, bias has to be determined on a case-to-basis but
Courts should attempt to apply international standards, while dealing
with challenges at the enforcement stage.
31. The implications of the IBA Guidelines and their application will now
have to be considered.
32. The IBA Guidelines have also been adopted in the V and VII Schedule
to the Indian Arbitration Act and since the Award here is dated
27.09.2014, the IBA Guidelines of the year 2004 would be relevant
and applicable. The working group of the IBA had determined the
standards/guidelines to bring about clarity and uniformity of application
and accordingly, the Red, Orange and Green lists were appended
to the Guidelines, to ensure consistency and to avoid unnecessary
challenges and withdrawals and removals of arbitrators. The IBA
Guidelines require an arbitrator to refuse appointment in case of
any doubts as to impartiality or independence. The Arbitrator is also
expected to disclose such facts or circumstances to the parties which
might compromise the arbitrator’s impartiality or independence. In the
event of any doubt on whether an arbitrator should disclose certain
facts or circumstances, the issue should be resolved in favour of
disclosure. This is because an arbitrator is not expected to serve in
a situation of conflict of interest. An arbitrator is also under a duty
to make reasonable enquiry to investigate any potential conflict of
interest.
33. The relevant entries in the non-waivable Red list, the waivable Red
list, the Orange list and the Green list would suggest that those were
intended to ensure the fairness of the process and also make certain
that the arbitrator is impartial and also independent of the parties.
Such position of the arbitrator vis-à-vis the dispute should exist not
only while accepting the appointment but must continue throughout
the entire arbitration proceeding until it terminates.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 989
Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius)
Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
34. In the impugned judgment, the High Court adverted to the IBA
Guidelines in some detail and noticed that Mr. Christopher Lau
(Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal) was an independent non-executive
Director of two companies – Wing Tai and Neptune. The learned
judge then considered whether he ought to have disclosed such
relationship before taking up the assignment of arbitration. The
Court noticed that the Award Debtors raised an omnibus objection
and had invoked the non-waivable Red list as well as the waivable
Red list as also the Orange list of the IBA Guidelines to claim that
the arbitrators were under a duty of disclosure. With such broad-
based contentions, the appellants urged that Mr. Lau having failed to
disclose the circumstances, the likelihood of bias was very strong and
this would vitiate the foreign Award, sought to be enforced in India.
35. Adverting to the specific entries in the IBA Guidelines, pertaining to
the alleged bias of Mr. Christopher Lau (the Chairman of the Arbitral
Tribunal), the High Court reached the following conclusion:
35.1. The circumstance alleged by the award debtor for arbitral bias
is the business interaction between one of the group companies
of the award holder with independent private companies i.e.,
Wing Tai and Neptune wherein Mr. Lau was an independent
non-executive director. However, neither Wing Tai or Neptune
fall within the definition of “affiliate” of the award holder as
per the IBA Guidelines. It was therefore concluded that no
reasonable third person would conclude that justifiable doubts
arise about impartiality or independence of Mr. Lau. Thus, there
exists no identity or conflict of interest between Mr. Lau and
the award holder, or any of its affiliates including its holding
company i.e. HSBC PLC (UK).
35.2. While the award debtors’ suggest their case implies a need
for disclosure beyond the ‘Red’ or ‘Orange’ lists, and the
inapplicability of the ‘Green list, the ‘reasonable third person’
test is the measure for assessing conflict of interest. The High
Court concluded that the award debtors have not established
that an impartial observer, aware of all facts, would doubt
Mr. Lau’s impartiality or independence and consequently, the
likelihood of bias of the arbitrator is not discernible.
35.3. The award holder provided ample evidence countering the
award debtors’ claims about its affiliate’s roles as book-runners
990 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and underwriters with Wing Tai and Neptune, by showing
joint participation of various other banks. The allegation of a
significant shareholding by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
award holder’s affiliate in Wing Tai and Neptune was found
unsupported by evidence. The affiliate was one amongst
many in the fund-raising and held the shares in trust during
the course of business.
35.4. Even upon applying the subjective approach for disclosure,
wherein the disclosure requirement is viewed from the Award
Debtors’ point of view, certain limitations apply, as per the
Green list of the IBA Guidelines. Placing reliance upon Clauses,
4.5 and 4.53 of the Green list, the learned Judge of the High
Court found no conflict of interest between the arbitrator and
the award holder or its affiliates. In case, the circumstances
alleged fall under the green list, no duty of disclosure is owed
by the arbitrator.
36. The above discussion in the impugned judgment in our assessment
correctly suggests that Mr. Christopher Lau neither had a duty to
disclose nor did he fail to discharge his legal duty of disclosure
in accepting the assignment as the Presiding Arbitrator. In the
circumstances here, we cannot infer bias or likelihood of bias of the
Presiding Arbitrator. Award Debtors therefore cannot claim that there
is any violation of the public policy, which would render the foreign
award unenforceable in India.
37. Nevertheless, it would also be appropriate to address one specific
contention raised by the Award Debtors on the communication
addressed by Mr. Christopher Lau to an enquiry made on 03.02.2016,
by one Ms. Pauline. In his response, Mr. Lau refused to accept the
suggested assignment stating that there is conflict of interest in his
taking action against HSBC. The circumstances under which the
above communication was addressed by Mr. Lau are explained in
detail in Mr. Lau’s letter dated 26.04.2016. A reading of the response
would show the reason for the response to Ms. Pauline. It would
also additionally confirm that Mr. Christopher Lau during the phase
when he acted as the Presiding Arbitrator between the appellants
and the respondent, was not subject to any conflict of interest. He
is held to have duly complied with the disclosure obligation and no
bias or improper conduct can be attributed to rendition of the Award
dated 27.09.2014 by Mr. Lau, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 991
Avitel Post Studioz Limited & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius)
Limited (Previously Named Hpeif Holdings 1 Limited)
38. Another point on the above aspect i.e. the timing of the communication
would also need our attention. The communication by Ms. Pauline
was made in the year 2016, much after the final Award was rendered
on 27.09.2014. When the explanation of Mr. Christopher Lau in his
communication dated 26.04.2016 is examined in the context of the
roving query made by the third party, well beyond the Award, we
have no hesitation to hold that there was no disability on the part of
Mr. Lau to conduct the arbitral proceedings between the appellants
and the respondent.
39. We, therefore, conclude that there is no bias factor operating against
Mr. Lau that would violate the most basic notions of morality and
justice or shock the conscience of the Court.
Onerous Travails
40. This case has unfortunately seen a protracted and arduous battle
to enforce an award for over 10 long years, with multiple phases
of litigation. The arbitration itself commenced in Singapore on
11.05.2012, when notice of arbitration was issued by the respondent.
Then the SIAC Emergency Awards were rendered on 28.05.2012
and 29.05.2012. Proceedings were then initiated by the award
holder under S. 9 of Indian Arbitration Act at the Bombay High Court,
seeking deposit of security amount to the extent of their claims. In the
meanwhile, the award debtors’ objections on the grounds of jurisdiction
were dismissed by the arbitral tribunal through a Final Partial Award
on 17.12.2012. In the Section 9 proceedings, the appellants were
directed to deposit a certain sum for enforcement of the award. The
award debtor challenged the same before the Supreme Court, which
was subsequently dismissed and culminated in an order to maintain
the specified amount in the award debtor’s account. However, the
award debtors’ failure to maintain their account to the ordered extent,
led to the contempt proceedings before the Supreme Court, which
were disposed of vide orders dated 02.09.2022 & 09.09.2022.
41. Meanwhile, the Final Award was issued on 27.09.2014, which was
sought to be set aside by the award-debtor through an application
under 34 of the Indian Arbitration Act before the High Court. The
same was dismissed as not maintainable on 28.09.2015. An appeal
against the same was filed & dismissed subsequently. Simultaneously
the award holder sought to enforce the award through an Arbitration
Petition before the High Court. As a result, the enforcement
992 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
proceedings culminated in the impugned orders dated 25.04.2023 of
the High Court whereby the final award was rendered enforceable.
42. This long list of events points to a saga of the award-holder’s
protracted and arduous struggle to gather the fruits of the Award. The
Award Debtors raised multiple challenges and also defied the Court’s
order. They had to serve jail time for such contemptuous actions. In
this backdrop, the travails of Award holders suggest a Pyrrhic victory.
It is not unlike the situation articulated by the playwright & author
Oscar Wilde who commented - “In this world, there are only two
tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting
it.”35 As can be noticed, in this case, despite the award being in their
favour, the award-holders found themselves embroiled in multiple
litigations in different forums by the concerted and unmerited action
of the appellants. It will bear mention here, that in every forum the
award debtors have lost and Courts’ verdicts are in the favour of
the award holders. Despite this, the benefit of the foreign award is
still to reach the respondents. This sort of challenge where arbitral
bias is raised at the enforcement stage, must be discouraged by our
Courts to send out a clear message to the stakeholders that Indian
Courts would ensure enforcement of a foreign Award unless it is
demonstrable that there is a clear violation of morality and justice. The
determination of bias should only be done by applying international
standards. Refusal of enforcement of foreign award should only be
in a rare case where, non- adherence to International Standards is
clearly demonstrable.
43. The High Court in this matter has rightly held that the award-debtors
have failed to substantiate their allegation of bias, conflict of interest
or the failure by the Presiding Arbitrator to render disclosure to
the parties, as an objection to the enforcement of the award. The
award debtors have failed to meet the high threshold for refusal
of enforcement of a foreign award under Section 48 of the Indian
Arbitration Act. Accordingly, the decision given by the High Court for
enforcement/execution of the foreign award stands approved. The
appeals are found devoid of merit.
44. Even as the appeals filed by the award debtors are dismissed, the
respondents, notwithstanding their victory in all the legal battles until

now, must not be allowed to feel that theirs is a case of winning the
battle but losing the war. In the circumstances, we emphasize the
need for early enforcement of the foreign award by the competent
forum, without showing any further indulgence to the award debtors. It
is ordered accordingly. The appeals stand dismissed on these terms.

Rajesh Monga v. Housing Development Finance
Corporation Limited & Ors.
","Judgment
A.S. Bopanna, J.
1. The appellant is before this Court in this appeal claiming to be
aggrieved by the order dated 10.11.2022 passed by the National
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (‘NCDRC’
for short) in Consumer Complaint No. 2367 of 2018. By the said
order the NCDRC has concluded that the appellant is bound by
the terms and conditions of the agreement dated 11.01.2006,
while the respondent was bound by various instructions of the
Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’ for short), at the time of signing
the agreement dated 11.01.2006. Hence the complaint filed by
the appellant was dismissed. The appellant is therefore before
this Court.
2. The brief facts are that the appellant was in need of home loan.
The respondents No. 2 and 3 being the employees of respondent
No. 1 approached the appellant during August 2005. The appellant
was exploring the option of securing loan from other financial
institutions as well. The case of the appellant is that respondents
No. 2 and 3 being the direct sales agent and the resident manager
of respondent No. 1 - HDFC convinced the appellant that the rate
of interest charged by the respondent No. 1 on home loan was
lesser than what was being charged by ICICI Bank. In this regard,
the appellant relied on an email dated 05.10.2005 from respondent
No. 2 to contend that a comparison was provided in the said email
to the appellant that the rate of interest offered by respondent No.1
was cheaper.
3. It is contended that the respondent No. 2, on behalf of respondent
No. 1 had assured that the rate of interest would be charged based
on the Prime Lending Rate of RBI. Based on such representations the
appellant is stated to have applied for home loan of Rs.3,50,00,000/-
(Rupees Three Crores and Fifty Lakhs) from respondent No.1, which
was sanctioned and the loan agreement dated 11.01.2006 was
entered into. The loan amount was disbursed to DLF Universal Ltd.,
in instalments between January 2006 to December 2007. As per
the loan agreement, interest at 7.25% p.a and margin of 3.5 % per
annum was provided. Though this was the position, the grievance of
4 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the appellant is that the respondent No. 1 revised the rate of interest
to 8.25 %, despite RBI not having changed the Prime Lending Rate
during 11.01.2006 to 01.05.2006.
4. In spite of the complainant contacting the respondent No. 2 and
other officers, there was no relief, instead, the respondent No. 1
raised the rate of interest to 8.75 %, to 9.25% and again to 10.5%
though there was no change made by RBI with regard to the Prime
Lending Rate. The appellant therefore got issued a legal notice dated
27.09.2007 demanding to return the interest amount which was
charged over and above 7.5% p. a. The respondent No.1 vide their
reply to the notice dated 09.10.2007 contended that the appellant
through the agreement opted for ‘Adjustable Rate of interest’, as such
rate of interest was varying as per the retail prime lending rate of
respondent No. 1. It is in that background the appellant approached
the Consumer Forum.
5. We have heard Sri. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel for the
appellant, Sri. Aniruddha Choudhary for the respondents and perused
the appeal papers.
6. The thrust of the contention is that the respondent No. 2 on behalf of
respondent No.1 had assured that the interest charged by respondent
No.1 is as per the retail prime lending rate to be notified by RBI. As
such the interest which was indicated at 7.25% p.a. can be altered
only if the RBI had altered the rate of interest and not otherwise.
Though, in the agreement it is contained that the rate of interest
would be as per the prime lending rate of interest of respondent
No.1, the same is contrary to the assurance that was held out to the
appellant that such adjustable rate of interest agreed is only when
the rate of interest is varied by the RBI and not as per the interest
to be varied by respondent No.1. The learned senior counsel for
the appellant in that regard has placed strong reliance on the email
dated 05.10.2005, to contend that such assurance was made to
the appellant.
7. The learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on Texco
Marketing (P) Ltd. v. TATA AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
(2023) 1 SCC 428, wherein the issue considered was with regard
to an exclusion clause in an insurance policy which materially
altered the nature of the contract. It was observed in this regard
that insurance contracts are standard form contracts wherein the
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 5
Rajesh Monga v. Housing Development Finance
Corporation Limited & Ors.
insurer being the dominant party dictates its own terms and the
consumer has weak bargaining power and as such the contracts
are one sided. The concept of freedom of contract loses some
significance in a contract of insurance. Such contracts demand a
very high degree of prudence, good faith, disclosure and notice
on the part of the insurer, being different facets of the doctrine of
fairness. The bench consisting of two Hon’ble judges was of the
opinion that one cannot give a restrictive or narrow interpretation
to the provisions relating to unfair trade practices as given under
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Court’s finding against one
of the parties qua the existence of unfair trade practice has to be
transformed into an adequate relief in favour of the other, particularly
in light of Section 14 of the 1986 Act. Once, the State Commission
or the NCDRC, as the case may be, comes to the conclusion
that the term of a contract is unfair, particularly by adopting an
unfair trade practice, the aggrieved party has to be extended the
resultant relief which is further strengthened by Sections 47 and
49 of the 2019 Act. It was also observed that under sub-section
(2) of Sections 49 and 59 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019
the State Commission and the NCDRC, respectively, may declare
any terms of the contract being unfair to any consumer to be null
and void and there exists ample power to declare any terms of the
contract as unfair, if in its opinion, its introduction by the insurer
has certain elements of unfairness.
In Debashis Sinha v. R.N.R. Enterprise (2023) 3 SCC 195,
the dispute was regarding amenities promised by the real estate
developers in their brochures/advertisement which were not delivered
by them. It was noted that once the NCDRC arrived at a finding that
the respondents therein were casual in their approach and had even
resorted to unfair trade practice, it was its obligation to consider the
appellants’ grievance objectively and upon application of mind and
thereafter give its reasoned decision. If at all, the appellants had not
forfeited any right by registration of the sale deeds and if indeed the
respondents were remiss in providing any of the facilities/amenities as
promised in the brochure/advertisement, it was the duty of NCDRC
to set things right.
8. In Pradeep Kumar v. Postmaster General (2022) 6 SCC 351, in
those facts and circumstances it was found by this Court that fraud
was committed by an officer and employee of the post office. It was
6 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
held that the Post Office, as an abstract entity, functions through
its employees. Employees, as individuals, are capable of being
dishonest and committing acts of fraud or wrongs themselves or in
collusion with others. Such acts of bank/post office employees, when
done during their course of employment, are binding on the bank/
post office at the instance of the person who is damnified by the
fraud and wrongful acts of the officers of the bank/post office and
such acts within their course of employment will give a right to the
appellants to legally proceed for injury, as this is their only remedy
against the post office. Thus, the post office, like a bank, can and
is entitled to proceed against the officers for the loss caused due to
the fraud, etc. but this would not absolve them from their liability if
the employee involved was acting in the course of his employment
and duties.
9. From a perusal of the above noted cases, it would disclose that
they are circumstances where certain aspects were contained in
the agreements in question, but a contention was raised contrary to
the same and this Court had rejected such contention. The learned
senior counsel would however contend that though the parties may
have agreed on certain aspects in the agreement, what is important
is the intention of the parties and any correspondence exchanged
between the parties as a prelude to the transaction before executing
the agreement will be relevant to know the intention of the parties. It
is in that regard contended that the email dated 05.10.2005 was prior
to the agreement dated 11.01.2006 and as such the said intention
should be gathered and given effect to. In order to persuade us to
accept this contention, the learned senior counsel for the appellant
has relied on the decision in Board of Trustees of Chennai Port
Trust v. Chennai Container Terminal Private Ltd. (2014) 1
CTC 573 wherein it was contended that the petitioner therein had
granted licence to Respondent No. 1 therein for the development
and maintenance of Chennai Container Terminal in terms of Licence
Agreement entered into between parties in 2001. Contentions were
raised that pre-contractual correspondence cannot be relied upon
as the correspondence fructified into a contract. It was held that
while English jurisprudence is clear on the aspect of pre-contractual
correspondence losing its significance once the contract comes into
existence, a straightjacket formula cannot be applied in India as
there may be people from different states and different languages as
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 7
Rajesh Monga v. Housing Development Finance
Corporation Limited & Ors.
their mother tongue whose wishes culminate into a contract which
is drafted and concluded in a foreign language.
10. Having perused the precedents on which reliance was placed, we
are of the opinion that the same does not come to the aid of the
appellant. In the instant case, at the outset, it is to be noted that
the respondent No.1 being a NBFC and as a corporate body would
be bound by its policies and procedures with regard to lending and
recovery. In that regard, the applicability of the rate of interest to
be charged is also a matter of policy and cannot be case-specific
unless the individual agreement entered into between the parties
indicate otherwise.
11. In that backdrop, a perusal of the fact situation in the instant case will
disclose that the appellant filed the loan application on 16.09.2005.
It was indicated therein that the ‘Rate option’ is ‘Adjustable’, which
discloses that, what was opted is an Adjustable Rate of Interest, which
will depend on the increase or decrease of the rate of interest. The
issue however is as to whether such an Adjustable Rate of Interest
will apply based only on the rate of interest being fixed/ altered by
RBI or as to whether the Rate of Interest fixed/ altered by Respondent
No.1 - HDFC will apply in respect of the loan transaction. It is in that
regard contended that respondent No.2, representing respondent No.
1 - HDFC had made a tabulation comparing the rate of interest to
represent that it is beneficial to the appellant and had explicitly indicated
in the email dated 05.10.2005 that- “PLR is decided by RBI, whereas
FRR is decided by the individual Bank, HDFC is the only Institution
working on PLR”. It also indicated that in other banks like ICICI there
is a clause that the change in FRR is on sole discretion of the bank.
12. The agreement dated 01.11.2006 executed between the parties inter
alia provides as follows;
“1.1 (e). The expression ‘rate of interest’ means the
Rate of interest referred to in Article 2.2 of this Agreement
and as varied from time to time in terms of this Agreement.
(h) The expression ‘Adjustable Interest Rate’ or “AIR”
means the interest rate announced by HDFC from time to
time as its retail prime lending rate and applied by HDFC
with spread, if any, as may be decided by HDFC, on the
loan of the borrower pursuant to this Agreement.
8 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(i) The expression “Retail Prime Lending Rate” or ‘RPLR’
means the interest rate announced by HDFC from time
to time as its retail prime lending rate.
2.2 (a). Until and as varied by HDFC in terms of this
Agreement the AIR applicable to the said loan as at the
date of execution of this agreement is as stated in the
Schedule. is as stated in the Schedule.
3(f). HDFC may vary its retail crime lending rate from time
to time in such manner including as to the loan amounts
as HDFC may deem fit in its own discretion.”
13. At the threshold, it can be noted that the appellant is not an illiterate
person to take the benefit of the precedents relied upon. On the
other hand, when it is contended that the appellant had the option
of securing loan from other banks and that being misled by the email
had entered into the transaction, would by itself indicate that the
appellant was worldly wise. In such circumstance when the parties
have signed the agreement dated 01.11.2006, the terms agreed
therein would bind the parties and the email exchanged between
the parties cannot override the policy decisions of the respondent
No.1 institution. In order to contend that the appellant has been
misled or that the earlier representation will constitute unfair trade
practice, the appellant ought to have raised such contention when
the agreement was to be signed.
14. Having executed the agreement; having agreed to the terms and
conditions; having received the loan amount, the appellant cannot
raise any objection for the first time when the rate of interest was
increased after having acquiesced by signing the agreement. Further,
the appellant having repaid the loan amount with interest as per the
terms of agreement cannot make out a grievance in hindsight and
seek refund of the amount paid.
15. That apart, though it is contended that the appellant had the option
of securing financial assistance from other institutions but was lured
by respondent No.2 through the email and therefore amounts to
unfair trade practice causing loss to the appellant, due to which he is
entitled to be compensated, there is no material on record or evidence
tendered to establish that the appellant had in fact approached any
other financial institution which had agreed to sanction loan or to
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 9
Rajesh Monga v. Housing Development Finance
Corporation Limited & Ors.
demonstrate that it was a better bargain and if taken from such
institution the appellant was in a better position.
16. Therefore, if all these aspects of the matter are kept in perspective
and the order passed by the NCDRC is perused, we are of the
view that no error has been committed so as to call for interference.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
17. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.

and therefore, the appellant (SSPL) was not entitled to claim

proviso to s.3, 1993 Act would be applicable to the agreement

payable:
Held: On a reading of s.3 of the 1993 Act, as it stood before the
enactment of the proviso, the buyer and the supplier could agree
upon the date of payment – In case of absence of stipulation with
regard to the date of payment, the “appointed day” in terms of
s.2(b) of the 1993 Act, would be the date, on which the payment
is due – This is also clear from reading s.4, which states the
date from which interest is payable – As per s.4, the buyer is
liable to pay interest if he fails to pay the amount to the supplier
as required by s.3 – After enactment of the proviso to s.3, the
contractual rights of the parties to agree to the date of payment,
have been restricted in terms of the said proviso – Thus, if the
contractual date of payment exceeds 120 days from the day of

acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance, interest would
be payable for the period beyond 120 days from the day of

case, the supply/purchase order dated 30.03.1995 issued by
MSSIDCL to SSPL, postulated and the parties had agreed that
MSSIDCL would be liable to pay SSPL only after the goods
were delivered and accepted by the consignee-Maharashtra
State Electricity Board (MSEB) and on the payment being
received by MSSIDCL from the MSEB – No reason to interfere
with the conclusion in the impugned judgment passed by the
High Court, setting aside the arbitral award – Further, by way
of Act No.23 of 1998, which came in effect from 10.08.1998,
amending clause 2(f), MSSIDCL is to be treated or deemed to
be a supplier to MSEB – However, this will not deviate from the
fact that MSSIDCL was the buyer under the supply/purchase
order dated 30.03.1995 issued by MSSIDCL to SSPL – Equally,

2. We have heard learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant
– Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Limited1 and the Respondent -
Maharashtra Small Scale Industries Development Corporation Ltd.2
3. During the course of the hearing, our attention was drawn to Sections
3, 4 and 5 of the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale
and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 19933. For the sake of
convenience, the said Sections are reproduced below: -
“3. Liability of buyer to make payment.- Where any supplier
supplies any goods or renders any services to any buyer,
the buyer shall make payment therefor on or before the
date agreed upon between him and the supplier in writing
or, where there is no agreement in this behalf, before the
appointed day:
Provided that in no case the period agreed upon between
the supplier and the buyer in writing shall exceed one
hundred and twenty days from the day of acceptance or
the day of deemed acceptance.
4. Date from which and rate at which interest is payable.-
Where any buyer fails to make payment of the amount to
the supplier, as required under section 3, the buyer shall,
1 For short, “SSPL”.
2 For short, “MSSIDCL”.
3 For short, “1993 Act”.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 457
Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Limited v. Maharashtra Small Scale
Industries Development Corporation Ltd.
notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement
between the buyer and the supplier or in any law for the
time being in force, be liable to pay interest to the supplier
on that amount from the appointed day or, as the case may
be, from the date immediately following the date agreed
upon, at one-and-half time of Prime Lending Rate charged
by the State Bank of India.
Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, “Prime
Lending Rate” means the Prime Lending Rate of the State
Bank of India which is available to the best borrowers of
the bank.
5. Liability of buyer to pay compound interest.-
Notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement
between a supplier and a buyer or in any law for the time
being in force, the buyer shall be liable to pay compound
interest (with monthly interest) at the rate mentioned in
section 4 on the amount due to the supplier.”
4. We would also reproduce the definition clauses (b), (c) and (f) to
Section 2, which are applicable, unless the context otherwise requires.
The same read thus: -
(b) “appointed day” means the day following immediately
after the expiry of the period of thirty days from the day
of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance of any
goods or any services by a buyer from a supplier;
Explanation.-For the purposes of this clause,-
(i) “the day of acceptance” means,-
(a) the day of the actual delivery of goods or the rendering
of services; or
(b) where any objection is made in writing by the buyer
regarding, acceptance of goods or services within
thirty days from the day of the delivery, of goods or
the rendering of services, the day on which such
objection is removed by the supplier;
(ii) “the day of deemed acceptance” means, where no objection
is made in writing by the buyer regarding acceptance of
458 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
goods or services within thirty days from the day of the
delivery of goods or the rendering of services, the day of
the actual delivery of goods or the rendering of services;
(c) “buyer” means whoever buys any goods or receives
any services from a supplier for consideration;
xxx xxx xxx
(f) “supplier” means an ancillary industrial undertaking or
a small scale industrial undertaking holding a permanent
registration certificate issued by the Directorate of Industries
of a State or Union territory and includes,-
(i) the National Small Industries Corporation, being a company,
registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);
(ii) the Small Industries Development Corporation of a State
or a Union territory, by whatever name called, being a
company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1
of 1956).”
5. The proviso to Section 3, and the amendment to Section 2(f) to
include the addition of National Small Industries Corporation and
the Small Industries Development Corporation of a State or a Union
Territory to the definition of “supplier”, were incorporated by Act No.
23 of 1998 with effect from 10.08.1998.
6. On a reading of Section 3 of the 1993 Act, as it stood before the
enactment of the proviso, the buyer and the supplier could agree
upon the date of payment. In case of absence of stipulation with
regard to the date of payment, the “appointed day” in terms of Section
2(b) of the 1993 Act, would be the date, on which the payment is
due. This is also clear from reading Section 4, which states the
date from which interest is payable. As per Section 4, the buyer is
liable to pay interest if he fails to pay the amount to the supplier as
required by Section 3. Non-obstante part of Section 4 only deals
with the stipulation in a contract whereby liability to pay interest is
barred/prohibited. It does not, in any way, override the contractual
clause with regard to the date of payment. In other words, in case the
contract states that interest will not be payable even in the case of
belated payment, then Section 4 of the Act will come into operation,
overriding the negative contractual clause.

from 10.08.1998, is that the supplier and the buyer may agree by
contract on the date of payment, but in no case can the date of
payment exceed 120 days from the day of acceptance or the day of
deemed acceptance. The terms ‘the appointed date’, ‘the acceptance
date’ and ‘the deemed date of acceptance’ have been defined vide
clause (b) to Section 2 of the 1993 Act.
8. After enactment of the proviso to Section 3, the contractual rights
of the parties to agree to the date of payment, have been restricted
in terms of the said proviso. In other words, if the contractual date
of payment exceeds 120 days from the day of acceptance or the
day of deemed acceptance, interest would be payable for the period
beyond 120 days from the day of acceptance or the date of deemed
acceptance.
9. When we turn to the facts of the present case, the supply/purchase
order dated 30.03.1995 issued by MSSIDCL to SSPL, had stated
as under: -
“25. The price of the goods delivered and accepted by
the consignee and when received from the consignee
will be paid to the supplier by the Corporation subject to
deductions of advances, if any, paid by the Corporation
and the service changes [sic] and other moneys payable
to the Corporation by the supplier. No advance payment
will be made for any supply of the goods unless otherwise
agreed by the Corporation.”
10. The contract had, therefore, postulated and the parties had agreed
that MSSIDCL would be liable to pay SSPL only after the goods are
delivered and accepted by the consignee, namely, Maharashtra State
Electricity Board4 and on the payment being received by MSSIDCL
from the MSEB.
11. If the proviso to Section 3 applies, this contractual clause will get
modified in terms of the proviso to Section 3, which has fixed the
upper time limit for payment to 120 days from the day of acceptance
or the day of deemed acceptance. However, the question would
4 For short, “MSEB”.
460 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
arise as to whether the said proviso would be applicable to the
agreement in question, which was entered into between the parties
on 30.03.1995, albeit the proviso was enacted and enforced with
effect from 10.08.1998.
12. Even if, for the sake of argument, it is to be accepted that the proviso
to Section 3 would be applicable in respect of supplies or payments
due or payable after 10.08.1998, the issue with regard to calculation
and computation of interest requires examination and determination of
the day of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance, as interest
would be payable only after a period of 120 days from such date.
13. In these circumstances and in view of the aforesaid position, we do
not find any good ground and reason to interfere with the conclusion
in the impugned judgment passed by the Division Bench of the High
Court, setting aside the arbitral award dated 30.06.2003. We would,
however, record that the award having been set aside, the provisions
of Section 43(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 would
come into operation and would accordingly apply.
14. We clarify that MSEB need not be a party to the proceedings, if
any, which may be initiated by SSPL or MSSIDCL. However, any
adjudication for payment of interest under Sections 3 to 5 of 1993
Act, including the question relating to application of the proviso,
would require ascertainment of the appointed date, the date of
acceptance or the deemed date of acceptance. To this limited
extent, ascertainment of facts with reference to the consignee –
MSEB, to whom the goods were supplied by SSPL, is required. By
way of Act No.23 of 1998, which came in effect from 10.08.1998,
amending clause 2(f), MSSIDCL is to be treated or deemed to be
a supplier to MSEB. However, this will not deviate from the fact
that MSSIDCL was the buyer under the supply/purchase order
dated 30.03.1995 issued by MSSIDCL to SSPL. Equally, the G.O.
2(1)/A/93-SSI Bd. and Policy dated 05.05.1993 issued by the Ministry
of Industry, Department of SSI, Agro and Rural Industries, Office of
the Development Commissioner (Small Scale Industries), has an
effect of treating MSSIDCL as a supplier for the purpose of claiming
interest from the buyer, that is MSEB, with whom they have entered
into a contract for the purpose of the 1993 Act. The liability to pay
and the privity of contract in terms of the supply/purchase order
dated 30.03.1995 is between MSSIDCL and SSPL. The contractual
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 461
Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Limited v. Maharashtra Small Scale
Industries Development Corporation Ltd.
relationship, rights and obligations inter se MSSIDCL and SSPL do
not undergo any change.
15. On the question of liability under Section 5 as well, there is a dispute
as it is accepted that the principal amount has been paid. A question
would arise whether under Section 5, interest as compounded is to be
treated as a principal amount. This aspect has not been considered
in the award passed by the sole arbitrator, which has awarded
compound interest on the interest element with monthly rest at 1.5
times the Prime Lending Rate charged by the State Bank of India.
16. We are informed that certain payments were made by MSSIDCL
and a substantial amount of over Rs.1.30 crores has been paid
to/withdrawn by SSPL. It will be open to MSSIDCL to move an
application under Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
for restitution or execution, as it may be advised. MSSIDCL would
be entitled to enforce the security in case SSPL does not pay or
refund the said amount.
17. The appeal is dismissed in the above terms. However, there shall
be no order as to costs.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

v.
The Branch Manager, Future Generali India Life Insurance
Company Limited & Another
(Civil Appeal No. 3821 of 2024)
10 April 2024
[B.V. Nagarathna* and Augustine George Masih, JJ.]","The present civil appeal has been filed by the complainant, who
is the daughter of the insured-deceased, who is also the nominee
under the subject life insurance policies of her late father. The
controversy in the present case pertains to the factum of repudiation
of the insurance claim of the complainant on the ground of the
material suppression of information regarding the previous policies
allegedly held by the insured-deceased, while taking the life
insurance policy from the respondent insurance company. Whether,
the respondent insurance company herein was correct in repudiating
the claim of the appellant on the ground of suppression of material
information pertaining to the existing policies with other insurers.
","Insurance Act, 1938 – s.45, before the 2014 amendment
– Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof – Onus of proof –
Repudiation of insurance claim of the complainant on the
ground of the material suppression of information regarding
the previous policies – Consumer complaint filed – The
District Commission allowed the complaint on the ground
that no documentary evidence was available to show that
deceased-insured had taken various insurance policies from
other companies – The State Commission upheld the order of
the District Commission – However, the NCDRC observed that
the respondent insurance company had given details of the
aforesaid policies by way of affidavit and the same was not
denied by the complainant in her affidavit – Therefore, NCDRC
concluded that deceased insured had withheld information
in respect of several insurance policies which he had taken
from other insurers – Correctness:
* Author
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 725
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
Held: As per the language and interpretation of Section 45, the
insurer cannot question the policy after the expiry of the time
period and if it does, then the burden rests on the insurer to
establish materiality of the fact suppressed and the knowledge
of the insured about such suppression, so that the repudiation
of the claim could be justified by the insurer – In the present
case, the onus was on the insurer to show that the insured had
fraudulently given false information and the said information was
related to a material fact – The respondent insurance company
has produced no documentary evidence whatsoever before
the District Forum to prove its allegation that the insured had
taken multiple insurance policies from different companies and
had suppressed the same – Before the State Commission, the
respondent had provided a tabulation of the 15 different policies
taken by the insured-deceased – However, the said tabulation
was not supported by any other documentary evidence, like
the policy documents of these other policies, or pleadings in
courts, or such other corroborative evidence – The NCDRC had
accepted the averment of the respondents, without demanding
corroborative documentary evidence in support of the said fact
– The approach adopted by the NCDRC was not correct – The
cardinal principle of burden of proof in the law of evidence
is that “he who asserts must prove”, which means that if the
respondents herein had asserted that the insured had already
taken fifteen more policies, then it was incumbent on them
to prove this fact by leading necessary evidence – The onus
cannot be shifted on the appellant to deal with issues that have
merely been alleged by the respondents, without producing any
evidence to support that allegation – The respondents have
merely provided a tabulation of information about the other
policies held by the insured-deceased – The table produced is
incomplete and contradictory as far as the date of birth of the
insured is concerned – Therefore, the NCDRC could not have
relied upon the said tabulation and put the onus on the appellant
to deal with that issue in her complaint and thereby considered
the said averment as proved or proceeded to prove the stance
of the opposite party – The repudiation of the policy was without
any basis or justification – Thus, the impugned order passed by
the NCDRC set aside. [Paras 16,17, 48, 49, 50]
Principle/Doctrine – uberrimae fidei – Insurance – Reciprocal
duties:
726 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Held: Just as the insured has a duty to disclose all material
facts, the insurer must also inform the insured about the terms
and conditions of the policy that is going to be issued to him and
must strictly conform to the statements in the proposal form or
prospectus, or those made through his agents – Thus, the principle
of utmost good faith imposes meaningful reciprocal duties owed
by the insured to the insurer and vice versa. [Para 22]
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection
of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002 – A fact, whether
material or not – Propositions:
Held: Whether a fact is material will depend on the circumstances,
as proved by evidence, of the particular case – It is for the court
to rule as a matter of law, whether, a particular fact is capable of
being material and to give directions as to the test to be applied
– Rules of universal application are not therefore to be expected,
but the propositions as set out are well established: (a) Any fact
is material which leads to the inference, in the circumstances
of the particular case, that the subject matter of insurance is
not an ordinary risk, but is exceptionally liable to be affected by
the peril insured against – This is referred to as the “physical
hazard”; (b) Any fact is material which leads to the inference
that the particular proposer is a person, or one of a class of
persons, whose proposal for insurance ought to be subjected
at all or accepted at a normal rate – This is usually referred to
as the “moral hazard”; (c) The materiality of a particular fact is
determined by the circumstances of each case and is a question
of fact. [Para 26]
Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof and onus of proof –
Consumer Fora:
Held: Though the proceedings before the Consumer Fora are
in the nature of a summary proceeding – Yet the elementary
principles of burden of proof and onus of proof would apply –
Section 101 of the Evidence Act states that whoever desires any
Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent
on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those
facts exist – When a person is bound to prove the existence of
any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person
– Section 102 of the Evidence Act provides a test regarding on
whom the burden of proof would lie, namely, that the burden lies
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 727
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
on the person who would fail if no evidence were given on either
side – There are however exceptions to the general rule as to
the burden of proof as enunciated in Sections 101 and 102 of the
Evidence Act, 1872, i.e., in the context of the burden of adducing
evidence: (i) when a rebuttable presumption of law exists in favour
of a party, the onus is on the other side to rebut it; (ii) when any
fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden
of proving it is on him (Section 106) – In some cases, the burden
of proof is cast by statute on particular parties (Sections 103 and
105). [Paras 41, 42]
Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof and onus of proof –
Distinction between:
Held: There is an essential distinction between burden of proof
and onus of proof; burden of proof lies upon a person who
has to prove the fact and which never shifts but onus of proof
shifts – Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the
evaluation of evidence – For instance, in a suit for possession
based on the title, once the plaintiff has been able to create a high
degree of probability so as to shift the onus on the defendant,
it is for the defendant to discharge his onus and in the absence
thereof, the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to
have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiff’s
title. [Para 43]
Evidence – Burden of proof – Insurance contracts – Non-
disclosure of a material fact:
Held: In the context of insurance contracts, the burden is on the
insurer to prove the allegation of non-disclosure of a material fact
and that the non-disclosure was fraudulent – Thus, the burden of
proving the fact, which excludes the liability of the insurer to pay
compensation, lies on the insurer alone and no one else. [Para 45]
Word and Phrases – Contra proferentem rule:
Held: In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures (P)
Ltd., (2016) 3 SCC 49, the Supreme Court quoted Halsbury’s
Laws of England (5th Edn. Vol. 60, Para 105) on the contra
proferentem rule – Where there is ambiguity in the policy the
court will apply the contra proferentem rule – Where a policy is
produced by the insurers, it is their business to see that precision
and clarity are attained and, if they fail to do so, the ambiguity
728 [2024] 4 S.C.R.

will be resolved by adopting the construction favourable to the
insured. [Para 40]

","Judgment
B.V. Nagarathna, J.
1. The present civil appeal has been filed by the complainant, who is
the daughter of the insured-deceased Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu,
who is also the nominee under the subject life insurance policies of
her late father. The appellant is assailing the order dated 22.07.2019
passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “NCDRC”) in Revision Petition
No.1268 of 2019.
2. By the impugned order, the NCDRC has allowed the revision petition
filed by the respondent-opposite party, thereby setting aside the orders
passed by the District Consumer Forum and the State Consumer
Forum and sustaining the repudiation of the complainant’s claim by
the opposite party insurer-company.
3. The brief facts giving rise to the present appeal are as follows:
3.1. For the sake of convenience, the parties shall be referred to
as complainant and opposite party.
3.2. Late Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu, father of the complainant,
obtained two insurance policies from the opposite party – one
on 05.05.2009, for a sum of Rs. 4,50,000/-, and the other on
22.03.2010, for a sum of Rs. 4,80,000/-. Under the said two
policies, in the event of death by accident, twice the sum assured
was payable by the insurer. In the application form of the policy,
730 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the insured had been asked about the details of his existing life
insurance policies with any other insurer, and the insured had
answered the same in the negative. The complainant, being the
daughter of the policy holder Late Sri Siriveri Venkateswarlu,
was nominated to receive the proceeds under both the policies.
3.3. On 28.02.2011, the policy holder unfortunately lost his life in
a train accident, leaving behind the complainant alone as his
legal heir as well as nominee for death benefits. Immediately
thereafter, the complainant approached the opposite party
and informed about the death of her father and they advised
the complainant to submit a claim form along with necessary
documents which she did. However, by letter dated 31.12.2011,
the complainant’s claims were repudiated by the opposite party.
3.4. The claim of the complainant was repudiated on the ground that
the policy holder had suppressed material facts in his application
form with respect to existing life insurance policies from other
insurers. Upon investigation by the opposite party, it was found
that the insured had substantial life insurance cover with other
insurance companies, even prior to the date of his application.
After an evaluation of all facts and documents submitted and
circumstances of the case, the opposite party came to the
conclusion that the replies to the questions in the application
form were incorrect, in as much as the opposite party held
documentary proof in support of the same. They observed that
had such information been disclosed, their underwriting decision
would have materially changed. It was further remarked that
the contract of insurance is based on the principle of utmost
good faith and the company relies on the information provided
by the life insured in the application for insurance. Thus, the
claim was held to be not valid and the liability to pay under the
policy was repudiated by the insurer.
3.5. Being aggrieved by the repudiation of the claim, the complainant
approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer
complaint, bearing CC No.8 of 2014. The District Commission at
Vijaywada, Krishna District, by order dated 27.08.2014, allowed
the consumer complaint, on the ground that no documentary
evidence was available to show that the deceased-insured had
taken various insurance policies from various other companies.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 731
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
The Commission found deficiency of services on the part of the
opposite party in repudiating the claim filed by the complainant
and therefore directed the opposite parties to pay the insurance
amount of Rs.7,50,000/- + Rs.9,60,000/- under two policies
jointly and severally with interest at the rate of 6% per annum
from 31.12.2011, i.e., the date of repudiation of the claim of the
complainant, till realisation, along with costs of Rs. 2000/- to
the complainant.
3.6. Being aggrieved, the insured/opposite party filed an appeal
bearing FA No.94 of 2015 before the concerned State Consumer
Forum at Vijaywada. The State Commission observed that there
was absolutely no material produced by the opposite party
before the Forum to prove the allegation of suppression. The
documents attempted to be produced were neither original nor
certified nor authenticated. However, even assuming that there
were existing policies, still the non-disclosure of pre-existing
policies does not amount to suppression of material facts.
Reliance for the same was placed on some previous judgments
of the NCDRC. Hence, the claim could not have been said
to be vitiated by fraud. The opposite parties were not right in
repudiating the claim. The State Commission therefore, by its
order dated 11.12.2018, dismissed the appeal of the opposite
party and upheld the order of the District Commission.
3.7. The opposite party thereafter approached the NCDRC through
Revision Petition No.1268 of 2019, challenging the order passed
by the State Commission in FA No.94 of 2015. The NCDRC,
vide impugned judgment, agreed with the opposite party that
the deceased-insured had withheld the information in respect
of several insurance policies which he had taken from other
insurers. The NCDRC observed that on the one hand, the
opposite party had duly stated the details of the other policies
in their affidavit, but on the other, the complainant, even in her
affidavit filed by way of evidence, did not claim that the policies
mentioned in the written version of the opposite party had not
been taken by the deceased. Reliance was further placed by
the NCDRC on the judgment of this Court in Reliance Life
Insurance Co Ltd vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod, (2019)
6 SCC 175, (“Rekhaben”) wherein the repudiation of the claim
732 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
due to suppression of the fact of other existing insurance policies
was upheld by the Supreme Court. The NCDRC held that the
Supreme Court’s judgment would prevail over the judgments of
the NCDRC relied upon by the State Consumer forum and thus,
the revision petition was allowed and the consumer complaint
was dismissed.
4. Hence, the complainant has preferred the present Special Leave
Petition against the impugned judgment of the NCDRC.
5. We have heard learned counsel for the Appellant, Sri Venkateswara
Rao Anumolu and learned counsel for the Respondent, Sri Praveen
Mahajan for the insurer. The controversy in the present case pertains
to the factum of repudiation of the insurance claim of the Complainant
on the ground of the material suppression of information regarding
the previous policies allegedly held by the insured-deceased, while
taking the life insurance policy from the Opposite Party.
6. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the insurance
company has not proved that appellant’s father had any other
insurance policy while taking the insurance policy from the opposite
party. Thus, there has been no material suppression of fact in the
application form with respect to holding any previous policy by the
insured-deceased or his family members.
7. It was further submitted by the appellant that the NCDRC was
incorrect in upholding the repudiation of claim in the absence of an
iota of documentary evidence on record to support the contention
that the insured-deceased had suppressed any fact under Clause
6 of the Proposal Form about the previous policies issued by other
insurers. The respondent has merely alleged the fact of multiple
insurance policies of the insured-deceased through their affidavit of
evidence but had not discharged their burden of proof by leading
any documentary evidence to support their allegation.
8. Per Contra, learned counsel for the respondent has supported
the judgment of the NCDRC and has further contended that the
insured-deceased had taken fifteen other insurance policies worth
Rs.71,27,702/- prior to the issuance of the subject policies by them.
These policies were not disclosed in the proposal forms and had the
respondent been aware about these other insurance policies with
other insurance companies and the existing risk cover at the time
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 733
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
of assessment of risk under the subject policies, they would have
certainly not issued the subject policies to the insured-deceased.
Thus, the insured-deceased has suppressed the material fact and
the claim has been rightly repudiated on this ground alone.
9. Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the policy
of life insurance is based upon the principle of “uberrimae fidei”, i.e.,
utmost good faith. When a specific fact is asked for in the proposal
form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and
full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within the
best of his knowledge. In the present case as well, the insured-
deceased was under the obligation to make complete and honest
disclosure of all the facts and materials at the time of filling of the
proposal form. The failure to do so shows the mala fide intention
on the part of the insured-deceased and renders the policy invalid,
void ab-initio, inoperative and unenforceable.
10. Learned counsel for the respondent also relied upon the judgment
of this court in the case of Rekhaben, which is contended to be
similar in facts to the present case and where this Court allowed
the repudiation of the insurance claim on the ground of material
suppression of information about the previously taken insurance
policies.
11. Having heard the learned counsel for the respective parties, the point
that arises for consideration before this Court in the present Civil
Appeal, is, whether, the respondent herein was correct in repudiating
the claim of the appellant on the ground of suppression of material
information pertaining to the existing policies with other insurers.
12. In order to answer the aforesaid question, it would be useful to
recapitulate the relevant provisions of the law of insurance and
evidence, vis-à-vis burden of proof and the method of discharging
that burden of proof to prove an alleged fact, which is suppression
of a material fact while seeking an insurance policy from an insurer.
13. The repudiation of an insurance claim is largely governed by Section
45 of the Insurance Act, 1938. Section 45 is a special provision of
law, which bars the calling in question of an insurance policy beyond
expiry of the stipulated period, except in a few circumstances that
have to be proved by the insurer. The relevant part of the said
provision, as it stood at the material time, is reproduced as under:
734 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“45. Policy not be called in question on ground of mis-
statement after two years.- No policy of life insurance
effected before the commencement of this Act shall after
the expiry of two years from the date of commencement
of this Act and no policy of life insurance effected after
the coming into force of this Act shall after the expiry
of two years from the date on which it was effected, be
called in question by an insurer on the ground that a
statement made in the proposal for insurance or in any
report of a medical officer, or referee, or friend of the
insured, or in any other document leading to the issue
of the policy, was inaccurate or false, unless the insurer
shows that such statement was on a material matter or
suppressed facts which it was material to disclose and
that it was fraudulently made by the policy-holder and
that the policy-holder knew at the time of making it that
the statement was false or that it suppressed facts which
it was material to disclose:
Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent the
insurer from calling for proof of age at any time if he is
entitled to do so, and no policy shall be deemed to be
called in question merely because the terms of the policy
are adjusted on subsequent proof that the age of the life
insured was incorrectly stated in the proposal.”
14. A three-judge bench of this court in Mithoolal Nayak vs. Life
Insurance Corporation of India, AIR 1962 SC 814, explained the
scope of the operating part of Section 45 as under:
“7….It would be noticed that the operating part of S. 45
states in effect (so far as is relevant for our purpose) that
no policy of life insurance effected after the coming into
force of the Act shall, after the expiry of two years from
the date on which it was effected, be called in question
by an insurer on the ground that a statement made in
the proposal for insurance or in any report of a medical
officer, or referee, or friend of the insured, or in any other
document leading to the issue of the policy, was inaccurate
or false; the second part of the section is in the nature of
a proviso which creates an exception. It says in effect that
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 735
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
if the insurer shows that such statement was on a material
matter or suppressed facts which it was material to disclose
and that it was fraudulently made by the policyholder and
that the policy-holder knew at the time of making it that
the statement was false or that it suppressed facts which
it was material to disclose, then the insurer can call in
question the policy effected as a result of such inaccurate
or false statement.”
15. The scope of Section 45 was dealt with by this Court in the case of
Rekhaben as follows:
“14. Section 45 stipulates restrictions upon the insurer
calling into question a policy of life insurance after the
expiry of two years from the date on which it was effected.
After two years have elapsed the insurer cannot call it into
question on the ground that: (i) a statement made in the
proposal; or (ii) a statement made in any report of a medical
officer, referee or friend of the insured; or (iii) a statement
made in any other document leading to the issuance of the
policy was inaccurate or false, unless certain conditions are
fulfilled. Those conditions are that: (a) such a statement
was on a material matter; or (b) the statement suppressed
facts which were material to disclose and that (i) they were
fraudulently made by the policy holder; and (ii) the policy-
holder knew at the time of making it that the statements
were false or suppressed facts which were material to
disclose. The cumulative effect of Section 45 is to restrict
the right of the insurer to repudiate a policy of life insurance
after a period of two years of the date on which the policy
was effected. Beyond two years, the burden lies on the
insurer to establish the inaccuracy or falsity of a statement
on a material matter or the suppression of material facts.
Moreover, in addition to this requirement, the insurer has
to establish that this non-disclosure or, as the case may
be, the submission of inaccurate or false information was
fraudulently made and that the policy-holder while making
it knew of the falsity of the statement or of the suppression
of facts which were material to disclose.”

16. Since the present case deals with a policy and its repudiation before
the 2014 amendment to Section 45 of the Insurance Act, the pre-
amendment time period of two years would be applicable to the
case. As per the aforesaid language and interpretation of Section
45, the insurer cannot question the policy after the expiry of the
time period and if it does, then the burden rests on the insurer to
establish materiality of the fact suppressed and the knowledge of
the insured about such suppression, so that the repudiation of the
claim could be justified by the insurer.
17. In the present case, the onus was on the insurer to show that
the insured had fraudulently given false information and the said
information was related to a material fact. The second aspect of the
controversy would be dealt with first.
18. For a better appreciation of the controversy, it would be important
to analyse the maxim of uberrimae fidei that governs the insurance
contracts. It may also be observed that insurance contracts are
special contracts based on the general principles of full disclosure
inasmuch as a person seeking insurance is bound to disclose all
material facts relating to the risk involved. Law demands a higher
standard of good faith in matters of insurance contracts which is
expressed in the legal maxim uberrimae fidei. The plea of utmost good
faith has also been taken by the respondent, for contending that the
insured-deceased had a duty to disclose the details of the previous
policies, as the same was sought in the application form. However,
the insured failed in his duty to correctly answer the question about
his previous policies. The law relating to the maxim uberrimae fidei
was dealt with by this Court in the case of Manmohan Nanda vs.
United India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2022) 4 SCC 582, (“Manmohan
Nanda”). The same could be discussed at this stage with reference
to legal authorities as well as relevant provisions of law.
19. MacGillivray on Insurance Law, (12th Edn., Sweet & Maxwell,
London, 2012 at p. 477) has summarised the duty of an insured to
disclose as under:
“... the assured must disclose to the insurer all facts material
to an insurer’s appraisal of the risk which are known or
deemed to be known by the assured but neither known nor
deemed to be known by the insurer. Breach of this duty
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 737
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
by the assured entitles the insurer to avoid the contract of
insurance so long as he can show that the non-disclosure
induced the making of the contract on the relevant terms.”
20. Lord Mansfield in Carter vs. Boehm, (1766) 3 Burr 1905 has
summarised the principles necessitating disclosure by the assured
in the following words:
“Insurance is a contract of speculation.
The special facts upon which the contingent chance is to
be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the
assured only; the under-writer trusts to his representation,
and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back
any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the under-
writer into a belief that the circumstance does not exist …
The keeping back such circumstance is a fraud, and
therefore the policy is void. Although the suppression
should happen through mistake, without any fraudulent
intention; yet still the under-writer is deceived and the
policy is void; because the risk run is really different from
the risk understood and intended to be run, at the time
of the agreement.
The policy would be equally void against the under-writer
if he concealed; ...
Good faith forbids either party, by concealing what he
privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from
his ignorance of the fact, and his believing the contrary.”
The aforesaid principles would apply having regard to the nature of
policy under consideration, as what is necessary to be disclosed are
“material facts” which phrase is not definable as such, as the same
would depend upon the nature and extent of coverage of risk under a
particular type of policy. In simple terms, it could be understood that
any fact which has a bearing on the very foundation of the contract
of insurance and the risk to be covered under the policy would be
a “material fact”.
21. Under the provisions of Insurance Regulatory and Development
Authority (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002
the explanation to Section 2 (d) defining “proposal form” throws
738 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
light on what is the meaning and content of “material.” For an easy
reference the definition of “proposal form” along with the explanation
under the aforesaid Regulations has been extracted as under:
“2. Definitions. In these regulations, unless the context
otherwise requires-
x x x
(d) “Proposal Form” means a form to be filled in by
the proposer for insurance, for furnishing all material
information required by the insurer in respect of a risk, in
order to enable the insurer to decide whether to accept
or decline, to undertake the risk, and in the event of
acceptance of the risk, to determine the rates, terms and
conditions of a cover to be granted.
Explanation: “Material” for the purpose of these regulations
shall mean and include all important, essential and relevant
information in the context of underwriting the risk to be
covered by the insurer.”
Thus, the Regulation also defines the word “material” to
mean and include all “important”, “essential” and “relevant”
information in the context of guiding the insurer in deciding
whether to undertake the risk or not.”
22. Just as the insured has a duty to disclose all material facts, the
insurer must also inform the insured about the terms and conditions
of the policy that is going to be issued to him and must strictly
conform to the statements in the proposal form or prospectus, or
those made through his agents. Thus, the principle of utmost good
faith imposes meaningful reciprocal duties owed by the insured to
the insurer and vice versa. This inherent duty of disclosure was a
common law duty of good faith originally founded in equity but has
later been statutorily recognised as noted above. It is also open to
the parties entering into a contract to extend the duty or restrict it
by the terms of the contract.
23. The duty of the insured to observe utmost good faith is enforced by
requiring him to respond to a proposal form which is so framed to seek
all relevant information to be incorporated in the policy and to make it
the basis of a contract. The contractual duty so imposed is that any
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 739
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
suppression or falsity in the statements in the proposal form would
result in a breach of duty of good faith and would render the policy
voidable and consequently repudiate it at the instance of the insurer.
24. In relation to the duty of disclosure on the insured, any fact which
would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer and not a particular
insurer is a material fact. The test is, whether, the circumstances
in question would influence the prudent insurer and not whether it
might influence him vide Reynolds vs. Phoenix Assurance Co. Ltd.,
(1978) 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 440. Hence, the test is to be of a prudent
insurer while issuing a policy of insurance.
25. The basic test hinges on whether the mind of a prudent insurer
would be affected, either in deciding whether to take the risk at all
or in fixing the premium, by knowledge of a particular fact if it had
been disclosed. Therefore, the fact must be one affecting the risk. If
it has no bearing on the risk it need not be disclosed and if it would
do no more than cause insurers to make inquiries delaying issue
of the insurance, it is not material if the result of the inquiries would
have no effect on a prudent insurer.
26. Whether a fact is material will depend on the circumstances, as
proved by evidence, of the particular case. It is for the court to rule
as a matter of law, whether, a particular fact is capable of being
material and to give directions as to the test to be applied. Rules
of universal application are not therefore to be expected, but the
propositions set out in the following paragraphs are well established:
(a) Any fact is material which leads to the inference, in
the circumstances of the particular case, that the
subject matter of insurance is not an ordinary risk,
but is exceptionally liable to be affected by the peril
insured against. This is referred to as the “physical
hazard”.
(b) Any fact is material which leads to the inference that
the particular proposer is a person, or one of a class
of persons, whose proposal for insurance ought to be
subjected at all or accepted at a normal rate. This is
usually referred to as the “moral hazard”.
(c) The materiality of a particular fact is determined by the
circumstances of each case and is a question of fact.
740 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
27. If a fact, although material, is one which the proposer did not and
could not in the particular circumstances have been expected to know,
or if its materiality would not have been apparent to a reasonable
man, his failure to disclose it is not a breach of his duty.
28. Full disclosure must be made of all relevant facts and matters that
have occurred up to the time at which there is a concluded contract.
It follows from this principle that the materiality of a particular fact
is determined by the circumstances existing at the time when it
ought to have been disclosed, and not by the events which may
subsequently transpire. The duty to make full disclosure continues to
apply throughout negotiations for the contract but it comes to an end
when the contract is concluded; therefore, material facts which come
to the proposer’s knowledge subsequently need not be disclosed.
29. Thus, a proposer is under a duty to disclose to the insurer all material
facts as are within his knowledge. The proposer is presumed to know
all the facts and circumstances concerning the proposed insurance.
Whilst the proposer can only disclose what is known to him, the
proposer’s duty of disclosure is not confined to his actual knowledge,
it also extends to those material facts which, in the ordinary course
of business, he ought to know. However, the assured is not under a
duty to disclose facts which he did not know and which he could not
reasonably be expected to know at the material time. The second
aspect of the duty of good faith arises in relation to representations
made during the course of negotiations, and for this purpose all
statements in relation to material facts made by the proposer during
the course of negotiations for the contract constitute representations
and must be made in good faith.
30. The basic rules to be observed in making a proposal for insurance
may be summarized as follows:
(a) A fair and reasonable construction must be put upon
the language of the question which is asked, and the
answer given will be similarly construed. This involves
close attention to the language used in either case,
as the question may be so framed that an unqualified
answer amounts to an assertion by the proposer that
he has knowledge of the facts and that the knowledge
is being imparted. However, provided these canons
are observed, accuracy in all matters of substance
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 741
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
will suffice and misstatements or omissions in trifling
and insubstantial respects will be ignored.
(b) Carelessness is no excuse, unless the error is so
obvious that no one could be regarded as misled. If
the proposer puts ‘no’ when he means ‘yes’ it will not
avail him to say it was a slip of the pen; the answer
is plainly the reverse of the truth.
(c) An answer which is literally accurate, so far as it
extends, will not suffice if it is misleading by reason
of what is not stated. It may be quite accurate for the
proposer to state that he has made a claim previously
on an insurance company, but the answer is untrue
if in fact he has made more than one.
(d) Where the space for an answer is left blank, leaving
the question un-answered, the reasonable inference
may be that there is nothing to enter as an answer. If
in fact there is something to enter as an answer, the
insurers are misled in that their reasonable inference
is belied. It will then be a matter of construction
whether this is a mere non-disclosure, the proposer
having made no positive statement at all, or whether
in substance he is to be regarded as having asserted
that there is in fact nothing to state.
(e) Where an answer is unsatisfactory, as being on the
face of it incomplete or inconsistent the insurers may,
as reasonable men, be regarded as put on inquiry,
so that if they issue a policy without any further
enquiry they are assumed to have waived any further
information. However, having regard to the inference
mentioned in head (4) above, the mere leaving of a
blank space will not normally be regarded as sufficient
to put the insurers on inquiry.
(f) A proposer may find it convenient to bracket together
two or more questions and give a composite answer.
There is no objection to his doing so, provided the
insurers are given adequate and accurate information
on all points covered by the questions.
742 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(g) Any answer given, however accurate and honest at
the time it was written down, must be corrected if, up
to the time of acceptance of the proposal, any event
or circumstance supervenes to make it inaccurate
or misleading.
[Source : Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourth Edition,
Para 375, Vol.25 : Insurance]
31. Sometimes the standard of duty of disclosure imposed on the insured
could make the insured vulnerable as the statements in the proposal
form could be held against the insured. Conversely, certain clauses
in the policy of insurance could be interpreted in light of the contra
proferentem rule as against the insurer. In order to seek specific
information from the insured, the proposal form must have specific
questions so as to obtain clarity as to the underlying risks in the
policy, which are greater than the normal risks.
32. From the aforementioned discussion, it is clear that the principle of
utmost good faith puts reciprocal duties of disclosure on both parties
to the contract of insurance. These reciprocal duties mandate that
both the parties make complete disclosure to each other, so that the
parties can take an informed decision and a fair contract of insurance
exists between them. No material facts should be suppressed, which
may have a bearing on the risk being insured and the decision of
the party to undertake that risk. However, not every question can
be said to be material fact and the materiality of a fact has to be
adjudged as per the rules stated in the aforementioned judgment.
33. Whether the information with regard to previous policies from other
insurers is a material fact or not has already been dealt with by
this Court in the judgment of Rekhaben. The facts of the said case
were that the insured therein had taken a policy of life insurance
from Max New York Life Insurance Co. Ltd. on 10.07.2009 for a sum
of Rs. 11 lakhs. Barely two months thereafter, on 16.09.2009, the
insured submitted a proposal for a life insurance term plan policy
of Reliance Life Insurance Co Ltd for an insurance cover of Rs. 10
lakhs. One of the questions that the proposer was required to answer
in the proposal form was whether he was currently insured or had
previously applied for life insurance cover, critical illness cover or
accident benefit cover. This query was answered in the negative.
In substance, the information regarding life insurance policy earlier
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 743
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
taken had to be mentioned. The query was answered as “NA” or “not
applicable” response. The appellant company therein issued a policy
of life insurance to the spouse of the respondent on 22.09.2009. The
respondent spouse died on 08.02.2010. A claim for payment of Rs.10
lakhs was submitted. On coming to know that the spouse of the
respondent therein had been insured with another private insurance
company for a sum of Rs.11 lakhs and that the claim had been settled,
the appellant company repudiated the claim stating that there was
suppression of material fact inasmuch as there was glaring omission
in the mentioning of details of the life insurance policy held by the
life assured with other company. Being aggrieved by the repudiation,
the respondent in the said case filed a consumer complaint which
was dismissed on the ground that there was non-disclosure of the
fact that the insured had held a previous policy in the proposal form
filled up by the proposer. The appeal filed by the respondent was,
however, allowed based on a decision of the NCDRC in Sahara
India Life Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Rayani Ramanjaneyulu, 2014
SCC OnLine NCDRC 525 : (2014) 3 CPJ 582 (“Sahara India”). The
decision of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission was
affirmed by NCDRC for the reason that the omission of the insured
to disclose a previous policy of insurance would not influence the
mind of a prudent insurer, as held in Sahara India.
34. The question before this Court in the aforesaid case was, whether,
the repudiation could be sustained on the grounds of suppression of
information about other insurance policies. It is pertinent to note that
the insured therein had admitted the non-disclosure of the earlier cover
for life insurance held by him, but argued that the non-disclosure of
such information was not a material fact whose suppression would
allow for repudiation of the claim under Section 45. Therefore, the
Court ruled in favour of the insurance company and held that such
suppression was indeed a material suppression of information, as it
had a bearing on the decision of the insurer to enter into the contract
of insurance or not. The court thereunder held as follows:
“32. In the present case, the insurer had sought information
with respect to previous insurance policies obtained by
the assured. The duty of full disclosure required that no
information of substance or of interest to the insurer be
omitted or concealed. Whether or not the insurer would
have issued a life insurance cover despite the earlier cover
744 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of insurance is a decision which was required to be taken
by the insurer after duly considering all relevant facts and
circumstances. The disclosure of the earlier cover was
material to an assessment of the risk which was being
undertaken by the insurer. Prior to undertaking the risk, this
information could potentially allow the insurer to question
as to why the insured had in such a short span of time
obtained two different life insurance policies. Such a fact
is sufficient to put the insurer to enquiry.
33. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the insurer
submitted that where a warranty has been furnished by the
proposer in terms of a declaration in the proposal form,
the requirement of the information being material should
not be insisted upon and the insurer would be at liberty
to avoid its liability irrespective of whether the information
which is sought is material or otherwise. For the purposes
of the present case, it is sufficient for this Court to hold in
the present facts that the information which was sought
by the insurer was indeed material to its decision as to
whether or not to undertake a risk. The proposer was
aware of the fact, while making a declaration, that if any
statements were untrue or inaccurate or if any matter
material to the proposal was not disclosed, the insurer may
cancel the contract and forfeit the premium. MacGillivray
on Insurance Law formulates the principle thus:
“…In more recent cases it has been held that
all-important element in such a declaration is
the phrase which makes the declaration the
“basis of contract”. These words alone show
that the proposer is warranting the truth of his
statements, so that in the event of a breach this
warranty, the insurer can repudiate the liability on
the policy irrespective of issues of materiality.”
34. We are not impressed with the submission that the
proposer was unaware of the contents of the form that he
was required to fill up or that in assigning such a response
to a third party, he was absolved of the consequence of
appending his signatures to the proposal. The proposer
duly appended his signature to the proposal form and
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 745
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
the grant of the insurance cover was on the basis of the
statements contained in the proposal form. Barely two
months before the contract of insurance was entered
into with the appellant, the insured had obtained another
insurance cover for his life in the sum of Rs 11 lakhs. We
are of the view that the failure of the insured to disclose
the policy of insurance obtained earlier in the proposal form
entitled the insurer to repudiate the claim under the policy.”
35. However, the aforesaid judgment is distinguishable from the present
case, insofar as there is no admission by the appellant herein of
any previous policies taken by the insured. In that case, after the
admission by the policy holder, the Court was tasked only with the
question of whether the fact about previous polices qualified to
be a “material fact” that was suppressed. However, in the present
case, in light of Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, the burden
rests on the insurer to prove before the Court that the insured had
suppressed the information about the previous policies. This burden
of proof has to be duly discharged by the insurer in accordance with
the law of evidence.
36. In the instant case, NCDRC has extracted from the letter dated
31.12.2011, by which the claim of the appellant was repudiated,
and has relied upon the reply filed by respondent company before
the District Forum wherein details of as many as fifteen insurance
policies taken from various insurers, other than the policy taken from
the respondent company, have been given as under:

37. A mere perusal of the aforesaid table would indicate that the date of
birth declared are different and the date of issuance has not been
stated except in respect of one policy. It is also not known from the
table to whom the said policies were issued. However, the NCDRC
has observed that the appellant-complainant had not alleged in
her complaint that no other insurance policy had been taken by
the deceased. In the affidavit of the complainant, the fact that
insurance policies were taken from other insurers was not denied.
The respondent insurance company had given details of the aforesaid
policies by way of an affidavit. Therefore, NCDRC concluded that
deceased insured had withheld information in respect of several
insurance policies which he had taken from other insurers.
38. Placing reliance on Rekhaben, the NCDRC observed that Sahara
India had been overruled in Rekhaben and therefore consumer
complaint was dismissed. We find that the approach of the NCDRC
is erroneous for the following reasons:
i) Firstly, the NCDRC has failed to note that the details of the
policies extracted in the table above do not state as in whose
name the said policies were issued. On perusal of the dates of
birth declared in the policies, it is not clear as to whose dates
of birth are stated therein.
ii) Secondly, the dates of issuance of policies have not been
mentioned. More significantly, by merely mentioning the details
as above stated would not establish the case of the insurance
company. There was no corroboration of the said fact either by
producing copies of the aforesaid policies or by examining the
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 747
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
officers of the various insurance companies which had issued
the policies so as to establish the fact that the said policies had
indeed been issued to the insured in order to prove material
suppression of the fact of other policies obtained by the insurer
in the proposal form. In the absence of any corroboration of
the aforesaid details by letting in proper evidence, the mere
mentioning of the half baked details in the affidavit would not
amount to proof of the said fact. The NCDRC has thus failed
to take note of the fact that the aforesaid details have not been
supported by other corroborative evidence. The mere mentioning
of certain details in an affidavit of evidence is not proof of the
facts unless that is supported either by other documentary and/
or oral evidence.
iii) Further, the NCDRC was also not right in finding fault with the
complainant not mentioning in her affidavit the evidence that
the insured had taken policies from other insurance companies
and that the details given in the version of the respondent
company were not true.
39. Next, we also find that the declaration form asked the following queries
which were accordingly answered in the negative. The queries are
extracted as under:
“6.1 Details of applications submitted to & existing life
insurance policies with future Generali and with any insurer.
(In case of housewife, major student or minor life to be
Assured please give details of husbands and parents
insurance also)
6.2 Whether any proposal for life cover or critical illness
Rider or Accident and Disability Benefit Rider, application
for revival of any Policy has been made to any life insurer,
declined/postponed/dropped/accepted or revived at
modified rates”
On a reading of Query 6.1, what was sought was details of applications
submitted to and existing life insurance policies with Future Generali
(respondent company) and with any (other) insurer. Further details
sought were in case of housewife, major student or minor life to be
assured and to give details of husband’s and parents’ insurance also.
It is not clear as to whether Query 6.1 referred to details of insurance
748 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
policy of the proposer with Future Generali and with any other insurer,
as what was also sought was details of wife, major student or a minor
life to be assured and to give details of the husband’s and parents’
insurance. Therefore, it is not clear from reading of Query 6.1 as
to whether details of insurance policy of the insured with Future
Generali and with other insurer were sought or the query related to
the details of husband and parents’ insurance policy being disclosed
in case the insured was a housewife, major student or a minor life
when the insured was a housewife or a minor child. The insured in
the instant case did not belong to either the two categories. Query
6.2 was, whether any proposal for life cover or critical illness rider
or accident and disability benefit rider, application for revival of
any policy had been made to any life insurer, declined/postponed/
dropped/accepted or revived at modified rates. The answer to the
said queries were given by the insured in the negative.
Considering Query 6.2, firstly, it is noted that the deceased proposer
had stated in the negative with regard to making of any application
for revival of any policy. There is no evidence whatsoever let in by
the respondent insurance company that there was an application
made for revival of any policy of the insured which had either been
declined/postponed/dropped/accepted or revived at modified rates.
Therefore, the answer in the negative given to Query 6.2 cannot
be held as against the appellant herein. In the circumstances, the
NCDRC could not have concluded that when the answer “NO” was
written to Query 6.2, there was any suppression of material fact.
40. Insofar as the Query 6.1 is concerned, it is noted that the same is not
clear and it is not known in what context the details of the insured
were sought with regard to any existing life insurance policy. On a
reading of Query 6.1 holistically, it is also not clear regarding the
nature of information that was sought by the respondent insurance
company as discussed above. The answer given by the insured to
the Query 6.1 was thus in the negative. In this backdrop, can it be
said that there was a suppression of material fact by the insured in
the proposal form. In this context, it is necessary to place reliance
on the contra proferentem rule. This Court in the case of Manmohan
Nanda, discussed the rule of contra proferentem as under:
“45. The contra proferentem rule has an ancient genesis.
When words are to be construed, resulting in two alternative
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 749
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
interpretations then, the interpretation which is against the
person using or drafting the words or expressions which
have given rise to the difficulty in construction, applies.
This rule is often invoked while interpreting standard form
contracts. Such contracts heavily comprise of forms with
printed terms which are invariably used for the same kind
of contracts. Also, such contracts are harshly worded
against individuals and not read and understood most often,
resulting in grave legal implications. When such standard
form contracts ordinarily contain exception clauses, they
are invariably construed contra proferentem rule against
the person who has drafted the same.
46. Some of the judgments which have considered the
contra proferentem rule are referred to as under:
46.1. In General Assurance Society Ltd. v. Chandumull
Jain, AIR 1966 SC 1644, it was held that where there is
an ambiguity in the contract of insurance or doubt, it has
to be construed contra proferentem against the insurance
company.
46.2. In DDA v. Durga Chand Kaushish, AIR 1973 SC
2609, it was observed:
“In construing document one must have regard,
not to the presumed intention of the parties, but
to the meaning of the words they have used. If
two interpretations of the document are possible,
the one which would give effect and meaning
to all its parts should be adopted and for the
purpose, the words creating uncertainty in the
document can be ignored.”
46.3. Further, in Central Bank of India Ltd. v. Hartford Fire
Insurance Co. Ltd., AIR 1965 SC 1288, it was held:
“11. … what is called the contra proferentem
rule should be applied and as the policy was
in a standard form contract prepared by the
insurer alone, it should be interpreted in a way
that would be favourable to the assured.”
750 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
46.4. In Sahebzada Mohammad Kamgarh Shah v. Jagdish
Chandra Deo Dhabal Deb, AIR 1960 SC 953, it was
observed that where there is an ambiguity it is the duty of
the court to look at all the parts of the document to ascertain
what was really intended by the parties. But even here the
rule has to be borne in mind that the document being the
grantor’s document it has to be interpreted strictly against
him and in favour of the grantee.
46.5. In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures
(P) Ltd., (2016) 3 SCC 49 , this Court quoted Halsbury’s
Laws of England (5th Edn. Vol. 60, Para 105) on the contra
proferentem rule as under:
“37. … Contra proferentem rule.—Where there
is ambiguity in the policy the court will apply
the contra proferentem rule. Where a policy is
produced by the insurers, it is their business to
see that precision and clarity are attained and, if
they fail to do so, the ambiguity will be resolved
by adopting the construction favourable to
the insured. Similarly, as regards language
which emanates from the insured, such as the
language used in answer to questions in the
proposal or in a slip, a construction favourable
to the insurers will prevail if the insured has
created any ambiguity. This rule, however,
only becomes operative where the words
are truly ambiguous; it is a rule for resolving
ambiguity and it cannot be invoked with a
view to creating a doubt. Therefore, where
the words used are free from ambiguity in the
sense that, fairly and reasonably construed,
they admit of only one meaning, the rule has
no application.”
46.6. The learned counsel for the appellant have relied upon
Sushilaben Indravadan Gandhi v. New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., (2021) 7 SCC 151, wherein it was observed that any
exemption of liability clause in an insurance contract must
be construed, in case of ambiguity, contra proferentem
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 751
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
against the insurer. In the said case reliance was placed
on Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. (India) Ltd. v. Garg
Sons International, (2014) 1 SCC 686, wherein this Court
held as under :
“39. … 11. The insured cannot claim anything
more than what is covered by the insurance
policy. “The terms of the contract have to be
construed strictly, without altering the nature
of the contract as the same may affect the
interests of the parties adversely.” The clauses
of an insurance policy have to be read as they
are. Consequently, the terms of the insurance
policy, that fix the responsibility of the Insurance
Company must also be read strictly. The
contract must be read as a whole and every
attempt should be made to harmonise the
terms thereof, keeping in mind that the rule
of contra proferentem does not apply in case
of commercial contract, for the reason that a
clause in a commercial contract is bilateral and
has mutually been agreed upon.”
Having regard to the aforesaid discussion on contra proferentem rule,
it is noted that the Queries 6.1 and 6.2 are not clear in themselves
as we have discussed the same above. Therefore, the answer given
by the deceased cannot be taken in a manner so as to negate the
benefit of the policy by repudiation of the same on the demise of
the insured.
41. At this stage, we may also dilate on the aspect of burden of proof.
Though the proceedings before the Consumer Fora are in the nature
of a summary proceeding. Yet the elementary principles of burden of
proof and onus of proof would apply. This is relevant for the reason
that no corroborative evidence to what has been deposed in the
affidavit is let in by the insurance company in order to establish a
valid repudiation of the claim in the instant case. Section 101 of the
Evidence Act, 1872 states that whoever desires any Court to give
judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence
of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. When
a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that
the burden of proof lies on that person. This Section clearly states
752 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the burden of proving a fact rests on the party who substantially
asserts the affirmative of the issue and not upon the party who denies
it; for a negative is usually incapable of proof. Simply put, it is easier
to prove an affirmative than a negative. In other words, the burden
of proving a fact always lies upon the person who asserts the same.
Until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to
be called upon to prove his case. The court has to examine as to
whether the person upon whom burden lies has been able to discharge
his burden. Further, things which are admitted need not be proved.
Whether the burden of proof has been discharged by a party to the
lis or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the
case. The party on whom the burden lies has to stand on his own
and he cannot take advantage of the weakness or omissions of the
opposite party. Thus, the burden of proving a claim or defence is
on the party who asserts it.
42. Section 102 of the Evidence Act, 1872 provides a test regarding on
whom the burden of proof would lie, namely, that the burden lies
on the person who would fail if no evidence were given on either
side. Whenever the law places a burden of proof upon a party,
a presumption operates against it. Hence, burden of proof and
presumptions have to be considered together. There are however
exceptions to the general rule as to the burden of proof as enunciated
in Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act, 1872, i.e., in the context
of the burden of adducing evidence: (i) when a rebuttable presumption
of law exists in favour of a party, the onus is on the other side to
rebut it; (ii) when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any
person, the burden of proving it is on him (Section 106). In some
cases, the burden of proof is cast by statute on particular parties
(Sections 103 and 105).
43. There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and
onus of proof; burden of proof lies upon a person who has to
prove the fact and which never shifts but onus of proof shifts.
Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation
of evidence. For instance, in a suit for possession based on the
title, once the plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of
probability so as to shift the onus on the defendant, it is for the
defendant to discharge his onus and in the absence thereof, the
burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been
discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiff’s title vide RVE
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 753
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
Venkatachala Gounder vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and VP
Temple, (2003) 8 SCC 752.
44. In a claim against the insurance company for compensation, where
the appellants in the said case had discharged the initial burden
regarding destruction, damage of the showroom and the stocks
therein by fire and riot in support of the claim under the insurance
policy, it was for the insurance company to disprove such claim with
evidence, if any, vide Shobika Attire vs. New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., (2006) 8 SCC 35.
45. Section 103 of the Evidence Act, 1872 states that the burden of proof
as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to
believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof
of that fact shall lie on any particular person. This Section enlarges
the scope of the general rule in Section 101 that the burden of proof
lies on the person who asserts the affirmative of the issue. Further,
Section 104 of the said Act states that the burden of proving any
fact necessary to be proved in order to enable any person to give
evidence of any other fact is on the person who wishes to give such
evidence. The import of this Section is that the person who is legally
entitled to give evidence has the burden to render such evidence. In
other words, it is incumbent on each party to discharge the burden of
proof, which rests upon him. In the context of insurance contracts, the
burden is on the insurer to prove the allegation of non-disclosure of
a material fact and that the non-disclosure was fraudulent. Thus, the
burden of proving the fact, which excludes the liability of the insurer
to pay compensation, lies on the insurer alone and no one else.
46. Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 states that when any fact is
especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving
that fact is upon him. This Section applies only to parties to the suit
or proceeding. It cannot apply when the fact is such as to be capable
of being known also by persons other than the parties. (Source:
Sarkar, Law of Evidence, 20th Edition, Volume-2, LexisNexis)
47. In light of the aforesaid discussion on burden of proof, it has to
be analysed if the respondent in the present case has adequately
discharged his burden of proof about the fact of suppression of
previous life insurance policies of the insured.
48. The respondent insurance company has produced no documentary
evidence whatsoever before the District Forum to prove its allegation
754 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the insured had taken multiple insurance policies from different
companies and had suppressed the same. The District Forum had
therefore concluded that there was no documentary evidence to
show that the deceased-life insured had taken various insurance
policies except an averment and on that basis the repudiation was
held to be wrong. Before the State Commission, the respondent
had provided a tabulation of the 15 different policies taken by the
insured-deceased, amounting to Rs.71,27,702/-. The same has been
extracted above. However, the said tabulation was not supported by
any other documentary evidence, like the policy documents of these
other policies, or pleadings in courts, or such other corroborative
evidence. The respondent sought to mark a bunch of documents
before the State Commission, which related to the policy papers of
the insured with another insurer, i.e., Kotak Life Insurance. However,
the respondent was not granted permission by the State Commission,
as the said documents were neither original, nor certified, nor
authenticated. Apart from this, there was no effort made by the
respondent to bring any authenticated material on record. Thus, in
the absence of any evidence to prove that the insured-deceased
possessed some insurance policies from other insurance companies,
the State Commission upheld the decision of the District Forum in
setting aside the repudiation of the claim by the respondent.
49. Before the NCDRC, the respondent again provided the aforesaid
tabulation of policies of the insured-deceased. The respondents in
their affidavit stated that the insured-deceased had taken multiple
insurance policies before taking the policy from them. The NCDRC
however accepted the averment of the respondents, without
demanding corroborative documentary evidence in support of the
said fact. The NCDRC, on the contrary, also held that the fact about
multiple policies was not dealt with by the appellant in her complaint
or evidence affidavit and this therefore proved that the insured had
indeed taken the policies from multiple companies as claimed by
the respondents.
50. The aforesaid approach adopted by the NCDRC is, in our view,
not correct. The cardinal principle of burden of proof in the law of
evidence is that “he who asserts must prove”, which means that if
the respondents herein had asserted that the insured had already
taken fifteen more policies, then it was incumbent on them to prove
this fact by leading necessary evidence. The onus cannot be shifted
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 755
Mahakali Sujatha v. The Branch Manager, Future Generali
India Life Insurance Company Limited & another
on the appellant to deal with issues that have merely been alleged
by the respondents, without producing any evidence to support that
allegation. The respondents have merely provided a tabulation of
information about the other policies held by the insured-deceased.
The said tabulation also has missing information with respect to policy
numbers and issuing dates and bears different dates of births. Further,
this information hasn’t been supported with any other documents to
prove the averment in accordance with law. No officer of any other
insurance company was examined to corroborate the table of policies
said to have been taken by the deceased policy holder, father of the
appellant herein. Moreover, the table produced is incomplete and
contradictory as far as the date of birth of the insured is concerned.
Therefore, in our view, the NCDRC could not have relied upon the
said tabulation and put the onus on the appellant to deal with that
issue in her complaint and thereby considered the said averment
as proved or proceeded to prove the stance of the opposite party.
A fact has to be duly proved as per the Evidence Act, 1872 and the
burden to prove a fact rests upon the person asserting such a fact.
Without adequate evidence to prove the fact of previous policies, it
was incorrect to expect the appellant to deal with the said fact herself
in the complaint or the evidence affidavit, since as per the appellant,
there did not exist any previous policy and thus, the onus couldn’t
have been put on the appellant to prove what was non-existent
according to the appellant.
51. The respondents, vide their counter affidavit before this court, have
sought to produce some documents to substantiate their claim of
other existing insurance policies of the insured-deceased, but the
same cannot be permitted to be exhibited at this stage, that too,
in an appeal filed by the complainant who is the beneficiary under
the policies in question. Any documentary evidence sought to be
relied upon by the respondent ought to have been led before the
District Forum but the same was not done. It was before the District
Forum that the evidence was led and examined and at that stage,
the respondent did not take adequate steps to lead any oral or
documentary evidence to prove their assertion. Their attempt to annex
documents in support of their claim before the State Commission was
also declined due to the presentation of unauthenticated documents.
Therefore, it can be safely concluded that the respondents have
failed to adequately prove the fact that the insured-deceased had
756 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
fraudulently suppressed the information about the existing policies
with other insurance companies while entering into the insurance
contracts with the respondents herein in the present case. Therefore,
the repudiation of the policy was without any basis or justification.
52. Moreover, we have also held on the facts of this case having regard
to the nature of queries in Query Nos.6.1 and 6.2, there was no
suppression of any material fact as per our earlier discussion based
on the contra proferentem rule.
53. In light of the above discussion, the impugned order dated 22.07.2019
passed by the NCDRC in Revision Petition No.1268 of 2019 is set
aside. The respondent company is directed to make the payment
of the insurance claim under both the policies to the appellant,
amounting to Rs. 7,50,000/- and Rs. 9,60,000/-, with interest at the
rate of 7% per annum from the date of filing the complaint, till the
actual realisation.
54. The appeal stands allowed in the aforesaid terms.
55. Parties to bear their respective costs.

The State of Gujarat
(Criminal Appeal No. 2038 of 2017)
09 July 2024
[B.R. Gavai and Sandeep Mehta,* JJ.]","The instant appeal is directed against the judgment dated
13.02.2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court,
whereby, the Division Bench partly accepted the appeal preferred
by the appellant accused-A1 and altered his conviction as recorded
by the trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 302 of
the Penal Code, 1860 to one under Section 304 Part I IPC.
","Penal Code, 1860 – Custodial torture – Death of victim –
Acquittal of accused – Prosecution case that the two police
officers i.e. A1 and A2, assaulted J in the confines of the
Amraiwadi police station at separate intervals causing multiple
injuries all over his body due to which he later died – Trial
Court proceeded to convict both the accused and sentenced
them to imprisonment for life – A1 and A2 appealed before
the High Court – During the pendency of appeal, A-2 expired –
High Court affirmed the decision of the trial Court, however,
the offence was toned down from Section 302 IPC to offence
under Section 304 Part I IPC – Correctness:
Held: J had come along with his advocate and his two sisters
namely, PW-1 and PW-2 and surrendered at the Amraiwadi police
station – Next evening J was produced before the jurisdictional
Magistrate, who remanded him to judicial custody whereafter, he
was taken to and lodged at the Sabarmati Central jail – J’s condition
deteriorated in the prison, later he died – It is further revealed from
the records that deceased-J had been taken and presented before
the DCP at the Karanj Bhavan, Ahmedabad and only thereafter,
he was produced in the concerned Court of the Magistrate – The
Medical Jurist (PW-9) stated that the person having received the
injuries noted in the post-mortem report (Exhibit-50) would not be
* Author
366 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
able to climb a stair case without support and that the expression
of the person and his movement would be painful – Thus, there
was hardly any possibility that after having received the injuries
mentioned in the postmortem report (Exhibit-50), deceased-J could
have climbed up the stairs of Karanj Bhavan, Ahmedabad for being
presented before DCP – Furthermore, on being presented before the
Magistrate, the expression of pain on the face of the victim, would
be prominently visible and could not have escaped being noticed by
the Magistrate – Medical Jurist (PW-9) opined in his examination in
chief that the injuries caused to the deceased were fresh and must
have occurred within six to eight hours of the death – Thus, there
is formidable evidence of the Medical Jurist (PW-9) which totally
discredits the version of the eyewitnesses (PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3)
that deceased-J was inflicted the injuries leading to his death while
being in police custody at the Amraiwadi Police Station – Their
evidence is contradicted in material particulars by the medical
evidence and other attending circumstances – Considering the
unimpeachable and strong opinion of the Medical Jurist (PW-9),
the probability of the victim having been assaulted in Sabarmati
Central jail leading to the fatal injuries noted in the postmortem
report (Exhibit-50) is much higher as compared to the theory set up
in the complaint and the evidence of the star prosecution witness
that deceased-J was fatally assaulted by A1 and A2 while he was
detained at the Amraiwadi Police Station – The prosecution has
failed to bring home the guilt of both the accused persons (A1)
(since deceased) and (A2)(since deceased) by leading cogent,
convincing and reliable evidence and their conviction as recorded
by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court is not sustainable
in the eyes of law – Resultantly, both accused A-1 and A-2 are
acquitted of the charges. [Paras 41, 42, 43, 46, 50, 52]
Evidence – Testimony of witness – Unnatural conduct:
Held: In the instant case, two sisters (PW-1 and PW-2) claimed
to have personally witnessed the assault being made on J
(deceased) – They admitted in their cross-examination that
they had been arraigned as accused in a couple of prohibition
cases – Thus, it can safely be inferred that these two so-called
eyewitnesses were having sufficient contact with the legal system
and were well aware of the legal machinery and would be knowing
the importance of filing a complaint promptly – However, they did
not approach the higher officials or the concerned Court to make
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 367
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
a complaint of the alleged assault made on their victim brother in
the Amraiwadi Police Station by the police officials – They also
did not approach the advocate engaged by them to tell him about
the custodial torture – This pertinent omission in failing to inform
their advocate about the custodial torture allegedly meted out to
J gives rise to a strong assumption about the unnatural conduct
of these eyewitnesses, casting a doubt on the truthfulness of their
version and discredits their testimony. [Paras 29, 30]
Evidence Act, 1872 – Marking of exhibit – Proof of document:
Held: Mere marking of exhibit upon the letter without the expert
deposing about the opinion given therein would not dispense with
the proof of contents of the document as per the mandate of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872. [Para 36]
Evidence – Contradiction between the opinion of Medical jurist
and ocular testimony:
Held: This Court is conscious of the proposition that where there
are contradictions inter se between the opinion of the Medical
Jurist and the ocular testimony, generally, the evidence of the
eyewitnesses should be given precedence – However, where
the contradiction is so prominent that it completely demolishes
the version of the eyewitnesses who are interested and partisan,
in such cases, the Court should be circumspect in admitting the
evidence of the eyewitness while ignoring the convincing opinion
of the Medical Expert. [Para 44]

1. The instant appeal is directed against the judgment dated 13th
February, 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of
Gujarat in Criminal Appeal No. 210 of 1997, whereby, the Division
Bench partly accepted the appeal preferred by the accused appellant
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas and altered his conviction as recorded by
the trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860(hereinafter being referred to as ‘IPC’) to
one under Section 304 Part I IPC and sentenced him to undergo
eight years rigorous imprisonment and further directed that he shall
pay a compensation of Rs. 50,000/- to the heirs of the deceased.

2. Learned Additional City Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad(hereinafter
being referred to as the ‘trial Court’) tried the accused appellant Vinod
Jaswantray Vyas(Original accused No.1)(hereinafter being referred
to as ‘A1’) and his co-accused Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(Original
accused No.2)(hereinafter being referred to as ‘A2’) for the offences
punishable under Section 302 read with Section 114 IPC and vide
judgment dated 4th March, 1997, the learned trial Court proceeded
to convict both the accused for the above offences and sentenced
them to imprisonment for life and fine of Rs. 25,000/- each, in default,
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years.
3. A1 and A2 preferred separate appeals before the Gujarat High Court
being Criminal Appeal Nos. 210 of 1997 and 226 of 1997 respectively,
to challenge the judgment dated 4th March, 1997 passed by the learned
trial Court. A2 expired during the pendency of the appeal before the
High Court. However, being a Government servant, the question of
his conviction had a direct bearing on his death-cum-retiral benefits
and thus, his legal heirs applied for and were granted permission to
prosecute the appeal further. Both appeals were decided by a learned
Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court vide common judgment
dated 13th February, 2017 and the learned Division Bench proceeded
to affirm the findings of the learned trial Court holding that A1 and A2
had subjected Jeeva(deceased) to physical violence in police custody
and thereby, the findings of guilt were affirmed. However, the offence
was toned down from Section 302 IPC to offence under Section 304
Part I IPC and the sentence was modified as above.
4. Only A1 approached this Court to challenge the impugned judgments
whereas, the legal heirs of the co-accused, A2 have not challenged his
conviction. Leave was granted by this Court on 27th November, 2017.
5. During the pendency of the appeal, the sentence awarded to the
accused appellant(A1) was suspended vide order dated 6th June, 2017
and he was directed to be released on bail. However, A1 also passed
away during pendency of the instant appeal and accordingly, by an
order dated 12th August, 2022 his legal heirs were taken on record and
were allowed to continue the appeal by virtue of provisions contained
in Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973(hereinafter
being referred to as ‘CrPC’), so as to seek service benefits of the
original appellant Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(since deceased) in the
event of the acceptance of the appeal.
370 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Brief facts: -
6. The accused appellant(A1) was posted as a Police Inspector at
Amraiwadi Police Station, Ahmedabad. One Jeeva had appeared
and surrendered at the said police station in the late hours of the
night on 10th June, 1992 as he had been arraigned as an accused
in C.R. No. 555 of 1992 registered at the said police station for the
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 307, 323,
324 and 427 IPC. He was also accompanied by the co-accused
Anna Dorai.
7. Jeeva had come to surrender at the police station along with his
advocate Shri Patanwadia and his two sisters namely, Selvin
Prabhakar(PW-1) and Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2). The advocate
Shri Patanwadia left after production of Jeeva at the police station,
however, the two sisters remained behind.
8. The original accused No.2(A2) was the Superintendent of Police at
the relevant point of time who came to the police station sometime
later. It is the case of prosecution that the two police officers i.e.
A1 and A2, assaulted Jeeva with fists and sticks in the confines
of the police station at separate intervals causing multiple injuries
all over his body due to which he became unconscious. He was
then dragged and placed in the lockup room of the police station.
Next evening i.e. on 11th June, 1992, Jeeva was produced before
the jurisdictional Magistrate, who remanded him to judicial custody
whereafter, he was taken to and lodged at the Sabarmati Central
jail. Jeeva’s condition deteriorated in the prison and thus, he was
rushed to the civil hospital in the early hours of 12th June, 1992,
where the doctors declared him dead.
9. Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1), the sister of Jeeva(deceased), forwarded
a telegram(Exhibit-14) to the DGP office, Ahmedabad regarding the
custodial torture leading to her brother Jeeva’s death. However,
no action was forthcoming upon this telegraphic complaint,
whereupon she lodged a complaint(Exhibit-13) in the Court of
the Magistrate concerned on 1st July, 1992. In the interregnum, a
magisterial enquiry(inquest) had been undertaken. The dead body
of Jeeva(deceased) was subjected to postmortem at the BJ Medical
College, Ahmedabad by Dr. Nayan Kumar-Medical Jurist(PW-9). As
per the postmortem report(Exhibit-50), following external injuries
were observed on the body of Jeeva: -
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 371
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat

2) Abrasion on the posterior aspect of middle one-third of
the right arm 1 x 1 cm in size red in colour.
3) Two abrasions on the right shoulder each admeasuring
17 x 1 cm in size and red in colour.
4) Two bruises on the right scapular region each 6 x 4 cm
in size on the back.
5) Seven bruises on the back each varying in size but
about 2 x 4 cms to 4 x 1 cm.
6) Abrasion on the left wrist 1 x 1 cm.
7) Abrasion on the middle third of left forearm posterior
aspect about 2 x 1 cm.
8) Abrasion on the left shoulder 1 x 1 cm.
9) Abrasion on the left side of ligome 1 x 1 cm.
10) Bruise on the left lateral aspect of abdomen on mid-
axillary line at 10th rib 6 x 4 cm in size.

Digital Supreme Court Reports
the interior aspect of right lobe 3 x 4 cm in size. There as
rupture of spleen under external injury No.10. Rupture of
4 x 6 in size at diaphragmatic surface.”
10. The complaint(Exhibit-13) submitted by Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1)
was initially registered as Inquiry Case No. 84 of 1992. The learned
Magistrate directed an inquiry under Sections 200 and 202 CrPC.
Cognizance was taken for the offence punishable under Section
302 IPC and the complaint came to be registered as Criminal
Case No. 1920 of 1993. Since the offence alleged was exclusively
sessions triable, the case was committed to the Court of Additional
City Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad, where the same was registered
as Sessions Case No. 378 of 1993. Charges were framed by the
trial Court against both the accused for the offence punishable
under Section 302 read with Section 114 IPC. The accused abjured
their guilt and claimed trial. The prosecution examined a total of 10
witnesses and exhibited 62 documents in order to prove its case.
In their statements under Section 313 CrPC, the accused denied
the allegations appearing against them in the prosecution case and
claimed to have been falsely implicated.
11. The learned trial Court, after hearing the arguments advanced by
the learned Additional Public Prosecutor and the learned defence
counsel and upon appreciating the evidence available on record
proceeded to convict A1 and A2 and sentenced them both as above
vide judgment dated 4th March, 1997. The Division Bench of the
Gujarat High Court in appeal, while affirming the guilt of both the
accused, toned down the offence from Section 302 IPC to offence
under Section 304 Part I IPC vide judgment dated 13th February,
2017 which is assailed in the present appeal by special leave.
Submissions on behalf of the appellant: -
12. Shri Harin P. Raval, learned senior counsel representing the accused
appellant(A1), put forth the following submissions in order to assail
the impugned judgments seeking acquittal for the accused appellant-
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(since deceased):-
(i) That there is a delay of around 20 days in filing the formal
complaint before the concerned Court of the Magistrate, since
the alleged incident took place on 10th June, 1992 and the
complaint came to be filed on 1st July, 1992.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 373
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
(ii) That the accused appellant had neither any motive nor any
reason to assault Jeeva(deceased).
(iii) That Jeeva(deceased) and Anna Dorai(both accused in C.R.
No. 555/92) had voluntarily surrendered at the Amraiwadi
Police Station. However, the injuries were suffered only by
Jeeva(deceased) which creates a doubt about the prosecution
story, inasmuch as, it cannot be believed that the police officers
who were presumably intending to extract confessions from the
accused would focus their attention only on one accused while
totally sparing the other who was also arraigned in the same case.
(iv) That Jeeva(deceased) was presented in the concerned Court
on 11th June, 1992, but he made no complaint whatsoever to
the Magistrate that he had been maltreated or assaulted by the
police officials at the police station. Jeeva(deceased) was having
significant criminal antecedents and had been arraigned as an
accused in multiple cases and had also been placed under
preventive detention. Therefore, he was fully aware about the
nitty gritties of the legal system. Thus, the rank silence on part
of the victim and his failure in raising a grievance before the
remand Magistrate that he had been subjected to custodial torture
at the police station despite having ample opportunity, creates a
grave doubt on the truthfulness of the entire prosecution case.
(v) That Jeeva(deceased) had been taken and presented before
the DCP Shri Surelia at the Karanj Bhavan, Ahmedabad and
only thereafter, he was produced in the concerned Court of the
Magistrate. Shri Raval referred to the testimony of Pratapbhai
Jagannath(PW-6) to contend that the office of DCP Shri Surelia
was located on the fifth floor and Jeeva(deceased) climbed the
staircases without any support or displaying signs of discomfort
or pain. He fervently contended that it is impossible to believe
that after having received such grave debilitating injuries as
described in the postmortem report, Jeeva(deceased) would
have been in a physical or mental condition to ascend and
descend five flights of stairs and that too without exhibiting any
sign of discomfort.
(vi) Shri Raval urged that Jeeva(deceased) had been sent to the
Sabarmati Central jail on 11th June, 1992 at around 6:30 pm
after being remanded to judicial custody. As per Shri Raval, the
374 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
probability of Jeeva(deceased) having been assaulted by co-
prisoners in the prison cannot be ruled out and is rather more
probabilized considering the fact that the injuries noticed on the
body of the victim were fresh in nature as per Dr. Nayan Kumar-
Medical Jurist(PW-9). To emphasize the above contention,
Shri Raval referred to the testimony(Exhibit-49) of the Medical
Jurist(PW-9) who categorically stated that the injuries caused
to Jeeva(deceased) were fresh and would have been suffered
within six hours of the death.
(vii) Shri Raval referred to the testimony of Udesingh Himmatsingh
Chauhan(PW-8) who stated that he had seen the red dust
over the clothes of dead body. He also claimed to have seen
Sabarmati Central jail from inside and stated that the soil of
the jail was red in colour. Based on the deposition of PW-8,
Shri Raval contended that when the inquest(Exhibit-45) was
carried out, the dead body of Jeeva was found smeared with
red soil which is typical to the Sabarmati Central jail. He thus
urged that there is imminent probability that Jeeva(deceased)
must have suffered the fatal injuries while being confined at
the Sabarmati Central jail.
(viii) That the so-called eyewitnesses(Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1),
Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2) and Nyakar Vasudev(PW-3))
emphatically stated that Jeeva(deceased) was beaten on same
parts of the body both by the accused appellant(A1) and co-
accused(A2). Shri Raval urged that it is impossible to believe
that two accused who assaulted the deceased at different
intervals would selectively target the same parts of the body
to land the blows.
(ix) That the accused appellant(A1) was a seasoned police officer
and hence, it does not stand to reason that he would use sticks
to assault the victim so as to leave behind visible marks and
risk the chance of the injuries being detected. He submitted that
clearly Jeeva(deceased) had been assaulted at the Sabarmati
Central jail and a totally false case has been foisted by the family
members of Jeeva(deceased) to wreak vengeance against the
accused persons on account of the fact that Jeeva(deceased)
was a known bootlegger and had been arraigned in number
of criminal cases by the police officials.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 375
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
On these counts, learned senior counsel implored the Court to accept
the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and acquit the accused
appellant of the charges.
Submissions on behalf of the respondent-State: -
13. Per contra, Ms. Deepanwita Priyanka, learned Standing Counsel
for the State of Gujarat, vehemently and fervently opposed the
submissions advanced by the learned senior counsel for the
appellant. She contended that the trial Court and the High Court,
after thorough appreciation of evidence have recorded concurrent
findings of facts holding the accused appellant(A1) and the co-
accused(A2) responsible for indulging in custodial violence thereby
causing death of Jeeva.
14. She contended that the witnesses, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1),
Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2) had no reason so as to falsely
implicate the accused appellant(A1) for the murder of their brother
Jeeva(deceased). Presence of these witnesses at the Amraiwadi
Police Station was not disputed by the accused persons. The
evidence of these witnesses is reliable and trustworthy. The witness
Nyakar Vasudev(PW-3) was admittedly detained in the lockup of the
police station with Jeeva(deceased) and he too has given clinching
evidence supporting the case of prosecution and hence, this Court
should not feel persuaded to interfere with the concurrent finding of
facts recorded in the impugned judgments.
15. She further urged that Jeeva(deceased) was apprehensive that he
may be subjected to further cruelty at the hands of the police officials
if he made a complaint about the violence meted out to him in police
custody. Thus, rather than speaking out before the learned Magistrate,
he confided about the violence to his sister, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1),
who sent a prompt telegram(Exhibit-14) setting out the details of the
incident to the DGP office, Ahmedabad promptly after the news of
death of her brother Jeeva was conveyed to her and thus, there is
no delay in lodging of the complaint.
16. She further contended that the influence of the accused persons
upon the investigation agency is clearly visible inasmuch as no
action was taken on the telegram(Exhibit-14) promptly sent by Selvin
Prabhakar(PW-1) who was later compelled to lodge a complaint
before the concerned Magistrate, only whereafter, the criminal case
could be registered against the accused.
376 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
17. She thus urged that the testimony of the witnesses examined by
the prosecution was rightly relied upon by the trial Court and the
High Court and that the impugned judgments do not warrant any
interference by this Court.
18. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions
advanced at bar and have minutely reappreciated the evidence
available on record. We have also perused the judgments rendered
by the High Court as well as the trial Court.
Discussion of material/evidence available on record: -
19. The following facts are undisputed as per the record: -
(i) That A1 was posted as Police Inspector, Amraiwadi Police
Station and A2 was posted as Superintendent of Police on
the date of the incident.
(ii) That Jeeva(deceased) and Anna Dorai were arraigned as
accused in C.R. No. 555 of 1992, registered at the Amraiwadi
Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 143,
147, 148, 149, 307, 323, 324 and 427 IPC.
(iii) That on 10th June, 1992 at 10:45 pm, Jeeva(deceased)
accompanied by his two sisters, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) and
Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2) and advocate Shri Patanwadia
had gone to the Amraiwadi Police Station for surrendering in
connection with the above case. Anna Dorai also surrendered
along with Jeeva as he too was arraigned as an accused in
the same case.
(iv) That advocate Shri Patanwadia was not examined in evidence
in support of the prosecution case.
(v) That Anna Dorai who surrendered at the police station along
with Jeeva(deceased) in the same case, did not suffer any
injuries during the period of detention at the police station.
Anna Dorai was surprisingly not examined as a witness by
the prosecution.
(vi) That Meena, wife of Jeeva(deceased), who went to meet him in
the morning of 11th June, 1992 was not examined in evidence.
(vii) Jeeva(deceased) had sufficient exposure to the legal system and
procedure as he had previously also been arraigned in numerous
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 377
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
criminal cases. Association of advocate Shri Patanwadia in the
process of Jeeva’s surrender is ample proof of this fact.
(viii) Before being presented in the Court of the Magistrate, Jeeva
(deceased) was taken to the Karanj Bhavan and was presented
before DCP Shri Surelia whose office was located at the fifth
floor of the building and that Jeeva(deceased) ascended and
descended the multiple flight of stairs without exhibiting any
discomfort or signs of pain whatsoever.
(ix) Jeeva(deceased) was produced in the Court of Magistrate in
evening of 11th June, 1992 but he did not make any kind of
complaint whatsoever to the Magistrate that he had been beaten
by the accused at the police station.
(x) That as per Jeeva’s sister, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1),
Jeeva(deceased) had complained after coming out of the
Magistrate’s Court that he had been beaten/tortured at the
police station but he could not make any complaint to the
Magistrate owing to the threat of retribution at the hands of
the police officials. However, the fact remains that Jeeva’s
sisters(PW-1 and PW-2) were free birds and nothing prevented
them from lodging a prompt complaint regarding the custodial
torture allegedly meted out to Jeeva(deceased) while he was
in police custody.
(xi) That the first complaint of the custodial torture meted out to
Jeeva(deceased) in form of the telegram(Exhibit-14) came to
be forwarded by Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) to the DGP office,
Ahmedabad on 13th June, 1992. When no action was forthcoming
on this telegram(Exhibit-14), a formal complaint came to be
filed in the Court of the Magistrate concerned on 1st July, 1992.
(xii) That as per the evidence of Medical Jurist(PW-9), the injuries
noticed on the body of the deceased at the time of the
postmortem examination which was conducted on 12th June,
1992(between 4:15 pm to 5:30 pm) were fresh and were
caused within six to eight hours of the death. The Medical
Jurist(PW-9) observed in the postmortem report(Exhibit-50)
that he noticed 600 ml fluid blood and clotted blood in the
thoracic cavity and 1600 ml of fluid blood and clotted blood in
peritoneal cavity. He also gave a pertinent reply to a question
put in cross-examination that looking to the number of injuries
378 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
including the fractures and having rupture of liver and lung, a
person could not climb a staircase without support; he would
be depressed and his expression and movements would be
painful. The fracture of sternum and ribs would cause severe
pain and would also affect the respiratory system. Due to the
bruises and the fractures, the loss of blood would be about
30-35% of the total volume of blood in the body which would
cause drop in the blood pressure.
(xiii) The prosecution tried to overcome this pertinent opinion of
the Medical Jurist(PW-9) regarding the time of injuries by
examining the expert witness-Dr. Ravindra(PW-10) who gave his
opinion(Exhibit-53) on queries being raised by the Investigating
Officer which were based on the findings in postmortem
report(Exhibit-50). Nevertheless, the expert witness(PW-10)
while deposing, did not elaborate about the opinion which he had
expressed in answer to the queries raised by the Investigating
Officer. He only formally proved the letter(Exhibit-53) without
elaborating upon its contents. In the cross-examination, the
expert witness(PW-10) admitted that the doctor who had
performed the postmortem examination would be in a better
position to give opinion about the age of injuries.
20. Having set out the admitted facts, we shall now proceed to discuss the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses. For the sake of convenience,
the details of the prosecution witnesses are reproduced hereinbelow
in a tabular form: -
PW-1 Selvin Prabhakar(Eyewitness)
PW-2 Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(Eyewitness)

21. First, we shall discuss the evidence of the star prosecution witnesses
namely, Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) and Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2).
Some relevant excerpts from the deposition of Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1)
and Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2) are reproduced hereinbelow for
the sake of ready reference: -
Examination-in-Chief of Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1)
“1.….Thereafter in the night at quarter to eleven hours PSI
Shri Vyas in the same room only nearby to the table of the
PSO making my brother to stand up facing the wall and
keeping both hands up and thereafter Shri Vyas delivered
blows with stick on the claws of the hands of my brother,
on the back, on the buttock, on the ankle and on the thigh
as also on the leg. Vyas Sir also pushed with stick on the
chest of my brother. For half an hour, as on getting beaten
up in this manner, my brother had fainted and had fallen
down. Thereafter two police persons lifted and threw away
my brother nearby to the table. At two hours in the night,
SP Shri C.G. Patel had come. I know that C.G. Patel and
at present he is present in the court as an accused person.
2. Shri C.G. Patel coming there made my brother to stand
up in such manner that his face was towards the wall and
he delivered stick blows on the hand, on the back, on the
side and also pushed with stick in the chest. Thereafter two
police persons had put my brother in the lock up. When
this happened at that time I and my sister Dhanlaxmi both
were present at the Amraivadi Police Station. We were
present in front of the lock up….
3……At quarter to six hours in the evening police persons
brought down stairs my brother and Anna. Thereafter,
policemen took both these persons at Court No. 7 and I
and my sister Dhanlaxmi had gone to the Court No.7. In
Court No. 7 these policemen were waiting for Shri Vyas
Sir with my brother and Anna as they were not having
sufficient papers. At that time my brother talked with me in
Madrasi means in Tamil language. At that time my brother
was weeping. When I asked him the reason for weeping
he told to me that- he is having severe pain in the chest
380 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and stomach and therefore he is unable to stand up. When
asked why, then he told to me that- both those persons
had beaten me up and therefore I am feeling the pain.
I asked my brother that as he has been beaten up, do
you want to file complaint before the Magistrate sir. Then
refused for the same. When I asked why, then he told to
me that- PI Shri Vyas and C.G. Patel have given me the
threat that if you will file complaint against us then, after
getting released from the jail, by planning police encounter,
and making you to run, bullet will be fired at you. Again he
stated to say that still he feels fearful….
4. On 12/6/92, at half past eleven hour in the morning two
police persons from jail had come there in civil dress and
told to us that-my brother Jeeva has died and his dead
body is kept in the PM Room of Civil Hospital and saying
this they had gone away……
….Thereafter at seven hours in the evening after conducting
the post mortem, we were handed over the dead body.
We had brought the dead body to our home. During the
night the dead body was kept at the home and on the
next day morning means on 13/6/92 the last ritual rites
were performed. During this night I had sent a telegram
from Lal Darwaja telegram office to Meghaninagar DGP
Office. The telegram stating about death of my brother in
this manner was sent…..
Thereafter, regarding this incident I had filed complaint in
the Metropolitan Court.
5…..In the year 1990, my brother Jeeva was arrested and
was sent up outside Ahmedabad in the jail. Jeeva was
kept in this manner for four months and after around four
months he was released…..
6.….During last year two cases of prohibition were filed
against me. The cases that were filed against me were
pertaining to Amraivadi Police Station. When Vyas Sir
was in charge of the Amraivadi Police Station, at that time
prohibition case was filed against me…..
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 381

….I have filed the complaint. In this complaint as witness
No.3 name of Vasu Parthasarthi is in Ex-12 complaint who
is not known to me…..
….In this complaint I did not give the name of Anna as
the witness. On 1/7/92, complaint was filed. During the
period when I had sent to telegram and filed the present
complaint, Vasu, Ravi, Hari and Anna none of these persons
had met me and I have not met them….
….It is not true that I, Jaykant and my sister and my
deceased brother Jeeva were jointly working as botleggers.
It is not true that, due to Vyas Sir joining the duty, as this
business has been closed, we have animosity towards
Vyas Sir….”

“8…..Thereafter on the next day, at 5.45 hours in the
evening when my brother was brought in the Court at that
time Advocate Shri Patanwadia met us. Prior to that we
did not inform to our advocate that as my brother is to be
produced, he should make the preparation for getting him
released on bail….
….During the period from 5.45 to 6.45 hours means for
around one hour my brother was made to sit in the Court.
During this period in the Court room many persons were
moving…..
….After my brother was brought in the Court, Patanwadia
Sir had gone out of the court compound. We had sent the
message to Patanwadia Sir and he came there and after
meeting he had gone. Our advocate stayed with us for
five-ten minutes….
….After my brother was beaten up, we met Patanwadia
Sir in the Court and during the intervening period, we did
not meet him. In the Court when Patanwadia Sir met us
for five-ten minutes, at that time he was informed that my
brother Jeeva has been beaten up in this manner and we
had shown the marks of my brother Jeeva getting beaten
up. These marks were not shown to Patanwadia Sir so
that he can take appropriate actions….

Digital Supreme Court Reports
9. When Jeeva is produced before the Magistrate and
if Jeevo makes a complaint before the Magistrate about
his getting beaten up, then threat was given to him for
killing him. We had informed about this to our advocate
Patanwadia Sir. At the time when Jeeva was produced
before the Magistrate at that time Patanwadia Sir should
remain present before the Magistrate, about which we had
not given intimation to Patanwadia Sir. However he told
to us that at the time when Jeeva will be produced before
the Hon’ble Magistrate, at that time we should inform him.
When Patanwadia Sir left the court compound means at
the second time he did not meet us…..
10…..We do not have any relationship with accused
person Mr. Vyas and we also do not have relationship
with Patel Sir. Prior to the incident I had never met any
of the accused persons…..
11.….The facts as to how he was beaten up and who had
beaten up where, have not been stated in the telegram…..
12.….My brother was kept at the Karanj Bhavan for two
and half hour. During this two and half hours, when was
my brother kept in the Karanj Bhavan I could not know
about the same. However he was taken upstairs and was
made to climb the steps about which fact I am aware. I
am not aware as to which floor he was taken. The police
persons who had brought my brother downstairs, had told
that Jeeva was taken before Sureliya Sir…..
14….Ex-14 is the copy of the telegram wherein it has been
stated that, “when my brother was produced PI Shri Vyas
Saheb had beaten up him severely with stick.”…..
19. …..It is true that I have not seen if my brother had
been beaten up by Sureliya Sir. In the Karanj Bhavan,
Sureliya Sir had beaten up my brother, if such fact has
been stated in the telegram then the same is false. It is
true that I have not seen taking my brother to Stadium. It
is true that I had filed complaint against the present two
accused persons and Sureliya Sir.
20…..It is true that prohibition cases have been filed against
my mother, myself and Pappu…..”

“2. Thereafter in the night at eleven or quarter to eleven
hours PI Shri Vyas making my brother Jeeva to stand
facing the wall and keeping hands up as support, PI Shri
Vyas had beaten up my brother. He delivered blows with
stick on the palm of his hand, on the back on the waist,
on the thigh, on the ankle and pushed with stick in the
chest. He continued to beat up my brother in this manner
for around half an hour. Thereafter my brother fainted and
had fallen down and thereafter two police persons had
come and lifting my brother they had thrown him on the

my brother. I and my sister in law Meenaben were sitting
outside the police station”….
12…For an hour Jeevo was in the Court of the Metropolitan
Magistrate. I had seen Jeeva in Court No. 7. I am not
aware as to whether on that day whether the Magistrate
of Court No. 7 was on leave or not?....
12.…..My brother Jeeva was taken at Karanj Bhavan on the
upper floor where there is staircase and from the staircase,
one can go upstairs about which I am not aware….”
22. From the testimony of Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) and Dhanlakshmi
Vaiyapuri(PW-2), it is evident that Jeeva(deceased) was having
long standing criminal antecedents and there were allegations of
bootlegging against him. He had also been detained under the Gujarat
Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985. Likewise, the evidence
of the prosecution witnesses(PW-1 and PW-2) also reveals that Anna
Dorai who too was arraigned as accused with Jeeva(deceased) in
C.R. No. 555 of 1992 also had similar criminal antecedents. However,
as per these prosecution witnesses, Jeeva(deceased) was singled
out for the custodial torture whereas even a finger was not laid on
Anna Dorai by A1 and A2. This creates a doubt in the mind of the
Court on the truthfulness of the allegations set out in the evidence
of the two sisters of Jeeva, i.e., PW-1 and PW-2.
23. PW-1 and PW-2 claim to have personally witnessed the assault
being made on Jeeva. In this background, there is a serious question
mark on the claim of PW-1 that after being produced in the Court,
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 385
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
Jeeva talked to her in Tamil language and that he was weeping and
when the witness asked Jeeva for the reason of his grief, he told
her that the police personnel had beaten him up and he was under
severe pain and was unable to standup. If at all PW-1 and PW-2 had
themselves seen the victim being beaten up, there was no occasion
for PW-1 to put a question to Jeeva as to why he was weeping or
as to the manner in which he had been beaten up.
24. This Court has considered the effect of unnatural conduct on the
credibility and evidentiary value of testimony of a witness through
a series of judicial pronouncements over time. In the case of Lahu
Kamlakar Patil and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra1, this Court held
as follows: -
“26. From the aforesaid pronouncements, it is vivid that
witnesses to certain crimes may run away from the scene
and may also leave the place due to fear and if there is
any delay in their examination, the testimony should not
be discarded. That apart, a court has to keep in mind
that different witnesses react differently under different
situations. Some witnesses get a shock, some become
perplexed, some start wailing and some run away from
the scene and yet some who have the courage and
conviction come forward either to lodge an FIR or get
themselves examined immediately. Thus, it differs from
individuals to individuals. There cannot be uniformity
in human reaction. While the said principle has to be
kept in mind, it is also to be borne in mind that if the
conduct of the witness is so unnatural and is not in
accord with acceptable human behaviour allowing
variations, then his testimony becomes questionable
and is likely to be discarded.”
(emphasis supplied)
25. In the case of Shivasharanappa and Others v. State of Karnataka2,
it was held as follows: -
1 [2012] 9 SCR 1173 : (2013) 6 SCC 417
2 [2013] 5 SCR 1104 : (2013) 5 SCC 705
386 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“22. Thus, the behaviour of the witnesses or their reactions
would differ from situation to situation and individual to
individual. Expectation of uniformity in the reaction of
witnesses would be unrealistic but the court cannot be
oblivious of the fact that even taking into account the
unpredictability of human conduct and lack of uniformity
in human reaction, whether in the circumstances of the
case, the behaviour is acceptably natural allowing the
variations. If the behaviour is absolutely unnatural, the
testimony of the witness may not deserve credence
and acceptance.”
(emphasis supplied)
26. In Narendrasinh Keshubhai Zala v. State of Gujarat3, it was held
as follows: -
“8. It is a settled principle of law that doubt cannot replace
proof. Suspicion, howsoever great it may be, is no substitute
of proof in criminal jurisprudence [Jagga Singh v. State of
Punjab, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 463]. Only such evidence is
admissible and acceptable as is permissible in accordance
with law. In the case of a sole eye witness, the witness
has to be reliable, trustworthy, his testimony worthy of
credence and the case proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Unnatural conduct and unexplained circumstances can
be a ground for disbelieving the witness.”
(emphasis supplied)
27. In the case of Harvinder Singh alias Bachhu v. State of Himachal
Pradesh4, this Court held as below: -
“18. Character and reputation do have an element
of interconnectivity. Reputation is predicated on the
general traits of character. In other words, character
may be subsumed into reputation. Courts are not
expected to get carried away by the mere background
of a person especially while acting as an appellate
forum, when his conduct, being a relevant fact, creates

[2024] 7 S.C.R. 387
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
serious doubt. In other words, the conduct of a witness
under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, is a relevant fact
to decide, determine and prove the reputation of a
witness. When the conduct indicates that it is unnatural
from the perspective of normal human behaviour, the
so-called reputation takes a back seat.”
(emphasis supplied)
28. In the case of Chunthuram v. State of Chhattisgarh5, a three judge
Bench of this Court discarded the testimony of a eyewitness on the
ground that the deceased was known to the witness and claimed
to have seen the assault on the deceased, but curiously, he did not
take any proactive steps in the matter to either report to the police or
inform any of the family members. The Court held that such conduct
of the eyewitness is contrary to human nature. The relevant extracts
from the judgment are as follows: -
“15. Next the unnatural conduct of PW 4 will require
some scrutiny. The witness Bhagat Ram was known to
the deceased and claimed to have seen the assault on
Laxman by Chunthuram and another person. But curiously,
he did not take any proactive steps in the matter to either
report to the police or inform any of the family members.
Such conduct of the eyewitness is contrary to human
nature. In Amar Singh v. State (NCT of Delhi)[2020 SCC
OnLine SC 826], one of us, Krishna Murari, J. made the
following pertinent comments on the unreliability of such
eye witness : (SCC para 32)
“32. The conviction of the appellants rests on the
oral testimony of PW 1 who was produced as
eyewitness of the murder of the deceased. Both
the learned Sessions Judge, as well as High
Court have placed reliance on the evidence of
PW 1 and ordinarily this Court could be reluctant
to disturb the concurrent view but since there are
inherent improbabilities in the prosecution story
and the conduct of eyewitness is inconsistent
with ordinary course of human nature we do not
5 [2020] 8 SCR 1071 : (2020) 10 SCC 733
388 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
think it would be safe to convict the appellants
upon the uncorroborated testimony of the sole
eyewitness. Similar view has been taken by a
three-Judge Bench of this Court in Selveraj v.
State of T.N. [(1976) 4 SCC 343] wherein on an
appreciation of evidence the prosecution story
was found highly improbable and inconsistent
of ordinary course of human nature concurrent
findings of guilt recorded by the two courts below
were set aside.”
16. The witness here knew the victim, allegedly saw the
fatal assault on the victim and yet kept quiet about the
incident. If PW 4 had the occasion to actually witness
the assault, his reaction and conduct does not match up
to ordinary reaction of a person who knew the deceased
and his family. His testimony therefore deserves to be
discarded.”
29. The two sisters(PW-1 and PW-2) were not under any restraint after
witnessing the custodial assault allegedly made on Jeeva. They
admitted in their cross-examination that they had been arraigned as
accused in a couple of prohibition cases. Thus, it can safely be inferred
that these two so-called eyewitnesses were having sufficient contact
with the legal system and were well aware of the legal machinery
and would be knowing the importance of filing a complaint promptly.
Nothing prevented these ladies from immediately approaching the
higher officials or the concerned Court to make a complaint of the
alleged assault made on their victim brother in the Amraiwadi Police
Station by the police officials.
30. Admittedly, an advocate named Shri Patanwadia was taken to the
Amraiwadi Police Station for facilitating Jeeva’s surrender and he was
also present when Jeeva(deceased) was presented in the Court on
11th June, 1992 by the Investigating Officer. Thus, the advocate was
a vital witness to unfold the truth of the case. However, he was not
examined in evidence for reasons best known to the prosecution. Even
if we assume that the advocate may have been hesitant to become a
witness in a case involving his client, the fact remains that PW-1 and
PW-2 had engaged Shri Patanwadia to represent Jeeva(deceased)
in the criminal case wherein he was arraigned as an accused and
he was taken along for effecting the surrender of Jeeva at the police
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 389
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
station. Thus, it was logically expected from PW-1 and PW-2, that
after having seen their brother Jeeva being assaulted by the police
officer, they would have immediately thought of approaching the
advocate engaged by them and tell him about the custodial torture.
However, no such step was taken by the sisters(PW-1 and PW-2)
of the deceased and this pertinent omission in failing to inform their
advocate about the custodial torture allegedly meted out to Jeeva
gives rise to a strong assumption about the unnatural conduct of
these eyewitnesses, casting a doubt on the truthfulness of their
version and discredits their testimony.
31. Keeping in view the above referred judgments and the infirmities
noticeable in the evidence of Selvin Prabhakar(PW-1) and
Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2), we are convinced that they are not
witnesses of sterling worth and their evidence is not fit to be relied
upon.
32. The prosecution claims that Naykar Vasudev(PW-3) was purportedly
arraigned as an accused on a complaint lodged by one Babu Raja
Ram and was also lodged at the Amraiwadi Police Station, at the
same time, when Jeeva was allegedly subjected to custodial violence.
He was examined as PW-3 and deposed that he saw the Police
Inspector Vyas(appellant herein)(A1) and Mr. Patel(co-accused)(A2)
beating Jeeva with sticks, etc. However, in cross-examination, the
witness admitted that he had not stated the aforesaid details to the
Sabarmati police which were being asked from him in the Court. He
also feigned ignorance as to the nature of case filed against him by
Babu Raja Ram. He also stated that he had not tried to move Jeeva
or talk to him when they were taken out of their lockup. Selvin(PW-1)
and Dhanlakshmi(PW-2) had come to the police station with breakfast
on the next morning. He did not see Jeeva in a conscious state till he
woke up in the next morning. He was released on bail at half past 3’o
clock in the afternoon. He did not tell his advocate Mr. Pathan about
the incident with Jeeva. He also admitted that he had not given the
name of Mr. Patel in the statement recorded by the Sabarmati police.
He explained that Sabarmati police had not recorded his statement
willingly. He also admitted that he did not state at the police station
that he was knowing Mr. Vyas and Mr. Patel previously. He tried to
explain that he had not divulged at the Sabarmati Police Station that
Mr. Patel had inflicted blow of stick on the chest of Jeeva as he was
not asked about the same.
390 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
33. Considering the tenor of evidence of PW-3, it is evident that his version
also suffers from grave infirmities, contradictions and omissions and
thus, implicit reliance cannot be placed on his testimony.
34. Jeeva(deceased) expired around 36 hours after his surrender before
the officials of the Amraiwadi Police Station and thus, the medical
evidence assumes great significance in the case. Dr. Digant Kalidas
Dixit(PW-5) who was working as a Medical Officer at the Civil Hospital,
Ahmedabad deposed as below: -
“On 12th June 1992 at 8/00AM to 2/00 PM I was on duty
as Casualty Medical Officer at Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad.
At about 8/30AM on that day Shri R.K. Thakur, Jailor of
Sabarmati Central Prison, Head Constable Udaysinghbhai
and police constable Maheshbhai of Central Prison,
Ahmedabad had brought one Jeevabhai Vaiyapuri from
Sabarmati Central Prison. I had examined him and I found
that the patient was unconscious. His body was cold and
calm. Pulse was not palpable and it was not possible
to record Blood Pressure: respiration was absent; heart
sounds were not heard by stethoscope; pupils were dilated,
fixed and not reactive to light. All functions were suggestive
that the patient is dead. As such I had made a note in the
Register that the person is dead.”
35. Dr. Nayan Kumar-Medical Jurist(PW-9) conducted postmortem upon
the dead body of Jeeva. The relevant excerpts from the evidence of
the Medical Jurist(PW-9) are reproduced below: -
“The injuries found by me externally were fresh in nature.
The injuries were fresh and must have occurred within
six to eight hours of the death. I have brought the case
papers. A query was raised by the Police Inspector of
Sabarmati Police Station and it was replied by my brother
doctor Dr. Desai. In reply to the query, it was stated by
Dr. Desai that the injuries were fresh and he had opined
in the said letter that the injuries were within few hours
before the death. Again there was query from the Crime
Branch and they had made a query to the tune as to what
was the meaning of “few hours” and he had given time
that it may have occurred within four to five hours prior
to the post-mortem.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 391
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
It is true that if lathi blow is given on the back side of a
person, then it will cause wheel marks.
All the bruises were red in colour. From the colour of
bruises time can be ascertained by the medical man who
has seen the injuries.
Taking into consideration the bruises and the fracture there
will be loss of blood of about 30 to 35 per cent of the total
blood. With this loss of blood gradually blood pressure will
come down. It is true that fracture of sternum and three
ribs would cause severe pain and would also affect the
respiratory system as well. In the present case there was
fracture of lung also. I am of the view that having four
fractures as in this particular case and after having rupture
of liver and lung, a person cannot climb stair-case without
support. A man would be depressed and his expression
and movements will be painful.”
36. Dr. Ravindra(PW-10) was examined by the prosecution as an expert
witness to give opinion on certain queries raised by the Investigating
Officer. Dr. Ravindra(PW-10) responded to these queries vide a letter
which was marked as Exhibit-53 during his sworn testimony. However,
what precisely were the contents of the letter were not deposed by
the expert in his evidence. Thus, mere marking of exhibit upon the
letter without the expert deposing about the opinion given therein
would not dispense with the proof of contents of the document as
per the mandate of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
37. This Court in the case of Sait Tarajee Khimchand and Others v.
Yelamarti Satyam alias Satteyya and Others6 held as follows: -
“15. The plaintiffs wanted to rely on Exs. A-12 and A-13, the
day book and the ledger respectively. The plaintiffs did not
prove these books. There is no reference to these books
in the judgments. The mere marking of an exhibit does
not dispense with the proof of documents. It is common
place to say that the negative cannot be proved. The proof
of the plaintiffs’ books of account became important because
the plaintiffs’ accounts were impeached and falsified by the
6 (1972) 4 SCC 562
392 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
defendants’ case of larger payments than those admitted
by the plaintiffs. The irresistible inference arises that the
plaintiffs’ books would not have supported the plaintiffs.”
(emphasis supplied)
38. In the case of Narbada Devi Gupta v. Birendra Kumar Jaiswal
and Another7, it was held as follows:
“16. ….The legal position is not in dispute that mere
production and marking of a document as exhibit by the
court cannot be held to be a due proof of its contents. Its
execution has to be proved by admissible evidence, that
is, by the “evidence of those persons who can vouchsafe
for the truth of the facts in issue”……”
39. Furthermore, the expert witness(PW-10) admitted in his cross-
examination that the doctor who had performed the postmortem
examination physically can give better opinion about the age of the
injuries. Thus, there is no doubt in the mind of the Court that the
evidence of the expert witness(PW-10) does not lend any support
to the case of prosecution.
40. From the evidence of the so called eyewitnesses Selvin
Prabhakar(PW-1) and Dhanlakshmi Vaiyapuri(PW-2), it is apparent
that the victim was made to climb the five flights of stairs for being
presented before DCP Shri Surelia at the Karanj Bhavan, Ahmedabad.
41. Looking to the nature of injuries noted by the Medical Jurist(PW-9)
in the postmortem report(Exhibit-50), it is impossible to believe that
the victim, having received the multiple injuries, which included
rupture of spleen, rupture of liver, fracture of ribs, would have been
in a position to walk what to say of climb five flight of stairs. The
Medical Jurist(PW-9) stated that the person having received the
injuries noted in the postmortem report(Exhibit-50) would not be able
to climb a stair case without support and that the expression of the
person and his movement would be painful. Thus, there was hardly
any possibility that after having received the injuries mentioned in the
postmortem report(Exhibit-50), Jeeva(deceased) could have climbed
up the stairs of Karanj Bhavan, Ahmedabad for being presented
before DCP Shri Surelia.
7 [2003] Supp. 5 SCR 90 : (2003) 8 SCC 745
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 393
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
42. Viewed in light of the evidence of the Medical Jurist(PW-9) who
conducted the autopsy upon Jeeva’s dead body, we are of the opinion
that, if at all, the victim had already been subjected to the injuries
noted in the postmortem report(Exhibit-50), he would be having a
severe expression of pain and it would have been impossible for
him to climb up the flights of stairs. Furthermore, on being presented
before the learned Magistrate, the expression of pain on the face of
the victim, would be prominently visible and could not have escaped
being noticed by the learned Magistrate.
43. The opinion of the Medical Jurist(PW-9) regarding the age of injuries
has not been controverted by the prosecution. The said witness was
examined by the prosecution and he has categorically opined in his
examination in chief that the injuries caused to the deceased were
fresh and must have occurred within six to eight hours of the death.
The expert witness(PW-10) also admitted that the doctor who had
performed the postmortem examination would be in a better position
to give opinion about the age of injuries. Thus, there is formidable
evidence of the Medical Jurist(PW-9) which totally discredits the
version of the so called eyewitnesses(PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3) that
Jeeva(deceased) was inflicted the injuries leading to his death while
being in police custody at the Amraiwadi Police Station. Their evidence
is contradicted in material particulars by the medical evidence and
other attending circumstances.
44. We are conscious of the proposition that where there are contradictions
inter se between the opinion of the Medical Jurist and the ocular
testimony, generally, the evidence of the eyewitnesses should be
given precedence. However, where the contradiction is so prominent
that it completely demolishes the version of the eyewitnesses who
are interested and partisan, in such cases, the Court should be
circumspect in admitting the evidence of the eyewitness while ignoring
the convincing opinion of the Medical Expert.
45. Our view is fortified by the judgment of this Court in the case of
Bhajan Singh alias Harbhajan Singh and Others. v. State of
Haryana8 wherein, it was held as below: -
“38. Thus, the position of law in such a case of contradiction
between medical and ocular evidence can be crystallised
8 [2011] 7 SCR 1 : (2011) 7 SCC 421
394 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to the effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness
has greater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence,
when medical evidence makes the ocular testimony
improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the process of
the evaluation of evidence. However, where the medical
evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all
possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular
evidence may be disbelieved.”
(emphasis supplied)
46. Considering the unimpeachable and strong opinion of the Medical
Jurist(PW-9), the probability of the victim having been assaulted
in Sabarmati Central jail leading to the fatal injuries noted in the
postmortem report(Exhibit-50) is much higher as compared to the
theory set up in the complaint and the evidence of the star prosecution
witness that Jeeva(deceased) was fatally assaulted by A1 and A2
while he was detained at the Amraiwadi Police Station.
47. The witness Udesingh Himmatsinh Chauhan(PW-8) categorically
stated in his evidence that at the time of inquest, he had seen the
victim’s clothes thoroughly and there was red dust over the said
clothes. He also stated to have seen Sabarmati Central jail from
inside and deposed that soil of the jail is red.
48. We feel that since the victim was brought dead from the Sabarmati
Central jail, it was imperative upon the Investigating Agency to
have made extensive investigation from the prison authorities so
as to rule out the possibility of injuries having been caused, while
the victim was lodged in the prison. We are also of the view that if
at all, Jeeva(deceased) was having the large number of injuries as
noted in the postmortem report(Exhibit-50), the prison authorities
would definitely have made a note thereof in the jail records at the
time of his admission in the jail premises and the observations made
at that time would be crucial for arriving at the truth of the matter.
49. The theory of motive attributed by the prosecution witnesses (PW-1
and PW-2) to the accused A1 and A2 is also not palpable. It may
be noted that the accused appellant(A1) had been posted as Police
Inspector at the Amraiwadi Police Station just a few months before
the incident. Merely because Jeeva(deceased) was having prior
criminal antecedents, that by itself, could not have provided motive
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 395
Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat
to the accused police officials to have singled him out for custodial
torture while totally sparing the co-accused Anna Dorai.
50. As an upshot of the above discussion, we are of the view that the
prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of both the accused
persons i.e. Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1)(since deceased) and
Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) by leading cogent,
convincing and reliable evidence and their conviction as recorded
by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court is not sustainable
in the eyes of law.
51. Resultantly, the accused appellant Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1)
(since deceased) deserves to be acquitted of the charges. The co-
accused Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) who too
was convicted by the trial Court and his appeal was also dismissed
by the High Court, also deserves to be given the benefit of the
conclusions drawn by us in this appeal even though no appeal has
been preferred on his behalf.
52. As a consequence, the judgment dated 4th March, 1997 passed by
the trial Court and judgment dated 13th February, 2017 passed by
the Division Bench of the High Court are quashed and set aside.
Both the accused i.e. Vinod Jaswantray Vyas(A1)(since deceased)
and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel(A2)(since deceased) are acquitted
of the charges.
53. The appeal is allowed in these terms.
54. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

(Civil Appeal No. 6144 of 2024)
08 May 2024
[Surya Kant and K.V. Viswanathan,* JJ.]","By the impugned judgment, the High Court dismissed the writ
petitions and rejected the contention of the appellants herein that
if a debt is time-barred under the Limitation Act, 1963, the same
cannot be recovered by resorting to the Haryana Public Moneys
(Recovery of Dues) Act, 1979 read with the State Financial
Corporation Act, 1951.
","Haryana Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1979 – State

appellants herein had relied upon the judgment of a three-
Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in State of Kerala and
Others vs. V.R. Kalliyanikutty & Anr. to contend that a time-
barred debt under the Limitation Act cannot be recovered under
the Recovery of Dues Act – Respondent contended that the
impugned order of the High Court was perfectly justified in
holding that the decision of this Court in V.R. Kalliyanikutty has
not considered the holding in Bombay Dyeing and Tilokchand
Motichand:
Held: The Division Bench in the impugned order do not directly
address the holding in V.R. Kalliyanikutty that the Kerala Revenue
Recovery Act did not create any additional right to recover and
enforce the outstanding amounts due – The real question that
arises is do the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 and the
Recovery of Dues Act create a distinct right and provided an
alternative mechanism of enforcement to recover the amount
due, even if the amounts due were time barred – While the
process of filing a civil suit may be barred because of the statute
of limitation, the power to recover vested through Section 32-G

of the State Financial Corporations Act read with Section 2(c)
and Section 3 of the Recovery of Dues Act is a distinct power
which continues notwithstanding that another mode of recovery
through a civil suit is barred – Understood in that sense, it does
appear that there is an additional right to enforce the claims of
the financial corporations notwithstanding the bar of limitation –
Also, in a three-judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in
K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board, 2023 INSC 560, the
Court noticed the decision in V.R. Kalliyanikutty and concluded
that statute of limitation only barred a remedy, while the right to
recover the loan through ‘any other suitable manner provided’
remains untouched – For a comprehensive consideration and an
authoritative pronouncement after taking into account all aspects,
the matter needs to be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice
of India to constitute an appropriate three-judge Bench. [Paras

1. Leave granted.
2. The present appeals arise from the judgment of a Division Bench of the
High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dated 24.04.2015
in CWP No. 15983 of 2013 and CWP No. 26452 of 2014. By the said
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 237
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
judgment, the High Court dismissed the writ petitions and rejected
the contention of the appellants herein that if a debt is time-barred
under the Limitation Act, 1963, the same cannot be recovered by
resorting to the Haryana Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1979
(for short “the Recovery of Dues Act”) read with the State Financial
Corporation Act, 1951. In so holding, the Division Bench applied the
well established principle that the Limitation Act, which applies to
Courts, merely bars the remedy and does not extinguish the debt.
3. The appellants herein had relied upon the judgment of a three-
Judge Bench of this Court in State of Kerala and Others vs. V.R.
Kalliyanikutty & Anr. (1999) 3 SCC 657 to contend that a time-
barred debt under the Limitation Act cannot be recovered under
the Recovery of Dues Act. While dealing with this contention, the
High Court relied upon the judgment of a Constitution Bench of this
Court in Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited
vs. The State of Bombay and Ors., 1958 SCR 1122 to reiterate the
principle that the Limitation Act merely bars the remedy and does not
extinguish the debt. The High Court also distinguished the judgment
in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) by holding that the judgments of this
Court in Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited
(supra) and Tilokchand and Motichand and Others vs. H.B.
Munshi and Another, (1969) 1 SCC 110 were not brought to the
notice of the Bench deciding V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra).
4. Facts in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 14213 of 2015
are as follows:
i. Respondent No.3 - M/s Khemka Ispat Limited was a Company
engaged in the business of manufacture, production, import,
export, sale and distribution of all types of Cold Rolled Strips,
steel sockets, pipe and tube products, and other allied goods.
ii. On 07.03.2003, Respondent No.3 had taken a Term Loan
under an Equipment Finance Scheme from Respondent No.1
- Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development
Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the HSIDC
Ltd.”) for a sum of Rs.105.90 lakhs. In view of the said Term
Loan, Respondent No.3 had entered into a Loan Agreement
with HSIDC Ltd. along with the personal guarantees of the
appellants herein.
238 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
iii. On 31.03.2003, the sanctioned loan amount to the tune of Rs.105
lakhs was disbursed to Respondent No.3. On 15.07.2003,
further amount of Rs. 2 lakhs was disbursed. The Loan was to
be repaid in five years with a moratorium period of six months
w.e.f. 01.10.2003.
iv. On 19.08.2004, the First Default Notice was issued to
Respondent No.3 by HSIDC Ltd. along with intimation of a
right under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act.
v. In the meantime, Respondent No.3 became a Sick Company
and reference was made to the Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction (for short “the BIFR”). On 31.07.2006,
the outstanding as on date to HSIDC Ltd. was Rs.99.32 lakhs.
vi. On 17.08.2006, BIFR declined Respondent No.3’s Reference
and the One-Time Settlement request. ING Vysya Bank also
informed the BIFR that it had taken over possession of the unit,
in accordance with which the BIFR ordered the reference to have
abated. Respondent No. 3 informed the said ING Vysya Bank
that the latter will not be responsible for the dues of the HSIDC
Ltd, and that the machinery is in possesison of the Company.
On 01.06.2007, HSIDC Ltd. took possession of the movables.
vii. While proceedings were carrying on against the principal
borrower, on 08.08.2007, Respondent No.1 HSIDC Ltd. issued
a show cause notice under Section 3(1)(b) of the Recovery of
Dues Act to Respondent No.3, which notice was returned back
with the remarks “closed/left”.
viii. On 25.09.2007, a winding up petition was filed by one of the
creditors of Respondent No.3 in C.P. NO. 171 of 2007 before
the High Court of Delhi, wherein a provisional order to wind-
up was passed and a provisional liquidator appointed. Further,
Final Order of winding up of Respondent No.3 appears to have
been passed on 24.03.2009.
ix. When the matter stood thus, on 29.10.2009, Respondent
No.1 issued a show cause notice under Section 3(1)(b) of the
Recovery of Dues Act to the Appellants and the same was
returned with the remarks “left/closed”.
x. Thereafter, on 10.01.2012, recovery notice sent to the appellants
by Respondent No.2, the Additional General Manager of HSIDC
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 239
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
Ltd., under Section 3(1)(b) of the Recovery of Dues Act was
returned with the remarks “left/closed”. The order determining
the amount due as Rs. 213.19 lakhs w.e.f 10.01.2012 was
passed by the HSIDC Ltd.
xi. On 02.02.2012, the HSIDC Ltd. sent a notice under the
provisions of the Recovery of Dues Act to the Appellants and
the Respondent No. 3 indicating the sum determined to be
due from them, which was to the tune of Rs.213.19 lakhs. On
01.03.2012, the appellants filed their reply. This was rejected by
the Respondent No. 2, Additional General Manager of HSIDC
Ltd., on 15.11.2012. Thereafter, the Respondent No. 2, Additional
General Manager of HSIDC Ltd., issued a Final Notice under
the provisions of the Recovery of Dues Act dated 15.11.2012
calling upon the appellants to pay Rs. 213.19 lakhs which was
determined to be due from the Appellants and Respondent No. 3.
xii. On 11.01.2013, recovery certificate under Section 3(1) of the
Recovery of Dues Act for a sum of Rs. 243.11 lakhs, was issued.
xiii. On 12.07.2013, appellants filed CWP No. 15983 of 2013
challenging the recovery notice. The relevant ground was
raised in the following terms:
“G. BECAUSE the Impugned Orders deserve to be
quashed as the recovery which has been initiated
by first sending the notice on 10.01.2012 under the
provisions of Haryana Public Moneys (Recovery of
Dues) Act, 1979 is much beyond the limitation to
recover any dues by the Corporation. The period
of limitation if any was 3 years from 31.07.2004,
when the amount stood and payable by Respondent
No. 3 Company (in Liqn.). The period to recovery
from either the Company or the Guarantors who
stood surety for the said amount expired in the year
2007. The recovery as per the notices sent by the
Respondent Corporation admittedly have been sent
on 10.01.2012 and subsequent thereto and therefore
any adjudication or determination of a sum due in
view of the above said Act is unsustainable and is
in any case time barred”
xiv. The Writ Petition was dismissed vide the impunged order.

5. The facts in Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition
(C) No. 23041 of 2015 are as under:
i. The Haryana Financial Corporation sanctioned a term loan
of Rs.88,74,000/- to Respondent No.5 - Cosmo Flex Private
Limited on 31.01.1996. The loan was to be repaid within a
period of eight weeks by way of quarterly instalments and the
agreed rate of interest was 19.5% with half yearly rests. On
17.03.1997, the loan agreement was executed.
ii. The appellant, who was a Director of the R-5 Company, claims
that he resigned from the Directorship of the Respondent No.
5 Company on 06.04.1998.
iii. On 29.07.1998, the loan was recalled by the Haryana Financial
Corporation.
iv. In the meantime, the appellant claims that on account of his
resignation from Directorship of the Respondent No. 5 company,
he was paid a full and final settlement from the Company
on 23.10.1998. Thereafter, he claims that the Registrar of
Companies was also intimated about the fact of his resignation,
on 12.10.1998.
v. The Haryana Financial Corporation, on 19.08.1999, sent a
notice for taking over possession of the Company’s assets and
thereafter took possession on 31.08.1999.
vi. The Haryana Financial Corporation has set-out the time-line of
events where multiple recovery notices under the Recovery of
Dues Act were issued, leading up to the determination of the
sum due from the Appellants herein, in the following terms:
“4. ...On continous non-repayment of dues, the
possession of the mortgaged properties was
taken over under section 29 of the State Financial
Corporations Act, 1951. The primary security was
disposed of by the Corporation for Rs. 61.00 lakh
on 16.12.1999. The Recovery Certificate was issued
on 22.09.2000 to the Collectors Gurgaon, Delhi &
Srinagar and were returned in the year 2001 on the
ground that no immovable/movable properties were
available in the names of directors/guarantors and
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 241
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
they were not residing at the given addresses. The
fresh Recovery Certificate was issued on 10.08.2005
u/s 3 of Haryana Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues)
Act, 1979 in the name of Collectors, Sri Nagar,
Delhi & Gurgaon through Collector, Gurgaon. The
Recovery Certificate pertaining to Collectors, Sri
Nagar & Delhi were returned by Collector, Gurgaon
to send the same directly to the concerned Collectors
as there was no provisions to send the same by
one Collector to another Collector. After obtaining
legal opinion as per which, it was advised that as
per Section 3 of the Revenue Recovery Act, the
Collector may send a certificate to other Collector,
Recovery Certificates were returned to Collector,
Gurgaon. However, Recovery Certificate in the
name of Collector Gurgaon was being pursued. As
Recovery Certificate with Collector Delhi was not
traceable in his office, photocopy of the Recovery
Certificate was re-lodged with Collector Delhi on
16.04.2008. It was informed by Collector Delhi
that the Recovery Certificate lodged with them
was not in their jurisdiction and as such recovery
cannot be effected. Further, the directors residing
at Gurgaon & Delhi had shifted to some unknown
places. However, as the new addresses of one
of the Directors Sh. Charanjeet Gaba were found
out, fresh RCs were issued to Collectors Delhi
(Central, East, South & West), Gurgaon & Sri Nagar
(Kashmir) on 19.04.2010 u/s 32G of the State
Financial Corporations Act. However, the Recovery
Certificate dated 19.04.2010 was quashed by the
High Court of Punjab and Haryana vide order dated
02.12.2011 passed in CWP No. 12226 of 2010 on the
ground that the same was issued without affording
the Petitioners an opportunity of personal hearing.
The Corporation was given liberty to proceed after
hearing the petitioner and giving him opportunity to
file his objections.

7. Accordingly, personal hearings were given to
defaulting borrowers/guarantors for sum determination
under Section 32-G of the State Financial Corporations
Act, 1951 on 11.12.2013, 19.03.2014 and 06.08.2014,
objection raised by Sh. Charanjeet Gaba, borrower/
guarantor verbally during the personal hearing as
well as through various representations were dealt in
detail in the proceeding of personal hearing held on
06.08.2014. However, as no constructive proposal
for repayment/settlement under the new Settlement
Policies of HFC-2011 was recived from Sh. Charanjeet
Gaba or other borrowers/guarantors, Recovery
Certificate was issued to Collectors, Srinagar, Solan
(HP), Gurgaon & Delhi on 08.10.2014 for the recovery
of Rs. 14,55,11,275/- with further interest @24%
from 01.03.2014, the same stand challenged by the
petitioner before the Hon’ble High Court as stated
above.”
(emphasis supplied)
vii. The appellant challenged the proceedings dated 06.08.2014 by
filing CWP No. 26452 of 2014. By the Impugned Order, the Writ
Petition was dismissed.
viii. In the Special Leave Petition filed before this Court, the case of
the Appellant as regards the debt being time-barred is as follows:
“A. Because the order/proceedings dated 06.08.2014
passed by Respondent No. 3 under Section 32 (G)
of the State Financial Corporation Act for recovery
of Rs. 14,55,11,275/- along with pendente lite and
future interest could not have been issued as the
recovery had already become time barred against the
petitioner. Since the recovery on the basis of mortgaged
property had already been effected by way of sale
dated 16.12.1999 the remaining amount could not
be recovered beyond the limited time of three years”
Contentions of the Parties
6. Before us, learned counsel for the appellants contend that the
judgment in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) directly covers the issue
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 243
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
as according to them, in substance, there is no difference between
the provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, with which V.R.
Kalliyanikutty (supra) was concerned, and the Recovery of Dues
Act of the State of Haryana. According to the learned counsel, V.R.
Kalliyanikutty (supra) has clearly held that Acts, like the Recovery
of Dues Act, are intended for speedy recovery of loans and do not
create a new right in the creditor. It is their contention that on that
reasoning the word “due” in the Recovery of Dues Act cannot be
interpreted to include time-barred debts.
7. Learned counsel for the respondent-Corporations strongly refuted
these contentions and contended that the impugned order was
perfectly justified in holding that the decision of this Court in V.R.
Kalliyanikutty (supra) has not considered the holding in Bombay
Dyeing (supra) and Tilokchand Motichand (supra).
Questions that arise for this Court’s consideration
8. The questions that fall for consideration are, firstly, are the appellants
right in contending that the recovery proceedings initiated against them
under the Recovery of Dues Act are barred in view of the principle
laid down in V.R.Kalliyanikutty (supra). Secondly, if they are right,
then is the decision in V.R. Kalliyainkutty (supra) contrary to the
holding in Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited
(supra) and if so what is the course open for this two-Judge Bench.
Reasoning in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra)
9. To appreciate these contentions, we need to first understand the
law laid down in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra). The primary question
of law involved in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) was, whether a debt
which is barred by the law of limitation can be recovered by resorting
to recovery proceedings under the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act,
1968. This apart, the Bench, after setting out the scheme of the
Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, examined the further question as to
whether the object of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act was only for
speedy recovery or if the said Act also enlarged the right to recover.
Additionaly, the Bench addressed the question as to whether the
words “amount due” would refer to the amounts repayable under the
terms of the Loan Agreement executed between the debtor and the
creditor irrespective of whether the claim was time-barred or whether
the words refer to only those claims which are legally recoverable.
244 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
10. Relying upon Hansraj Gupta vs. Dehra Dun-Mussorie Electric
Tramway Co. Ltd., AIR 1933 PC 63, the Bench in Kalliyanikutty
(supra) held that the Kerala Recovery Act did not create any new
right and that it merely provided a process for speedy recovery. In
view of the same, it held that since the Act did not create any right,
the person claiming recovery cannot claim recovery of amounts which
are not legally recoverable. The Bench thereafter distinguished the
judgment in Khadi Gram Udyog Trust v. Ram Chandraji Virajman
Mandir, Sarasiya Ghat, Kanpur, (1978) 1 SCC 44 as having no
applicability to the interpretation of the Kerala Revenue Recovery
Act. It further relied on the judgment of this Court in Director of
Industries, U.P. vs. Deep Chand Agarwal (1980) 2 SCC 332 to
reinforce its holding on the interpretation of the word ‘due’ under the
Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. The plea that the statute of limitation
merely bars the remedy and does not touch upon the right was not
accepted by the Court by holding that the rights of the parties are
not enlarged by the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and that unless
the Act expressly provided for enlargement of claims extending to
the recovery of barred debts, that principle will not apply. Ultimately,
the Court held that under the provisions of the Kerala Revenue
Recovery Act a debt which is barred by the law of limitation cannot
be recovered.
11. The Division Bench, in the impugned order, has relied on Bombay
Dyeing (supra) to reinforce the point that the statute of limitation only
bars the remedy and does not extinguish the debt. The decision in
Bombay Dyeing (supra) was a case where the Constitution Bench
of this Court reiterarted the principle that statutes of limitation only
bar the remedy and do not extinguish the right and so holding, it
found that the definition of “unpaid accumulations” in that case did
apply to wages of employees that were time-barred. The Court went
on to hold that while time-barred wages did vest in the State, since
the Act did not, in that case, provide for disbursement of the wages
to the workers whose claims could be established and since there
was no provision for the workers making the claim, the Act was held
to be contrary to Article 31(2) of the Constitution, which then existed.
12. It is well settled that the laws of limitation only bar the remedy and
do not extinguish the right, except in cases where title is acquired
by prescription. We may note here that V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra)
did not dispute the principle that the statute of limitation only bars
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 245
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
the remedy and does not extinguish the debt. After considering
this principle it went onto hold that there was no enlargement of
right in the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. The impugned order, in
the present case, further holds that Bombay Dyeing (supra) and
Tilokchand and Motichand (supra) were not brought to the notice
in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra). The decision in Tilokchand and
Motichand (supra) was a case which inter alia dealt with extension of
the principles of laches and res judicata to writ proceedings and have
no direct relevance to the present controversy. The impugned order,
in the present case, thereafter goes on to hold that the machinery
for recovery under the Recovery of Dues Act or the State Financial
Corporations Act do not have the trappings of a Court to hold that
the provisions of the Limitation Act have no application for the same.
Discussion and Reasoning:-
13. In our view, the findings of the Division Bench in the impugned order
do not directly address the holding in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra)
that the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act did not create any additional
right to recover and enforce the outstanding amounts due.
14. The real question that arises is do the State Financial Corporations
Act, 1951 and the Recovery of Dues Act create a distinct right and
provided an alternative mechanism of enforcement to reover the
amount due, even if the amounts due were time barred? To answer
this question, we need to examine the relevant statutory provisions.
15. The objects and reasons of the State Financial Corporations Act are
relevant for the purposes of the present case. They read as under:
“The intention is that the State Corporations will confine
their activities to financing medium and small scale
industrial and will, as far as possible, consider only such
cases as are outside the scope of the Industrial Finance
Corporation. The State Governments also consider that
the State Corporations should be established under a
special Statute in order to make it possible to incorporate
in the Constitution necessary provisions in regard to
majority control by Government, guaranteed by the State
Government in regard to the repayment of principal, and
payment of a minimum rate of dividend on the shares,
restriction on distribution of profits and special powers for
the enforcement of its claims and recovery of dues.
246 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
The main features of the Bill are as follows:-
(vii) The Corporation will be authorised to make long-
term loans to industrial concerns and to guarantee loans
raised by industrial concerns which are repayable within
a period of not exceeding 25 years. The Corporation will
be further authorised to underwrite the issue of stocks,
shares, bonds or debentures by industrial concerns, subject
to the provision that the Corporation will be required to
dispose of any shares, etc., acquired by it in fulfilment of
its underwriting liability within a period of 7 years.
(ix) The Corporation will have special privileges in the
matter of enforcement of its claims against borrowers”
(emphasis supplied)
Section 32-G of the State Financial Corporations Act reads as under:-
“32G. Recovery of amounts due to the Financial
Corporation as an arrear of land revenue.—Where any
amount is due to the Financial Corporation in respect of
any accommodation granted by it to any industrial concern,
the Financial Corporation or any person authorised by it
in writing in this behalf, may, without prejudice to any
other mode of recovery, make an application to the
State Government for the recovery of the amount due
to it, and if the State Government or such authority, as
that Government may specify in this behalf, is satisfied,
after following such procedure as may be prescribed,
that any amount is so due, it may issue a certificate for
that amount to the Collector, and the Collector shall
proceed to recover that amount in the same manner
as an arrear of land revenue.”
(emphasis supplied)
16. This apart, for the purposes of the present case, the relevant
provisions of the Recovery of Dues Act, being Section 2(c) and Section
3 of the Recovery of Dues Act, are for the sake of convenience set
out hereinbelow:
“2. Definitions
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 247
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
(c) “defaulter” means a person who either as principal or
as surety, is a party –
(i) to any agreement relating to a loan, advance or
grant given under that agreement or relating to credit
in respect of, or relating to hire-purchase of, goods sold
by the State Government or the Corporation, by way of
financial assistance;
and such person makes any default in repayment of the
loan or advance or any instalment thereof or, having
become liable under the conditions of the grant to refund
the grant or any portion thereof, makes any default in the
refund of such grant or portion or any instalment thereof or
otherwise fails to comply with the terms of the agreement;
3. Recovery of certain dues as arrears of land revenue
(1) Where any sum is recoverable from a defaulter –
(a) by the State Governemnt, such officer as it may,
by notificaitaon, appoint in this behalf;
(b) by a Corporation or a Government company,
the Managing Director thereof, shall determine
the sum due from the defaulter.
(2) The Officer or the Managing Director, as the case
may be, referred to in sub-section (1), shall send a
certificate to the Collector mentioning the sum due
from the defaulter and requesting that such sum
together with the cost of proceedings be recovered
as if it were an arrear of land revenue.
(3) A certificate sent under sub-section (2) shall be
conclusive proof of the matters stated therein and
the Collector, on receipt of such certificate, shall
proceed to recover the amount stated therein as an
arrear of land revenue.
(4) No civil court shall have jurisdiction –
(a) to entertain or adjudicate upon any case; or
(b) to adjudicate upon or proceed with any pending
case;
248 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
relating to the recovery of any sum due as aforesaid from
the defaulter. The proceedings relating to the recoery
of the sums due from the defaulters, pending at the
commencement of this Act in any civil court, shall abate.”
(emphasis supplied)
17. It will be clear from Section 32-G of the State Financial Corporations
Act that the Section confers a right of recovery on the financial
corporation, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery which
includes the right to file a suit. The conferment of such a right to
recover an ‘amount due’ as arrears of land revenue, notwithstanding
any other remedy, is for a public purpose and in public interest.
18. At this point, we deem it appropriate to refer to a passage from
Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edition, on the concepts of “Right”
and “Power” [Page 224, 229 & 230]:
“42. Legal rights in a wider sense of the term
We must now consider the wider use of the term, according
to which rights, do not necessarily correspond with duties.
In this generic sense, a legal right may be defined as any
advantage or benefit conferred upon a person by a rule
of law. Of rights in this sense there are four distinct kinds.
These are (1) Rights (in the strict sense), (2) Liberties,
(3) Powers, and (4) Immunities. Each of these has its
correlative, namely (1) Duties, (2) No-Rights, (3) Liabilities,
and (4) Disabilities.
A debt is not the same thing as a right of action for its
recovery. A former is the right in the strict and proper
sense, corresponding to the duty of the debtor to pay; the
latter is a legal power, corresponding to the liability of
the debtor to be sued. That the two are distinct appears
from the fact that the right of action may be destroyed (as
by prescription) while the debt remains
A power may be defined as ability conferred upon a
person by the law to alter, by his own will directed to that
end, the rights, duties, liabilities or other legal relations,
either of himself or of other persons. Powers are either
public or private. The former are those which are vested
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 249
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
in a person as an agent or instrument of the functions of
the state; they comprise the various forms of legislative,
judicial, and executive authority…The correlative of power
is a liability. This connotes the presence of a power vested
in someone else, as against the person with the liability.
It is the position of one whose legal rights (in the wide
sense) may be altered by the exercise of a power…the
most important form of liability is that which corresponds
to the various powers of action and prosecution. Such
liability is independent of the question whether the
particular action or prosecution will be successful, and is
therefore independent of (say) the duty to pay damages
for a civil wrong”
(emphasis supplied)
As would be clear from the passage above, a debt is not the same
thing as the right of action for its recovery. While the debt is the
right in the creditor with the corelative duty on the debtor the right
of action for recovery is in the nature of a legal power. While the
process of filing a civil suit may be barred because of the statute of
limitation, the power to recover vested through Section 32-G of the
State Financial Corporations Act read with Section 2(c) and Section
3 of the Recovery of Dues Act is a distinct power which continues
notwithstanding that another mode of recovery through a civil suit
is barred. Understood in that sense, it does appear that there is an
additional right to enforce the claims of the financial corporations
notwithstanding the bar of limitation. The same is the case with
the provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act which fell for
consideration of this Court in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra).
19. No doubt, even where the statute of limitation does not apply, the
power has to be exercised within a reasonable time. In that scenario
the further question would be: Whether the time available would
analogously be the time available for execution of decrees? Since
no specific arguments have been advanced and since the Division
Bench in the Impugned Order was not engaged with that issue, we
refrain from dealing with the same.
20. In the context of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, the decision in
V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) needs to be discussed. The relevant
portions of the judgment is extracted hereinbelow:
250 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“3. ...Under Section 71, however, there is a provision for
extending the Act to recovery of certain other dues if the
Government is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in
public interest. Under Section 71 it is provided as follows:
“71. Power of Government to declare the Act
applicable to any institution.—The Government may,
by notification in the Gazette, declare, if they are
satisfied that it is necessary to do so in public interest,
that the provisions of this Act shall be applicable to
the recovery of amounts due from any person or
class of persons to any specified institution or any
class or classes of institutions, and thereupon all
the provisions of this Act shall be applicable to such
recovery.”
4. In exercise of its powers under Section 71, the State
Government has issued a notification bearing SRO No.
797 of 1979 by which the provisions of the said Act have
been made applicable to the recovery of the amounts
due from any person to any bank on account of any loan
advanced to such person by that bank for agriculture or
agricultural purposes. Under another notification SRO
No. 851 of 1979 issued under Section 71 by the State
Government the provisions of the said Act are also made
applicable to the recovery of amounts due from any person
or class of persons to the Kerala Financial Corporation.
Thus in public interest the State Government has made
the said Act applicable for speedy recovery of loans given
by a bank for agricultural purposes as well as for speedy
recovery of loans given by the Kerala Financial Corporation.
The overall scheme of the Act, therefore, is to provide for
speedy recovery, not merely of public revenue but also
of certain other kinds of loans which are required to be
recovered speedily in public interest.
5. Explaining analogous provisions of the U.P. Public
Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1965, this Court in Director
of Industries, U.P. v. Deep Chand Agarwal [(1980) 2 SCC
332 : AIR 1980 SC 801] held that the said Act is passed
with the object of providing a speedier remedy to the State
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 251
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
Government to realise the loans advanced by it or by the
Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation. Explaining the need
for speedy recovery, it says that the State Government
while advancing loans does not act as an ordinary banker
with a view to earning interest. Ordinarily it advances loans
in order to assist the people financially in establishing an
industry in the State or for the development of agriculture,
animal husbandry or for such other purposes which would
advance the economic well-being of the people. Moneys
so advanced have to be recovered expeditiously so that
fresh advances may be made for the same purpose. It
is with the object of avoiding the usual delay involved in
the disposal of suits in civil courts and providing for an
expeditious remedy that the U.P. Act had been enacted. It
was on this ground that this Court upheld the classification
of loans which are covered by the said U.P. Act in a
separate category. It held that this is a valid classification
and the provisions of the Act are not violative of Article 14.
6. The same reasoning would apply to the loans which
are covered by the said notifications under Section 71
of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. Agricultural loans
and loans by the State Financial Corporation are also
loans given in public interest for the purpose of economic
advancement of the people of the State, to help them in
agricultural operations or establishment of industries. For
this reason the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act has been
made applicable to such loans so that there can be a
speedy recovery of such loans and the amounts can be
utilised for similar objects again.
18. In the premises under Section 71 of the Kerala Revenue
Recovery Act claims which are time-barred on the date
when a requisition is issued under Section 69(2) of the
said Act are not “amounts due” under Section 71 and
cannot be recovered under the said Act. Our conclusion
is based on the interpretation of Section 71 in the light
of the provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act.”
Under the said provision, the Government in public interest could
make the Revenue Recovery Act applicable to recovery of amounts
252 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
due to any person or class of persons or to any specified institution
or any class or classes of institutions and on such notification by the
provisions of the Act was applicable to such recovery. Admittedly,
in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) a notification was issued making the
provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act applicable to the
Kerala Financial Corporation. The Kerala Financial Corporation is
also a Corporation under the said Financial Corporation Act to which
Section 32-G applied.
21. In our view, while the Court focused on the implication of a notification
under Section 71 of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act whereunder
the Government could declare the Act applicable to any institution, the
attention of the Court in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) was not drawn
to the powers envisaged under the State Financial Corporations
Act which were also applicable to the recovery of debts in Kerala.
As noticed above, the statement of objects and reasons of the
State Financial Corporations Act refers to providing State Financial
Corporations with ‘special privileges in the matter of enforcement of
claims against borrowers’. This is reflected through Section 32-G of the
State Financial Corporations Act which we have set-out hereinabove.
22. This Court in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) held that the words ‘amounts
due’ occuring in the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act would only include
legally recoverable debts i.e. debts which are not time-barred. For
this purpose, it may be apposite to refer to the relevant portions from
the decision in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra):
“9. In the case of Hansraj Gupta v. Dehra Dun-Mussoorie
Electric Tramway Co. Ltd. [AIR 1933 PC 63 : 60 IA 13] the
Privy Council was required to interpret the words “money
due” under Section 186 of the Companies Act, 1913.
Section 186 dealt with the recovery of any money due to
the company from a contributory. Interpreting the words
“money due”, the Privy Council said that the phrase would
only refer to those claims which were not time-barred.
10. The same reasoning would apply in the present case
also. The Kerala Revenue Recovery Act does not create
any new right. It merely provides a process for speedy
recovery of moneys due. Therefore, instead of filing a
suit, (or an application or petition under any special Act),
obtaining a decree and executing it, the bank or the financial
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 253
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
institution can now recover the claim under the Kerala
Revenue Recovery Act. Since this Act does not create
any new right, the person claiming recovery cannot claim
recovery of amounts which are not legally recoverable
nor can a defence of limitation available to a debtor in a
suit or other legal proceeding be taken away under the
provisions of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. In fact,
under Section 70 of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, it
is provided that when proceedings are taken under this
Act against any person for the recovery of any sum of
money due from him, such person may, at any time before
the commencement of the sale of any property attached
in such proceedings, pay the amount claimed and at the
same time deliver a protest signed by himself to the officer
issuing the demand or conducting the sale as the case
may be. Sub-section (2) of Section 70 provides that when
the amount is paid under protest, the officer issuing the
demand or the officer at whose instance the proceedings
have been initiated, shall enquire into the protest and
pass appropriate orders. If the protest is accepted, the
officer disposing of the protest shall immediately order
the refund of the whole or part of the money paid under
protest. Under sub-section (3) of Section 70, the person
making a payment under protest shall have the right to
institute a suit for the refund of the whole or part of the
sum paid by him under protest.
11. Therefore, under Section 70(3) a person who has
paid under protest can file a suit for refund of the amount
wrongly recovered. In law he would be entitled to submit
in the suit that the claim against which the recovery has
been made is time-barred. Hence no amount should have
been recovered from him. When the right to file a suit under
Section 70(3) is expressly preserved, there is a necessary
implication that the shield of limitation available to a debtor
in a suit is also preserved. He cannot, therefore, be deprived
of this right simply by making a recovery under the said
Act unless there is anything in the Act which expressly
brings about such a result. Provisions of the said Act,
however, indicate to the contrary. Moreover, such a wide
254 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
interpretation of “amount due” which destroys an important
defence available to a debtor in a suit against him by the
creditor, may attract Article 14 against the Act. It would be
ironic if an Act for speedy recovery is held as enabling a
creditor who has delayed recovery beyond the period of
limitation to recover such delayed claims.
12. In the case of New Delhi Municipal Committee v. Kalu
Ram [(1976) 3 SCC 407] relying on the Privy Council
decision in Hansraj Gupta v. Dehra Dun-Mussoorie Electric
Tramway Co. Ltd. [AIR 1933 PC 63 : 60 IA 13] this Court
interpreted Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction
of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1958 in a similar way.
Under that section where any person is in arrears of rent
payable in respect of any public premises, the Estate Officer
may, by order, require that person to pay the same within
such time and in such instalments as may be specified
in the order. While considering the meaning of the words
“arrears of rent payable” this Court examined whether
Section 7 creates a right to realise arrears of rent without
any limitation of time. The Court observed that the word
“payable” is somewhat indefinite in import and its meaning
must be gathered from the context in which it occurs. In
the context of recovery of arrears of rent under Section
7, this Court said that if the recovery is barred by the law
of limitation, it is difficult to hold that the Estate Officer
could still insist that the said amount was payable. When
a duty is cast on an authority to determine the arrears of
rent the determination must be in accordance with law.
Section 7 only covers arrears not otherwise time-barred.
16. There is no question, however, in the present case of
any payment voluntarily made by a debtor being adjusted
by his creditor against a time-barred debt. The provisions
in the present case are statutory provisions for coercive
recovery of “amounts due”. Although the necessity of
filing a suit by a creditor is avoided, the extent of the
claim which is legally recoverable is not thereby enlarged.
Under Section 70(2) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act
the right of a debtor to file a suit for refund is expressly
preserved. Instead of the bank or the financial institution
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 255
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
filing a suit which is defended by the debtor, the creditor
first recovers and then defends his recovery in a suit filed
by the debtor. The rights of the parties are not thereby
enlarged. The process of recovery is different. An Act
must expressly provide for such enlargement of claims
which are legally recoverable, before it can be interpreted
as extending to the recovery of those amounts which
have ceased to be legally recoverable on the date when
recovery proceedings are undertaken. Under the Kerala
Revenue Recovery Act such a process of recovery would
start with a written requisition issued in the prescribed form
by the creditor to the Collector of the district as prescribed
under Section 69(2) of the said Act. Therefore, all claims
which are legally recoverable and are not time-barred on
that date can be recovered under the Kerala Revenue
Recovery Act.”
(emphasis supplied)
23. In order to arrive at the conclusion that the words ‘amounts due’
occurring in the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act would only include
legally recoverable debts i.e. debts which are not time-barred, the
Court in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) relies upon three decisions. First
is the decision of the Privy Council in Hansraj Gupta (supra), second
is the decision of the this Court in New Delhi Municipal Committee
vs. Kalu Ram, (1976) 3 SCC 407 and third, is the decision of this
Court Deep Chand (supra).
24. The decision in Hansraj Gupta (supra) was in the context of an
application filed by the Official Liquidator praying that the Appellants
therein, in their capacity as contributories, must be ordered to pay
a debt owed by them to the Company. This Application was made
under Section 186(1) of the Indian Companies Act, which provides
as follows:
“Court may, at any time after making a winding-up Order,
make an order on any contributory for the time being settled
on the list of contributories to pay, in manner directed by
the order, any money due from him or from the estate of
the person whom he represents to the company exclusive
of any money payable by him or the estate by virtue of
any call in pursuance of this Act.”
256 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
The decision in Hansraj Gupta (supra) involved interpretation of
the words ‘any money due’ occurring in Section 186(1) of the Indian
Companies Act. The Privy Council, while following and affirming the
judgment of the Lahore High Court in Sri Narain v. Liquidator, Union
Bank of India, ILR 4 Lah. 109, held that a time-barred debt could
not be enforced by a summary order under Section 186 since the
section did not create new liability or confer new rights and since it
merely created a summary procedure for enforcing existing liabilities.
25. Additionally, in Hansraj (supra) the Limitation Act applied to the
company court, since it was a ‘court’. Section 46-B of the State
Financial Corporations Act provides that the said Act was to have
effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in
any other law. The authority under the Recovery of Dues Act not
being a ‘court’, the provisions of the Limitation Act cannot proprio
vigore apply.
26. The decision of this Court in Kalu Ram (supra) is again based fully
on the interpretation of the Privy Council in Hansraj (supra). That
apart, the decision in Kalu Ram (supra) involved the interpretation
of the words ‘arrears of rent payable’ under Section 7 of the Public
Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1958. The Court
noted that the word ‘payable’ generally means ‘that which should be
paid’ and thereafter concluded that the word can only be interpreted
to mean dues which are legally recoverable. The provisions herein
use the words ‘amounts due’ and are provisions which create a right
to recover through a separate mechanism, notwithstanding the right
to file a civil suit.
27. At this juncture, we also deem it fit to note the decision of this Court in
KGU Trust (supra).The decision in KGU Trust (supra) was rendered
while interpreting the words ‘entire amount of rent due’ occurring in
Section 20(4) of the U.P Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and
Eviction) Act, 1972. While the landlord could file an eviction suit on
the ground that the tenant is in arrears of rent, the Tenant was given
an option to resist this eviction suit by depositing this ‘entire amount
of rent due’. While the decision in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) rightly
states that the said provision was a benefit being conferred on the
tenant, we deem it necessary to refer to the other findings of this
Court in KGU Trust (supra) which are of relevance for the purposes
of answering the questions before us. In arriving at the conclusion
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 257
K.P. Khemka & Anr. v. Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure
Development Corporation Limited & Ors.
that the ‘entire amount of rent due’ would include even time-barred
claims, the Court in KGU Trust (supra) specifically noted the decision
in Bombay Dyeing (supra) and the principle that the Limitation Act
only bars the remedy and does not extinguish the debt. The Court
also noted Halsbury’s Laws of England where it is stated that the
Limitation Act would only take away the remedy while leaving the
right untouched, and that ‘if a creditor whose debt is statute-barred
has any means of enforcing his claim other than by action or
set-off, the Limitation Act does not prevent him from recovering by
those means’. [Paragraph 4, 5 of KGU Trust (supra)]
28. Deep Chand (supra) was a case where there was a challenge to
the constitutionality of Section 3 of the U.P Public Moneys (Recovery
of Dues) Act, 1965. The argument was that Section 3 provided two
remedies to the Government – one being a suit and another being a
remedy under the Act – and that the latter remedy was more onerous
and without any guidelines in law. [Paragraph 2 of Deep Chand
(supra)] In upholding the Constitutionality of the U.P Act, the Court
noted that the object of the U.P Act was to enable speedy recovery
of money and that therefore, the classification was valid. [Para 6 of
Deep Chand (supra)]
29. While it is true that the U.P Act, similar to the Haryana Revenue
Recovery Act [in the present case] or the Kerala Revenue Recovery
Act, was enacted with the object to have speedy recovery of dues,
this does not take away from the fact that the right was vested in
the Financial Corporations to recover the loans through the said
Acts, notwithstanding any other right, including the right to file a suit.
30. As far as the finding in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) regarding
Section 70(3) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, which provides
for a suit by the debtor for refund after payment under protest, is
concerned, what is to be noted is that the defence for the State
Financial Corporations that the State Financial Corporations Act
conferred an additional right to recover amounts due would still be
applicable. Therefore, the existence of the right to the debtor under
Section 70(3) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act cannot be said
to be determinative of the issue.
31. It would also be apposite to point out that the applicability of V.R.
Kalliyanikutty (supra) to Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003
recently fell for consideration before a three-judge Bench of this Court
258 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board, 2023 INSC 560.
One of the questions which the Court was faced with was whether
the statutory bar on recovery of electricity dues after the limitation
period of two years provided under Section 56(2) of the Electricity
Act, 2003 would have an implication on the civil remedies of the
Electric Utilities to recover such arrears. The auction purchasers, who
had purchased premises where electricity had been disconnected
due to defaults of the previous owners, argued that the period of
limitation would apply to such dues and that Electric Utilities could
not demand such time-barred dues from them. The Court in K.C.
Ninan (supra), after a comprehensive analysis of the scheme of the
Electricity Act, held that the power to initiate proceedings to recover
the electricity dues was independent of the power to disconnect
electrical supply. Thereafter, the Court noticed the decision in V.R.
Kalliyanikutty (supra) and concluded that statute of limitation only
barred a remedy, while the right to recover the loan through ‘any
other suitable manner provided’ remains untouched. Having so
held, the Court rejected the argument of the auction purchasers
and concluded that the bar of limitation under Section 56(2) of the
Electricity Act would only restrict the remedy of disconnection under
Section 56 of the Electricity Act and that the Electric Utilities were
entitled to reocver electricity arrears through civil remedies or in
exercise of its statutory power.
32. In view of what has been pointed out hereinabove, we are of the
opinion that, for a comprehensive consideration and an authoritative
pronouncement after taking into account all aspects, including those
dealt with hereinabove, the matter needs to be placed before the
Hon’ble Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate three-
judge bench.
33. Let the papers along with this order be placed before Hon’ble the
Chief Justice of India for seeking appropriate directions from His
Lordship, in this regard.

relating to contract/tender disputes under writ jurisdiction; whether
the action on the part of the respondent in cancelling the tender

whether the said action could be termed as arbitrary or unfair

to another authority – Action to cancel the tender, if amenable
to writ jurisdiction and whether was arbitrary and influenced
by extraneous considerations:
Held: The tender was not terminated pursuant to any terms of the
contract subsisting between the parties – Respondent cancelled
the tender saying that there was technical fault in the tender
that was floated – Thus, the respondent exercised powers in its
executive capacity as the action to cancel the tender fell outside
the purview of the terms of the contract – Hence, the present
matter is not purely a contractual dispute even if related to a
tender, as the dispute involves a public law element – Although
there is no discharge of a public function by the respondent

towards the appellant yet there is a right to public law action
vested in him against the respondent in terms of Article 14 – Thus,
writ petition filed by the respondent was maintainable and the
relief prayed for could have been considered by the High Court
in exercise of its writ jurisdiction – On facts, just a month prior to
cancelling the tender, the respondent issued work stop notice to
the appellant, asking to stop all work in respect of the tender in
view of the handing over of the operation & maintenance of the
concerned underpasses by the respondent to another authority,
Kolkata Municipal Corporation – Appellant pointed out that the
work stop orders were misconceived as the respondent continued
to retain the custody as well as the advertisement rights of the
concerned underpasses – As such the respondent even after
the change in policy, remained well within its rights to continue
charging license fee in lieu of the advertisement rights by way
of the tender issued to the appellant – Change in policy had no
bearing on the cancellation of the tender – It was only after the
appellant highlighted why the work stop orders were misconceived
and uncalled for, that the respondent immediately flipped its stance
and in its notice of cancellation that was issued just 1-month
later, it attributed ‘technical faults’ in the tender – Furthermore,
although the internal-file notings mention about the policy change
in the operation and maintenance of the concerned underpasses,
however, the cancellation of the tender for work was neither due
to any technical fault nor due to the policy change but it was at
the behest of the concerned minister who suggested to cancel the
tender – The concerned minister’s decision to cancel the tender on
account of purported ‘change in policy’ was without any application
of mind, capricious and influenced by malice – Cancellation of the
tender was not in public interest – Present lis is a classic case of
an arbitrary and capricious exercise of powers by the respondent
to cancel the tender on the basis of extraneous considerations
and at the behest of the concerned Minister-In-Charge – Notice
of cancellation was non-est, quashed – Impugned judgment of
the High Court upholding the decision of the respondent to cancel
the tender, set aside. [Paras 60-62, 103-105, 107, 122]

file of the respondent in respect of the tender to contend
that the cancellation thereof was arbitrary and influenced by
extraneous considerations:
Held: Once a decision has been officially made through proper
means and channel, any internal deliberations or file notings
that formed a part of that decision-making process can certainly
be looked into by the Court for the purposes of judicial review
in order to satisfy itself of the impeccability of the said decision
and whether it conforms to the principles enshrined in Article
14 of the Constitution – In the present case, if the purported
action of cancelling the tender was claimed to have been taken
in view of certain technical faults in the same or even a change
in policy, the same ought to be clearly reflected from its internal
file notings as-well, pursuant to which the purported decision
was taken – However, in the entire records, there is no whisper
of any particular clauses of the tender that was floated nor of
any conflict or technical fault in the same, as claimed by the
respondent – From the internal-file notings it is evident that the
notice of cancellation issued to the appellant was at the behest
of the concerned minister – Respondent recorded that, because
instructions for cancellation were received from the higher-ups,
there was no option but to proceed with the cancellation – Even
before the respondent could properly and thoroughly explore the
possibility of acceding to such request by consulting its legal
cell, the tender was cancelled only at the instance and specific
instructions of the concerned minister. [Paras 85, 90]

materials and circumstances in order to ensure that State actions
are fair, transparent, and accountable – Public interest cannot
be used as a pretext to arbitrarily terminate contracts and there
must be a clear and demonstrable ramification or detriment on
the public interest to justify any such action – Considerations
of public interest should not be narrowly confined to financial
aspects – Courts must have a more holistic understanding of
public interest wherever the fairness of public authorities is in
question, giving due regard to the broader implications of such
action on the stability of contractual obligations – Merely because
the financial terms of a contract are less favourable over a period
of time does not justify its termination – Respondent’s stance of a
mere possibility of fetching higher license fees was no ground to
cancel the tender for the purposes of rectifying it, especially when
it failed to demonstrate as to how there was a technical fault in
the tender or how potential interested bidders did not participate
due to it or how fetching higher license fees was more than a
mere possibility. [Paras 115, 116, 118]
Tenders – Sanctity of Public-Private Partnership Tenders –
Termination of tenders – Public authorities cautioned – Duty
of Courts:
Held: Public tenders are a cornerstone of governmental
procurement processes, ensuring transparency, competition, and
fairness in the allocation of public resources – It emanates from the
Doctrine of Public Trust which lays down that all natural resources
and public use amenities & structures are intended for the benefit
and enjoyment of the public – Public tenders are designed to
provide level playing field for all potential bidders – Its sanctity
lies in their role in upholding the principles of equal opportunity
and fairness – Once a contract has come into existence through a
valid tendering process, its termination must adhere strictly to the
terms of the contract, with the executive powers to be exercised
only in exceptional cases by the public authorities and that too in
loathe – Arbitrary terminations of contract create uncertainty and
unpredictability, thereby discouraging public participation in the
tendering process – Courts are duty bound to zealously protect the
sanctity of any tender duly conducted and concluded by ensuring
that the larger public interest of upholding bindingness of contracts
are not sidelined by a capricious or arbitrary exercise of power by
the State – Failure on the part of the courts to zealously protect
536 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the binding nature of a lawful and valid tender, would erode
public faith in contracts and tenders – Public authorities also to
be circumspect in disturbing or wriggling out of its contractual
obligations through means beyond the terms of the contract in
exercise of their executive powers. [Paras 124-126]
Contractual disputes – Judicial review – Amenability to
writ jurisdiction – Private law element vis-à-vis public law
element – Demarcation – Assessment:
Held: Demarcation between a private law element and public law
element in the context of contractual disputes, may be assessed
by ascertaining whether the dispute or the controversy pertains
to the consensual aspect of the contract or tender in question or
not – Judicial review does not extend to fixing contract stipulations
but ensures that the public authorities act within their authority to
prevent arbitrariness – Judicial review is permissible to prevent
arbitrariness of public authorities and to ensure that they do not
exceed or abuse their powers in contractual transactions and
requires overseeing the administrative power of public authorities
to award or cancel contracts or any of its stipulations – Although
disputes arising purely out of contracts are not amenable to writ
jurisdiction yet keeping in mind the obligation of the State to act
fairly and not arbitrarily or capriciously, when contractual power is
being used for public purpose, it is certainly amenable to judicial
review. [Paras 57-59]
Contract/tender disputes – Contractual disputes concerning
public authorities – Arbitrary exercise of powers by public
functionaries – Challenge to – Constitution of India – Article
14 – Duty of Courts:
Held: Where State action is challenged on the ground of being
arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the State would be under an
obligation to comply with the basic requirements of Article 14
and not act in an arbitrary, unfair and unreasonable manner –
This is the constitutional limit of their authority – There is a jural
postulate of good faith in business relations and undertakings
which is given effect to by preventing arbitrary exercise of powers
by the public functionaries in contractual matters with private
individuals – With the rise of the Social Service State more and
more public-private-partnerships continue to emerge, which makes
it all the more imperative for the courts to protect the sanctity of
such relation. [Para 56]
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 537
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
Contract – Contractual disputes – Arbitrariness of State
actions – Meaning and Import of – Test of reasonableness –
Vice of arbitrariness – When attracted:
Held: The question, whether an impugned action is arbitrary or
not, is to be answered on the facts and in the circumstances of a
given case – An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is
any discernible principle emerging from the impugned act and if
so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness – Where a mode is
prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in following
that procedure, the performance of the act otherwise and in a
manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which
is reasonable, may itself attract the vice of arbitrariness – Every
State action must be informed by reason and an act uninformed
by reason, is arbitrary – To enthuse efficiency in administration,
a balance between accountability and autonomy of action should
be carefully maintained – Whether the public authority acted bona
fide would be gauged from the impugned action and attending
circumstances – The authority should justify the action assailed
on the touchstone of justness, fairness and reasonableness –
Test of reasonableness is more strict – Supporting an order with
a rationale which in the circumstances is found to be reasonable
will go a long way to repel a challenge to State action – The
reasons need not in every case be part of the order as such – If
there is absence of good faith and the action is actuated with an
oblique motive, it could be characterised as being arbitrary – A
total non-application of mind without due regard to the rights of
the parties and public interest may be a clear indicator of arbitrary
action – Another way to assess whether an action complained of
could be termed as arbitrary is by scrutinizing the reasons assigned
to such an action – However, the Court is not supposed to delve
into every minute details of the reasoning assigned, but should
only see whether the reasons were earnest, genuine and had a
rationale with the ultimate decision – What is under scrutiny in
judicial review of an action is the decision-making process and
whether there is any element of arbitrariness or mala fide – Thus,
the question to be answered in such situations is whether the
decision was based on valid considerations. [Paras 65, 67, 69-71]

3. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the tendering process was undertaken
and the appellant herein on 13.06.2022 submitted his bid with a
quotation of Rs. 29,55,555/- for the Beliaghata Underpass and Rs.
23,55,555/- for the Swabhumi Underpass. Out of the total bids
received, the appellant’s quotations were found to be the highest
and was classified as ‘H1’ for both the underpasses.
4. Accordingly, the respondent issued two Letter of Intents dated
27.06.2022 in favour of the appellant, accepting the quotation
offered by him and declaring his firm as the successful bidder for
the aforementioned tender, and a formal Memorandum of Tender
for Work was executed and issued to the appellant.
5. As per the Memorandum of Tender for Work, the detailed ‘Scope
of Work’ inter-alia included (i) the sweeping of floors & cleaning of
the walls, stairwell, escalators, railings and glass-fixtures, (ii) regular
emptying of dustbins and removal / processing of waste trash, (iii)
upkeep of the garden and plants and (iv) the maintenance of light-
fittings, escalators, water pumps and other electro-mechanical fixtures.
6. Furthermore, the Special Terms & Conditions of the Memorandum,
more particularly Clause 35 therein stipulated that the contract would
be liable to be terminated inter-alia in the event of any failure, breach
or non-compliance of any of the obligations or terms delineated in
the tender by the successful bidder.
7. Upon completion of all the formalities, the Work Orders dated
18.10.2022 were issued by the Executive Engineer, pursuant to
which the appellant commenced his work in terms of the contract.
8. On 01.12.2022, the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs
Department, Government of West Bengal issued an Order directing
that the maintenance of the roads and drainage of the E.M. Bypass
including the two subject underpasses shall be handed over by
the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) i.e., the
respondent herein to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). The
said order reads as under: -
“Government of West Bengal
Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department
NAGARYAN, DF-8, Sector-I

Memo No. 5783 – UDMA-22012(14)/11/2022
Date : 01.12.2022

Digital Supreme Court Reports
ORDER
KMDA was the custodian for the maintenance of the E.M
Bypass connecting the northern and southern part of the
city and starts from northern hub Ultadanga to Garia in the
South. The road length is 15.6 Km which runs along the
eastern ring of the city. After careful consideration it has
been decided that the maintenance of the road alongwith
the drainage be handed over from KMDA to KMC with the
following scope of activities.
(1) The defects in carriageway would be maintained and
restored by KMC henceforth.
(2) The existing carriageway alongwith the surface and
underground drainage would be maintained by KMC.
The conservancy in and around the Eastern Bypass
would also be maintained by KMC.
(3) Subject to clearance from KMDA, KMC would issue
NOC to all utility and service providers. The cost of
road restoration from the charges to be levied is to
be paid to KMC by all utility and service providers.
(4) The right of collecting revenues from the advertisement
displays will remain with KMDA.
(5) All the structures, as the new or old Bridges, Culverts,
FoBs etc. will be under the custody of KMDA.
(6) All development activities along the road except for the
Bridges, Culverts, FoBs etc. will be taken up by KMC.
(7) KMC would remain custodian for illumination of the
Bypass.
(8) The green verge along the E.M. Bypass to be
maintained by KMC.
The order is issued in the interest of public service.
Sd/-
Principal Secretary
to the Govt. of West Bengal”
9. As per the aforesaid Order dated 01.12.2022, the maintenance and
restoration of carriageway, structures, underground drainage and
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 545
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
development activities of the E.M. Bypass Area was taken over by
the KMC. However, the Order specifically, clarified that the right of
collecting revenue from advertisements displayed would continue to
remain with the KMDA.
10. Thereafter, in light of the aforesaid order, the Executive Engineer,
KMDA under instructions issued by the competent authorities sent a
notice dated 24.01.2023 to the appellant herein asking him to stop
all work in respect of the maintenance of the two underpasses with
immediate effect in view of the handing over of the maintenance of
the E.M. Bypass to the KMC.
11. In response to the above, the appellant sent a letter dated 25.01.2023
inter-alia pointing out that as per the Urban Development and
Municipal Affairs Department’s Order dated 01.12.2022, the custody
and rights of revenue of all structures, bridges, culverts etc. including
the concerned underpasses, continued to remain with the respondent,
and requested to recall the notice dated 24.01.2023 asking him to
stop the work.
12. However, on 07.02.2023, the respondent issued one another notice
to the appellant stating that the tender for work of maintenance has
been cancelled on account of a technical fault in the tender. It was
stated therein that the tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ & ‘not
well defined’ and that had created ambiguity resulting in financial
losses to the respondent. The said Notice of Cancellation reads
as under: -
“Date: 07.02.2023
To,V.S. Advertising,
65/268, M.N. Sarkar Road,
Siliguri, West Bengal 7340001
Sub: Cancellation of Work/Tender
Sir,
The cited tender is hereby cancelled by the Authority in
KMDA. We would state with regret that the tender has
been found having technical fault, non-specific and not
well defined thus creating ambiguity for obvious reasons.
By this, the Authority is incurring financial loss as well.

We regret for the inconvenience caused to you and are
ready to reimburse the cost you have so far incurred in
the work. This has been decided that the license fee
deposited by you and the cost incurred for construction
activity and maintenance work would be refunded as per
actual assessment by the divisional engineers based upon
the approved drawing and execution.
This is for your information with kind compliance please.
Sd/-

Roads & Bridges Sector, KMDA”
13. It is pertinent to note from the aforesaid that, no reference was made
as regards handing over of the maintenance to KMC which was
previously alluded to, for stopping all work pertaining to the tender.
B. IMPUGNED ORDER
14. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the appellant preferred a writ petition
being WPA No. 3381 of 2023 before the High Court of Calcutta
assailing the respondent’s Notice dated 07.02.2023 cancelling the
tender for work of maintenance of the two underpasses.
15. The aforesaid writ petition referred to above came to be rejected
by the High Court vide its order dated 24.04.2023, wherein the Ld.
Single Judge held that the decision to cancel the tender had to be
taken on account of the administrative exigencies and also due to
the ‘change in policy’. It was further held that the decision to cancel
the tender was not borne out of any ulterior motives on the part of
the respondent. The decision of the learned Single Judge is based
on two grounds: -
(i) First, the High Court took the view that the decision
to cancel the tender cannot be termed as an arbitrary
action on the part of the respondent. The appellant was
put to prior notice as regards the change of hands of the
management of the concerned underpasses, much before
the ultimate cancellation notice was issued. It further
observed that, since the notice of cancellation dated
07.02.2023 specifically provided the reasons for cancelling
the tender i.e., the technical faults found in the tender that
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 547
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
was floated, there was no element of arbitrariness in the
said action. The relevant observations read as under: -
“11. [...] The effect of the administrative decision
was reiterated in the stop-work request of
24.01.2023 where the reason given for the
stop-work was also the “changed scenario”
of handover of the maintenance work of E.M.
Bypass to KMC from KMDA. Hence, the reason
for the stop-work and the impugned cancellation
is a change of policy for administrative
convenience simpliciter.
xxx xxx xxx
18. In the present case, the impugned
cancellation of 07.02.2023 cannot be described
as a bolt from the blue since the petitioner
was put on notice of the impending change
in circumstance on 24.01.2023 where the
reason for the change was also conveyed to
the petitioner. The order dated 01.12.2022 of
the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs
Department stating that the maintenance of
the E.M. Bypass would be handed over from
the KMDA to KMC provides the rationale
for the impugned cancellation. Seen in this
backdrop, it cannot be said that the impugned
letter of cancellation of the tender /work was
issued with an ulterior motive or for extraneous
considerations. In fact, the letter of cancellation
provides further reasons, namely, that the tender
has been found to be non-specific and having
technical faults. This would also be borne out
from clauses 10 and 14 of the Special Terms
and Conditions of the tender document which
give rise to conflicting interpretations on the
placement of the signboards. Hence, besides
the administrative decision to hand over the
maintenance of E.M. Bypass from KMDA to
KMC, the respondent KMDA as the tendering
548 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
authority, has a right to rectify the ambiguities
in the bid document by cancelling the same.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) Secondly, the appellant could not have redressed his
grievances by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, as there was
no failure of any statutory duty or public law element
involved. Moreover, since the relief sought was essentially
in the nature of specific performance, it could have been
prayed for only under ordinary civil law and not by way of
a writ petition. The relevant observations read as under: -
“20. It is well settled that a contractual dispute
with a public law element would be amenable
to writ jurisdiction. The present dispute however
arises out of a private contract for maintenance
of underpasses in the E.M. Bypass and
advertisement rights over certain spaces within
the contracted area. The rights following out of
the contract are purely private in nature and
there is nothing to show that the performance
of the contract or the consequence therefrom
would affect the public at large or even a
sizeable section of the public. A public law
element is generally understood to mean the
reach of an obligation to a large section of
the public or the obligation affecting the lives
and livelihood of the general public by its very
nature. M.P. Power sounded a cautionary note
in such cases where the State cites monetary
gains or losses as reason for termination of
a contract. This is also not’ the case at hand
since the reasons given for cancellation were
on a wholly different plane.”
21. The above reasons persuade this Court to
hold that the remedy available to the petitioner is
in the realm of private law and not under Article·
226 of the Constitution which contemplates
certain tests including that the dispute must
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 549
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
have a public law element. The complaint of
the petitioner is essentially for the specific
performance of the contractual obligation of the
respondent KMDA. Doubtless, the petitioner can
avail of appropriate civil remedies for redress
which would include damages for breach of the
contractual terms.
(Emphasis supplied)
16. Aggrieved with the aforesaid, the appellant went in appeal before
a Division Bench of the High Court by way of M.A.T. No. 744 of
2023, wherein the appeal court finding no fault in the decision of the
learned Single Judge, dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed
the judgment of the learned Single Judge referred to above.
17. In view of the aforesaid, the appellant is here before this Court with
the present appeal.
C. DEVELOPMENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE
PENDENCY OF THE PRESENT APPEAL.
18. During the pendency of the present appeal, the appellant herein
preferred a RTI seeking further information on the respondent’s
internal note-file pertaining to the cancellation of the subject tender.
19. The Public Information Officer, KMDA vide its reply dated 18.08.2023
provided the internal file-notings of the respondent on the aforesaid
tender. In the internal file-notings of the respondent, the following
entries / notes are relevant: -
a) As per Note #91 dated 30.12.2022, the respondent in view of
the maintenance of the concerned underpasses being handed
over to KMC, was contemplating the possibility of cancelling the
tender for work. The relevant noting reads as under: -
“Note # 91
Recently maintenance of EM Bye pass has been
handed over to KMC. Thus, in this changed scenario
we may cancel the work order.

CHRMN (KMDA)”
550 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
b) As per Note #95 dated 10.01.2023, the respondent instructed
that the tender be cancelled in view of the maintenance of the
concerned underpasses being handed over to KMC. However,
since the respondent was in doubt as regards the legality &
validity of such decision, it opined that the opinion of the Legal
Department may be sought first before any action of cancellation
is taken. However, as an interim measure, it decided to issue
a notice to stop all work in respect of the tender. The relevant
noting reads as under: -
“Note # 95
[...] Now, as instructed by the competent authority
of KMDA keeping in view of the recent changed
scenario of handing over of maintenance of E.M.
Bypass from KMDA to KMC, cancelling the work order
as instructed may require judicious action towards
implementing the same and to make it lawful, legal
advice from Law-Cell, KMDA may be required so that,
KMDA doesn’t fall in any legal obligation. However,
for immediate compliance of the order, a notice to
stop the works in all respect with regards to the
two above-mentioned tenders may be served to the
agency for immediately stopping his all activities at
site till further notice. As instructed, a draft Letter is
attached herewith for his kind perusal and direction
in this regard. [...]

c) Again, in Note #96, it was noted that since the competent
authority of the respondent was desirous to cancel the tender,
the respondent was of the view that the opinion of its legal
cell be obtained first before such action is taken. The relevant
noting reads as under: -
“Note # 96
[...]
As per Note#91¸Competent Authority desires to
cancel the Work Order.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 551
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
In Note#95¸a draft letter has been attached for
approval towards issuance to the agency to stop any
type of work related to this project.
Considering the Chronological development and
acceptance by Authority, the matter may kindly be
viewed lawfully, so that, if it is cancelled by this end,
no legal action is taken by the Agency.
Submitted for necessary action.

SE (RBBRDG) (KMDA)”
d) In Note #97 dated 16.01.2023, the respondent has noted that
since the competent authority had decided to cancel the work
tender there was no option but to cancel it. However, the
respondent once again insisted that a legal opinion may be
sought first, in order to avoid further litigations. The relevant
noting reads as under: -
“Note # 97
Sub: Cancellation of Work Order of Mainte-
nance of two Underpasses
A concurrence of Law Cell, KMDA may kindly be
obtained before cancelling the Work Order of the
existing agency. There is no different opinion than
to get this cancelled, once this has been decided by
the Authority but a legal opinion may be sought for
avoiding further litigations. [...]

e) Thereafter, it could be seen from Note #101 dated 19.01.2023,
that the other officials of the authority also concurred with the
respondent’s opinion to first seek advice of its legal cell on
the possible consequences in the event the tender for work is
cancelled. The relevant observations read as under: -

instructed the officials of the respondent on his own to cancel
the tender, upon which the respondent undertook the steps to
duly comply with such instructions. The relevant noting reads

h) Thereafter, as per the last entry in the internal notings – Note
#110 dated 03.02.2023, the respondent floated one another
proposal seeking approval to cancel the tender, which culminated
into the final notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 which is
the subject matter of challenge in the present litigation.
20. During the course of hearing of this appeal, it was brought to the
notice of this Court that after the work order issued in favour of
the appellant was cancelled, the respondent floated a fresh tender
dated 15.05.2023 for the work of maintenance of the very same
underpasses, the selection process for which stood completed and
that the tender had been awarded along with the work order(s) to
one another third-party agency.
21. This Court was further apprised of the order dated 16.09.2023
passed by the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department,
Government of West Bengal, modifying its earlier order dated
01.12.2022 to the extent that both i) the operation & maintenance
of 37 bridges, flyovers, underpasses, etc. including the concerned
two underpasses along with ii) the right to collect revenue towards
the advertisement rights for the said structures, shall be taken over
by KMC from KMDA. The said letter reads as under: -

22. In view of the fact that a fresh tender had already been awarded to
a third-party, coupled with the fact that the right to collect revenue
from the advertisements for the concerned underpasses had been
handed over to KMC, the counsel for the respondent submitted that
the matter had since become infructuous.
D. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
23. Mr. Shyam Divan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
appellant submitted that the impugned notice of cancellation dated
07.02.2023 is manifestly arbitrary and tainted with extraneous
considerations. He submitted that though the impugned notice
purports to cancel the tender on the ground of being ambiguous and
non-specific, but in reality the said action was at the behest of the
concerned Minister-In-Charge who directed such cancellation without
any justifiable cause. In this regard he placed strong reliance on the
internal-file notings of the respondent.
24. He submitted that the reasons assigned for cancelling the tender in
the impugned notice are not to be found in the entire file of notings
maintained by the respondent. He further pointed out that the file of
the internal notings indicate that, before the respondent could take
a judicious call the concerned minister issued a specific direction on
the basis of which the cancellation was undertaken & that to without
any application of mind.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 555
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
25. Mr. Divan also submitted that no orders to stop the work could have
been issued by the respondent on account of handing over of the
maintenance to another authority, because even after the handover,
the respondent continued to operate & maintain the underpasses
including the licensing rights for advertisements.
26. He further submitted that, although the terms of the contract provided
for assigning cogent grounds for termination, yet the same was not
followed and instead the respondent arbitrarily proceeded to cancel
the tender.
27. In the last, Mr Divan submitted that the contention as regards the
financial losses being suffered is erroneous, as the respondent
voluntarily accepted the bid that was submitted by the appellant,
and even as per the notings in the file the tender was generating
more revenue than earlier.
E. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
28. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent submitted that the present matter being purely a contractual
dispute was rightly not entertained by the High Court in exercise of
its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
29. He further submitted, that the decision to cancel the tender was bona
fide and had to be taken considering the technical faults in the same.
He submitted, that there was ambiguity in the tender as regards
whether it was lawful to put up advertisements at the places outside
the underpasses, due to which, many interested bidders might not
have participated in the tender. The respondent was of the view that
a higher license fee could be fetched by rectifying such ambiguity.
30. Mr. Dwivedi also submitted that the decision to cancel the tender
had to be taken to enable the respondent to float separate tenders,
one for the maintenance of the underpasses and the other for the
licensing advertisement rights. Thus, the decision was taken in
public interest. He submitted that the decision to cancel the tender
was on the basis of a change in the policy, and thus cannot be
said to be arbitrary.
31. He further submitted that no reliance could have been placed on the
notings in the file maintained by the respondent, as the file notings
556 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
are only internal deliberations. Such notings cannot be construed
as decisions of the respondent and thus, creates no right in favour
of the appellant.
32. In the last, Mr Dwivedi submitted that since during the pendency of
the present appeal, the operation, maintenance and the licensing
rights for the advertisements have been taken over by a third party,
the present appeal has been rendered infructuous.
F. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION
33. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
having gone through the materials on record, the two pivotal questions
that fall for our consideration are as under: -
I) What is the scope of judicial review of the actions of the State
in the matters relating to contract / tender disputes under writ
jurisdiction?
II) Whether the action on the part of the respondent herein in
cancelling the tender vide its notice dated 07.02.2023 was
amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court? If so,
whether the said action could be termed as arbitrary or unfair
and in consequence of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India?
G. ANALYSIS
i. Scope of Judicial Review of the actions of the State in
matters relating to Contract / Tender under Writ Jurisdiction.
a. Earlier Position of Law and Misconception of the State as
a Largesse.
34. Over the years, the scope of judicial review and the extent to which a
Court can interfere in disputes arising out of contracts or tenders has
seen a significant development, marked by a nuanced understanding
of the critical role of administrative discretion. The judicial quest
in administrative matters has always been to find a right balance
between i) allowing leeway to the States in deciding the exercise of
their administrative discretion in matters pertaining to policy and ii) the
need to ensure fairness and propriety in such administrative actions.
35. Earlier, the position of law was that any dispute arising out of a
contract entered into with the State or its instrumentalities could not
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 557
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
be adjudicated by the court under its writ jurisdiction, as in all such
cases, it could be said that the ‘real grievance’ was essentially only
one being that of breach of a contract for which the appropriate
remedy would be an ordinary suit and not a writ petition. One of
the earliest judicial pronouncements in this regard is the decision
of this Court in Radhakrishna Agarwal & Ors. v. State of Bihar &
Ors. reported in (1977) 3 SCC 457 wherein the following relevant
observations were made: -
“19. [...] None of these cases lays down that, when the
State or its officers purport to operate within the contractual
field and the only grievance of the citizen could be that
the contract between the parties is broken by the action
complained of, the appropriate remedy is by way of a
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution and not an
ordinary suit. There is a formidable array of authority
against any such a proposition. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
36. It was further explained by this Court in Radhakrishna Agarwal
(supra) that once the State or its instrumentalities enter into a
contract, any dispute arising out of that contract cannot be decided
in writ jurisdiction as their relations no longer remain governed by the
constitutional provisions, and it is only the contract which thereafter
determines the rights and obligations of the parties. Any claim to a
right flowing from a contract cannot be redressed through the writ
jurisdiction except where some statute steps in and confers some
special statutory power or obligation on the State in the contractual
field or if the agreement is in the nature of a statutory contract. The
relevant observations read as under: -
“10. [...] But, after the State or its agents have entered into
the field of ordinary contract, the relations are no longer
governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally
valid contract which determines rights and obligations
of the parties inter se. No question arises of violation of
Article 14 or of any other constitutional provision when
the State or its agents, purporting to act within this field,
perform any act. In this sphere, they can only claim rights
conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the
terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in
558 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and confers some special statutory power or obligation
on the State in the contractual field which is apart from
contract.
11. In the cases before us the contracts do not contain any
statutory terms or obligations and no statutory power or
obligation which could attract the application of Article 14
of the Constitution is involved here. Even in cases where
the question is of choice or consideration of competing
claims before an entry into the field of contract facts
have to be investigated and found before the question
of a violation of Article 14 could arise. If those facts
are disputed and require assessment of evidence the
correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily
by talking detailed evidence, involving examination and
cross-examination of witnesses, the case could not be
conveniently or satisfactorily decided in proceedings
under Article 226 of the Constitution. Such proceedings
are summary proceedings reserved for extraordinary
cases where the exceptional and what are described as,
perhaps not quite accurately, “prerogative” powers of the
Court are invoked. We are certain that the cases before
us are not such in which powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution could be invoked.”
(Emphasis supplied)
37. Similar view as above, was reiterated by this Court in Premji Bhai
Parmar & Ors. v. Delhi Development & Ors. reported in (1980) 2
SCC 129 at para 8 and in Divisional Forest Officer v. Bishwanath
Tea Co. Ltd. reported in (1981) 3 SCC 238 wherein it was held
that any right to relief flowing from a breach of contract cannot be
entertained under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of the court, even
if the action of the State or its instrumentality was unauthorized in
law. The relevant observations read as under: -
“9. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of,
a party complaining of such breach may sue for specific
performance of the contract, if contract is capable of being
specifically performed, or the party may sue for damages.
Such a suit would ordinarily be cognizable by the civil
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 559
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
court. The High Court in its extraordinary jurisdiction would
not entertain a petition either for specific performance of
contract or for recovering damages. A right to relief flowing
from a contract has to be claimed in a civil court where a
suit for specific performance of contract or for damages
could be filed. This is so well-settled that no authority is
needed.
10. In substance, this was a suit for refund of a royalty
alleged to be unauthorisedly recovered and that could
hardly be entertained in exercise of the writ jurisdiction
of the High Court.”
(Emphasis supplied)
38. We do not propose to dwell any further, on the position of law that
existed earlier, and leave it at rest with one last reference to the
decision of this Court in Bareilly Development Authority & Anr. v.
Ajai Pal Singh & Ors. reported in (1989) 2 SCC 116, wherein this
Court once again reiterated that no writ can be issued in contractual
disputes between the State and an aggrieved party where the rights
or claims arise or stem only from the terms of the contract. The
relevant observations read as under: -
“22. There is a line of decisions where the contract entered
into between the State and the persons aggrieved is non-
statutory and purely contractual and the rights are governed
only by the terms of the contract, no writ or order can be
issued under Article 226 of the Constitution of India so as
to compel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract
pure and simple [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
39. Thus, for a period of time the courts recognized that there was a clear
brightline distinction between when a State or its instrumentalities could
be said to be acting in its executive capacity and when it could be said
to be acting in its private capacity, with the existence of a ‘contractual
relation’ inter-se the parties being the determinative factor. Wherever,
there was a contract, the State’s relations and all its actions were said
to be within the field of a contract i.e., within the realm of private law,
and the courts would resile from interfering with the same under their
writ jurisdiction or embarking upon a judicial review of such actions.
560 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
40. Such reluctance on the part of the courts stemmed from its
understanding that State or any of its instrumentalities must have
the flexibility or the discretion to take decisions that are in the best
interest of the public and efficient governance. Government being the
decision-maker of the State is said to be the best judge of when a
contract or an agreement is in its interest and by its extension in the
interest of the public, and as such the courts should not interfere in
the State’s discretion to award or terminate contracts. One another
reason why contractual disputes were precluded from being espoused
under the writ jurisdiction of the courts was due to the summary nature
of such proceedings, which do not allow for an exhaustive review
unlike civil suits. [See: Radhakrishna Agarwal (supra) at para 11]
41. This simplistic approach of the courts in deeming every act and
action of the State which was complained of as nothing more than a
‘contractual dispute’ or a case of ‘breach of contract’ often led to the
State abusing its position and acting unfairly under the misconceived
notion, that all its actions such as award of contracts or tenders were
nothing but a ‘largess’ – a generosity bestowed upon its citizens, which
it can at its own whims choose to deny, alter, modify, or take away
without any consequences. This often led to a conflation of power
with duty, and resulted in every arbitrary exercise of power by the
State under the guise of a ‘contractual dispute’ to remain unchecked
and undisputable before the courts and out of the reach of judicial
review, undermining the rights of the citizen to have their interests
safeguarded and protected. We may in this regard refer to M/s Indian
Medicines Pharmaceuticals Corp Ltd. v. Kerala Ayurvedic Co-
operative Society Ltd. reported in (2023) SCC OnLine SC 5 wherein
this Court speaking eruditely through one of us, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud,
CJI made the following pertinent observations: -
“11 The welfare State plays a crucial role in aiding
the realisation of the socioeconomic rights which are
recognised by the Constitution. Social welfare benefits
provided by the State under the rubric of its constitutional
obligations are commonly understood in the language of
‘largesse’, a term used to describe a generous donation.
Terming all actions of government, ranging from social
security benefits, jobs, occupational licenses, contracts
and use of public resources – as government largesse
results in doctrinal misconceptions. The reason is that this
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 561
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
conflates the State’s power with duty. The Constitution
recognises the pursuit of the well-being of citizens as a
desirable goal. In doing this the Constitution entrusts the
State with a duty to ensure the well-being of citizens.
Government actions aimed at ensuring the well-being
of citizens cannot be perceived through the lens of
a ‘largess’. The use of such terminology belittles the
sanctity of the social contract that the ‘people of India’
entered into with the State to protect and safeguard
their interests.
xxx xxx xxx
13. In the early 1950s’, judicial review of the process of
concluding contracts by government was limited. The
courts allowed the State due deference on the ground of
governmental policy. In C.K Achuthan v. State of Kerala, AIR
1959 SC 490 a Constitution Bench of this Court held that
it is open to the Government ‘to choose a person to their
liking, to fulfil contracts which they wish to be performed.’
The Court observed that when one party is chosen over
another, the aggrieved party cannot claim the protection
of Article 14 since the government has the discretion to
choose with whom it will contract.”
(Emphasis supplied)
42. Before proceeding further to discuss how the scope of judicial review
came to be evolved, we would like to refer to the observations made
by this Court in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India reported in (1987) 1
SCC 395 which are significant, and read as under: -
“31. [...] Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs
of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the
economic developments taking place in the country. As
new situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to
meet the challenge of such new situations. Law cannot
afford to remain static. We have to evolve new principles
and lay down new norms which would adequately deal
with the new problems which arise in a highly industrialised
economy. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
562 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
b. Concept of ‘Public Law’ Element: Scope of Judicial Review
in Contractual Matters.
43. Over a period of time the courts recognized the crucial role of
judicial oversight in preventing the abuse of power and maintaining
public confidence in the administrative process. Courts developed
various doctrines and principles to guide their review, such as the
principles of natural justice, reasonableness and proportionality.
These principles ensured that the administrative actions are not
arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious. By enforcing such standards,
the courts also ensured that the rule of law was maintained and the
individual rights were protected.
44. The interplay between judicial review and administrative discretion
has been a dynamic process. As new challenges and complexities
kept on arising before the courts as regards the State’s actions and
governance, it continued to refine its approach. This ongoing dialogue
between the courts and the executive branch contributed to the
development of a more accountable and transparent administrative
framework, paving the way for the exercise of judicial review even in
the realm of contractual disputes to achieve a fine balance between
efficiency and fairness in policy decisions on the one hand and the
rights of individuals and overall public interest on the other.
45. In Mahabir Auto Stores & Ors. v. Indian Oil Corporation reported in
(1990) 3 SCC 752, this Court expressed doubts over the correctness
of the earlier position of law, that actions of the State in the private
contractual field cannot be questioned in writ jurisdiction. This Court
further held that even if the inter-se relation of parties with the State
is governed purely by a contract, the method, motive and decision
of the State would be subject to judicial review on the grounds of
relevance and reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality
and non-discrimination. The relevant observations read as under: -
“12. [...] It appears to us that rule of reason and rule
against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play
and natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in
situation or action by State instrumentality in dealing with
citizens in a situation like the present one. Even though
the rights of the citizens are in the nature of contractual
rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision
of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 563
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and
reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality and non-
discrimination in the type of the transactions and nature
of the dealing as in the present case.
13. The existence of the power of judicial review however
depends upon the nature and right involved in the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. It is well settled that
there can be “malice in law”. Existence of such “malice in
law” is part of the critical apparatus of a particular action
in administrative law. Indeed “malice in law” is part of the
dimension of the rule of relevance and reason as well as
the rule of fair play in action.
xxx xxx xxx
20. [...] we are of the opinion that it would be appropriate
to state that in cases where the instrumentality of the
state enters the contractual field, it should be governed
by the incidence of the contract. It is true that it may not
be necessary to give reasons but, in our opinion, in the
field of this nature fairness must be there to the parties
concerned, and having regard to the large number or
the long period and the nature of the dealings between
the parties, the appellant should have been taken into
confidence. Equality and fairness at least demands this
much from an instrumentality of the State dealing with a
right of the State not to treat the contract as subsisting.
We must, however, evolve such process which will work.”
(Emphasis supplied)
[See also: Dwarkadas Marfatia & Sons v. Board of Trustees of
the Port of Bombay : (1989) 3 SCC 293 at para 27.]
46. In LIC v. Consumer Education & Research Centre reported in
(1995) 5 SCC 482, the Court held that the law as it stood earlier
that a State or its instrumentality whose action is hedged with public
element cannot be called into question because such action was
in the field of private law is no longer a good law. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“23. Every action of the public authority or the person acting
in public interest or any act that gives rise to public element,
564 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
should be guided by public interest. It is the exercise of
the public power or action hedged with public element
(sic that) becomes open to challenge. If it is shown that
the exercise of the power is arbitrary, unjust and unfair,
it should be no answer for the State, its instrumentality,
public authority or person whose acts have the insignia of
public element to say that their actions are in the field of
private law and they are free to prescribe any conditions
or limitations in their actions as private citizens, simpliciter
do in the field of private law. Its actions must be based
on some rational and relevant principles. It must not be
guided by irrational or irrelevant considerations. Every
administrative decision must be hedged by reasons. [...]
xxx xxx xxx
26. This Court has rejected the contention of an
instrumentality or the State that its action is in the private
law field and would be immuned from satisfying the tests
laid under Article 14. The dichotomy between public law
and private law rights and remedies, though may not be
obliterated by any strait-jacket formula, it would depend
upon the factual matrix. The adjudication of the dispute
arising out of a contract would, therefore, depend upon
facts and circumstances in a given case. The distinction
between public law remedy and private law field cannot
be demarcated with precision. Each case will be examined
on its facts and circumstances to find out the nature of
the activity, scope and nature of the controversy. The
distinction between public law and private law remedy has
now become too thin and practicably obliterated.”
(Emphasis supplied)
47. This Court in Consumer Education & Research Centre (supra)
further held that the writ jurisdiction of the courts cannot be shackled
by technicalities and that any action of the State which has a public
law element or a public character, such actions by their nature are
required to be just, fair, reasonable & in the interest of public, and as
such they would be amenable to judicial review. As to what is meant
by actions bearing insignia of public law element, this Court held that
wherever the action of a State or its instrumentality in the sphere of
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 565
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
contractual relations is enjoined with a duty or an obligation to the
public, such actions could be said to bear the insignia of a public
element. The relevant observation reads as under: -
“27. In the sphere of contractual relations the State, its
instrumentality, public authorities or those whose acts
bear insignia of public element, action to public duty or
obligation are enjoined to act in a manner i.e. fair, just and
equitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options
into consideration and in a manner that is reasonable,
relevant and germane to effectuate the purpose for public
good and in general public interest and it must not take
any irrelevant or irrational factors into consideration or
appear arbitrary in its decision. Duty to act fairly is part of
fair procedure envisaged under Articles 14 and 21. Every
activity of the public authority or those under public duty
or obligation must be informed by reason and guided by
the public interest.
xxx xxx xxx
29. [...] The arms of the High Court are not shackled with
technical rules or procedure. The actions of the State,
its instrumentality, any public authority or person whose
actions bear insignia of public law element or public
character are amenable to judicial review and the validity
of such an action would be tested on the anvil of Article
14. While exercising the power under Article 226 the
Court would be circumspect to adjudicate the disputes
arising out of the contract depending on the facts and
circumstances in a given case. The distinction between
the public law remedy and private law field cannot be
demarcated with precision. Each case has to be examined
on its own facts and circumstances to find out the nature
of the activity or scope and nature of the controversy. The
distinction between public law and private law remedy is
now narrowed down. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
48. In another decision of this Court in Shrilekha Vidyarthi (Kumari) v.
State of U.P. reported in (1991) 1 SCC 212 it was held that every
566 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
action of the State that has some degree of impact on the public
interest, can be challenged under writ jurisdiction to the extent that
they are arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, irrespective of the fact that
the dispute falls within the domain of contractual obligations. It was
further held, that it is the nature of a government body’s personality
which characterizes the action as having a public law element,
and not the field of law where such action is taken. The relevant
observation reads as under: -
“22. There is an obvious difference in the contracts between
private parties and contracts to which the State is a party.
Private parties are concerned only with their personal
interest whereas the State while exercising its powers and
discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as is expected of
it, for public good and in public interest. The impact of every
State action is also on public interest. This factor alone
is sufficient to import at least the minimal requirements
of public law obligations and impress with this character
the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It
is a different matter that the scope of judicial review in
respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual
obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the
parties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights
by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely
contractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is
made on the ground of violation of Article 14 by alleging
that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable,
the fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of
contractual obligations would not relieve the State of its
obligation to comply with the basic requirements of Article
14. To this extent, the obligation is of a public character
invariably in every case irrespective of there being any
other right or obligation in addition thereto. An additional
contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the
guarantee under Article 14 of non-arbitrariness at the
hands of the State in any of its actions.
xxx xxx xxx
24. The State cannot be attributed the split personality
of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the contractual field so as
to impress on it all the characteristics of the State at the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 567
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
threshold while making a contract requiring it to fulfil the
obligation of Article 14 of the Constitution and thereafter
permitting it to cast off its garb of State to adorn the new
robe of a private body during the subsistence of the contract
enabling it to act arbitrarily subject only to the contractual
obligations and remedies flowing from it. It is really the
nature of its personality as State which is significant
and must characterize all its actions, in whatever field,
and not the nature of function, contractual or otherwise,
which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for
examining the validity of its act. The requirement of Article
14 being the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably, there
is nothing which militates against the concept of requiring
the State always to so act, even in contractual matters.
There is a basic difference between the acts of the State
which must invariably be in pubic interest and those of
a private individual, engaged in similar activities, being
primarily for personal gain, which may or may not promote
public interest. Viewed in this manner, in which we find no
conceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find no reason
why the requirement of Article 14 should not extend even
in the sphere of contractual matters for regulating the
conduct of the State activity.

28. Even assuming that it is necessary to import the concept
of presence of some public element in a State action to
attract Article 14 and permit judicial review, we have no
hesitation in saying that the ultimate impact of all actions
of the State or a public body being undoubtedly on public
interest, the requisite public element for this purpose is
present also in contractual matters. We, therefore, find
it difficult and unrealistic to exclude the State actions in
contractual matters, after the contract has been made,
from the purview of judicial review to test its validity on
the anvil of Article 14.”

49. In Verigamto Naveen v. Govt. of A.P. & Ors. reported in (2001) 8
SCC 344 this Court held that where a breach of contract involves
568 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the decision-making authority exceeding its power or violating the
principles of nature justice or its decision being borne out of perversity,
then such cancellation of contract can certainly be scrutinized under
the writ jurisdiction. This is because such an exercise of power by
the authority is apart from the contract. The relevant observation
reads as under: -
“21. [...] Though there is one set of cases rendered by this
Court of the type arising in Radhakrishna Agarwal case
[(1977) 3 SCC 457 : AIR 1977 SC 1496] much water has
flown in the stream of judicial review in contractual field.
In cases where the decision-making authority exceeded its
statutory power or committed breach of rules or principles
of natural justice in exercise of such power or its decision
is perverse or passed an irrational order, this Court has
interceded even after the contract was entered into between
the parties and the Government and its agencies. [...]
Where the breach of contract involves breach of statutory
obligation when the order complained of was made in
exercise of statutory power by a statutory authority, though
cause of action arises out of or pertains to contract,
brings it within the sphere of public law because the
power exercised is apart from contract. The freedom
of the Government to enter into business with anybody
it likes is subject to the condition of reasonableness and
fair play as well as public interest. After entering into a
contract, in cancelling the contract which is subject to
terms of the statutory provisions, as in the present case, it
cannot be said that the matter falls purely in a contractual
field. Therefore, we do not think it would be appropriate to
suggest that the case on hand is a matter arising purely
out of a contract and, therefore, interference under Article
226 of the Constitution is not called for. This contention
also stands rejected.”
(Emphasis supplied)
50. Similarly in Binny Ltd. & Anr. v. Sadasivan & Ors. reported in (2005)
6 SCC 657 this Court in view of the increasing trend of the State
and its instrumentalities to use contracts as a means for dispensing
their regulatory functions, held that whenever a contract is used for
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 569
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
a public purpose, it will be amenable to judicial review. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“30. A contract would not become statutory simply because
it is for construction of a public utility and it has been
awarded by a statutory body. But nevertheless, it may be
noticed that the Government or government authorities at
all levels are increasingly employing contractual techniques
to achieve their regulatory aims. It cannot be said that the
exercise of those powers are free from the zone of judicial
review and that there would be no limits to the exercise
of such powers, but in normal circumstances, judicial
review principles cannot be used to enforce contractual
obligations. When that contractual power is being used
for public purpose, it is certainly amenable to judicial
review. The power must be used for lawful purposes and
not unreasonably.”
(Emphasis supplied)
51. The decision of this Court in ABL International Ltd. v. Export
Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. reported in (2004)
3 SCC 553 is significant and was the turning point in the scope of
judicial review in contractual matters. In this landmark ruling, this
Court decisively laid down and approved that a relief against a State
or its instrumentalities in matters related to contractual obligations
can be sought under the writ jurisdiction. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“23. It is clear from the above observations of this Court,
once the State or an instrumentality of the State is a
party of the contract, it has an obligation in law to act
fairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the
impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the first
respondent as an instrumentality of the State has acted in
contravention of the abovesaid requirement of Article 14,
then we have no hesitation in holding that a writ court can
issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions
of the first respondent.

570 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
27. From the above discussion of ours, the following legal
principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:
(a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a
State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of
a contractual obligation is maintainable.
(b) Merely because some disputed questions of fact
arise for consideration, same cannot be a ground
to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as
a matter of rule.
(c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of
monetary claim is also maintainable.”
(Emphasis supplied)
52. At the same time, this Court in ABL (supra) cautioned that the power
to issue writs under Article 226 being discretionary and plenary,
the same should only be exercised to set right the arbitrary actions
of the State or its instrumentality in matters related to contractual
obligations. The relevant observations read as under: -
“28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the
maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact
that the power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226
of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited
by any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court
having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to
entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The Court has
imposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of
this power. (See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade
Marks) And this plenary right of the High Court to issue a
prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court
to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such
action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and
unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate
of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for
which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said
jurisdiction.”
(Emphasis supplied)
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 571
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
53. In Noble Resources Ltd. v. State of Orissa reported in (2006) 10
SCC 236 this Court for the purposes of judicial review of contractual
disputes recognized a distinction between a matter where the contract
is at the threshold and at the stage of breach. It held that at the
threshold, the court’s scrutiny is more intrusive & expansive while
at the stage of breach it is discretionary except where the action is
found to be arbitrary or unreasonable. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“15. It is trite that if an action on the part of the State is
violative of the equality clause contained in Article 14 of the
Constitution of India, a writ petition would be maintainable
even in the contractual field. A distinction indisputably must
be made between a matter which is at the threshold of a
contract and a breach of contract; whereas in the former
the court’s scrutiny would be more intrusive, in the latter
the court may not ordinarily exercise its discretionary
jurisdiction of judicial review, unless it is found to be
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. While exercising
contractual powers also, the government bodies may be
subjected to judicial review in order to prevent arbitrariness
or favouritism on their part. Indisputably, inherent limitations
exist, but it would not be correct to opine that under no
circumstances a writ will lie only because it involves a
contractual matter.”
(Emphasis supplied)
54. The law on the subject with which we are dealing was laid down
exhaustively by this Court in its decision in Joshi Technologies
International Inc. v. Union of India & Ors. reported in (2015) 7
SCC 728, and the position was summarised as under: -
“69. The position thus summarised in the aforesaid
principles has to be understood in the context of discussion
that preceded which we have pointed out above. As per
this, no doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability
of the writ petition even in contractual matters or where
there are disputed questions of fact or even when monetary
claim is raised. At the same time, discretion lies with the
High Court which under certain circumstances, it can
refuse to exercise. It also follows that under the following
572 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
circumstances, “normally”, the Court would not exercise
such a discretion:
69.1. The Court may not examine the issue unless the
action has some public law character attached to it.
69.2. Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute
is provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to
exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution
and relegate the party to the said mode of settlement,
particularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted
to through the means of arbitration.
69.3. If there are very serious disputed questions of fact
which are of complex nature and require oral evidence
for their determination.
69.4. Money claims per se particularly arising out of
contractual obligations are normally not to be entertained
except in exceptional circumstances.
70. Further, the legal position which emerges from various
judgments of this Court dealing with different situations/
aspects relating to contracts entered into by the State/
public authority with private parties, can be summarised
as under:
70.1. At the stage of entering into a contract, the State
acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the
obligations of fairness.
70.2. State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual
field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practise
some discriminations.
70.3. Even in cases where question is of choice or
consideration of competing claims before entering into
the field of contract, facts have to be investigated and
found before the question of a violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution could arise. If those facts are disputed and
require assessment of evidence the correctness of which
can only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence,
involving examination and cross-examination of witnesses,
the case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 573
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. In
such cases the Court can direct the aggrieved party to
resort to alternate remedy of civil suit, etc.
70.4. Writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226
of the Constitution was not intended to facilitate avoidance
of obligation voluntarily incurred.
70.5. Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid
contractual obligation. Occurrence of commercial difficulty,
inconvenience or hardship in performance of the conditions
agreed to in the contract can provide no justification in
not complying with the terms of contract which the parties
had accepted with open eyes. It cannot ever be that a
licensee can work out the licence if he finds it profitable
to do so: and he can challenge the conditions under which
he agreed to take the licence, if he finds it commercially
inexpedient to conduct his business.
70.6. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained
of, the party complaining of such breach may sue for
specific performance of the contract, if contract is capable
of being specifically performed. Otherwise, the party may
sue for damages.
70.7. Writ can be issued where there is executive action
unsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation
there is denial of equality before law or equal protection of
law or if it can be shown that action of the public authorities
was without giving any hearing and violation of principles
of natural justice after holding that action could not have
been taken without observing principles of natural justice.
70.8. If the contract between private party and the State/
instrumentality and/or agency of the State is under the
realm of a private law and there is no element of public
law, the normal course for the aggrieved party, is to invoke
the remedies provided under ordinary civil law rather
than approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India and invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction.
70.9. The distinction between public law and private law
element in the contract with the State is getting blurred.
574 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
However, it has not been totally obliterated and where
the matter falls purely in private field of contract, this
Court has maintained the position that writ petition is not
maintainable. The dichotomy between public law and
private law rights and remedies would depend on the
factual matrix of each case and the distinction between
the public law remedies and private law field, cannot
be demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has
to be examined, on its facts whether the contractual
relations between the parties bear insignia of public
element. Once on the facts of a particular case it is
found that nature of the activity or controversy involves
public law element, then the matter can be examined
by the High Court in writ petitions under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India to see whether action of the
State and/or instrumentality or agency of the State is
fair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are taken
into consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone
into the decision making process or that the decision is
not arbitrary.
70.10. Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a
citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct
enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due
weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is
how the requirements of due consideration of a legitimate
expectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness.
70.11. The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes
falling within the domain of contractual obligations may
be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be
relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies
provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes.”
(Emphasis supplied)
55. Thereafter, this Court in its decision in M.P. Power Management
Co. Ltd., Jabalpur v. Sky Power Southeast Solar India Pvt.
Ltd. & Ors. reported in (2023) 2 SCC 703 exhaustively delineated
the scope of judicial review of the courts in contractual disputes
concerning public authorities. The aforesaid decision is in the
following parts: -
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 575
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
i. Scope of Judicial Review in matters pertaining to
Contractual Disputes: -
This Court held that the earlier position of law that all rights
against any action of the State in a non-statutory contract would
be governed by the contract alone and thus not amenable to
the writ jurisdiction of the courts is no longer a good law in view
of the subsequent rulings. Although writ jurisdiction is a public
law remedy, yet a relief would still lie under it if it is sought
against an arbitrary action or inaction of the State, even if they
arise from a non-statutory contract. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“53. [...] when the offending party is the State. In
other words, the contention is that the law in this
field has witnessed an evolution and, what is more, a
revolution of sorts and a transformatory change with
a growing realisation of the true ambit of Article 14
of the Constitution of India. The State, he points out,
cannot play the Dr. Jekyll and Hyde game anymore.
Its nature is cast in stone. Its character is inflexible.
This is irrespective of the activity it indulges in. It will
continue to be haunted by the mandate of Article 14
to act fairly. There has been a stunning expansion
of the frontiers of the Court’s jurisdiction to strike at
State action in matters arising out of contract, based,
undoubtedly, on the facts of each case. It remains
open to the Court to refuse to reject a case, involving
State action, on the basis that the action is, per se,
arbitrary.
[...] i. It is, undoubtedly, true that the writ jurisdiction is
a public law remedy. A matter, which lies entirely
within a private realm of affairs of public body,
may not lend itself for being dealt with under
the writ jurisdiction of the Court.
ii. The principle laid down in Bareilly Development
Authority (supra) that in the case of a non
statutory contract the rights are governed only
by the terms of the contract and the decisions,
which are purported to be followed, including
576 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Radhakrishna Agarwal (supra), may not continue
to hold good, in the light of what has been laid
down in ABL (supra) and as followed in the
recent judgment in Sudhir Kumar Singh (supra).
iii. The mere fact that relief is sought under a
contract which is not statutory, will not entitle
the respondent-State in a case by itself to
ward-off scrutiny of its action or inaction under
the contract, if the complaining party is able
to establish that the action/ inaction is, per se,
arbitrary.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction in disputes at the stage prior
to the Award of Contract: -
An action under a writ will lie even at the stage prior to the
award of a contract by the State wherever such award of
contract is imbued with procedural impropriety, arbitrariness,
favouritism or without any application of mind. In doing so, the
courts may set-aside the decision which is found to be vitiated
for the reasons stated above but cannot substitute the same
with its own decision. The relevant observations read as under: -
""iv. An action will lie, undoubtedly, when the
State purports to award any largesse and,
undoubtedly, this relates to the stage prior
to the contract being entered into [See R.D.
Shetty (supra)]. This scrutiny, no doubt, would
be undertaken within the nature of the judicial
review, which has been declared in the decision
in Tata Cellular vs. Union of India.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(iii) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction after the Contract comes into
Existence: -
This court held that even after the contract comes into existence
an action may lie by way of a writ to either (I) obviate an arbitrary
or unreasonable action on part of the State or (II) to call upon
it to honour its obligations unless there is a serious or genuine
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 577
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
dispute as regards the liability of the State from honouring such
obligation. Existence of an alternative remedy or a disputed
question of fact may be a ground to not entertain the parties in
a writ as long as it is not being used as smokescreen to defeat
genuine claims of public law remedy. The relevant observations
read as under: -
""v. After the contract is entered into, there can be
a variety of circumstances, which may provide
a cause of action to a party to the contract with
the State, to seek relief by filing a Writ Petition.
vi. Without intending to be exhaustive, it may
include the relief of seeking payment of amounts
due to the aggrieved party from the State. The
State can, indeed, be called upon to honour its
obligations of making payment, unless it be that
there is a serious and genuine dispute raised
relating to the liability of the State to make the
payment. Such dispute, ordinarily, would include
the contention that the aggrieved party has not
fulfilled its obligations and the Court finds that
such a contention by the State is not a mere
ruse or a pretence.
vii. The existence of an alternate remedy, is,
undoubtedly, a matter to be borne in mind
in declining relief in a Writ Petition in a
contractual matter. Again, the question as to
whether the Writ Petitioner must be told off the
gates, would depend upon the nature of the
claim and relief sought by the petitioner, the
questions, which would have to be decided,
and, most importantly, whether there are
disputed questions of fact, resolution of which
is necessary, as an indispensable prelude to
the grant of the relief sought. Undoubtedly,
while there is no prohibition, in the Writ
Court even deciding disputed particularly
when questions the dispute of fact, surrounds
demystifying of documents only, the Court
578 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
may relegate the party to the remedy by way
of a civil suit.
viii. The existence of a provision for arbitration,
which is a forum intended to quicken the pace
of dispute resolution, is viewed as a near bar to
the entertainment of a Writ Petition (See in this
regard, the view of this Court even in ABL (supra)
explaining how it distinguished the decision of
this Court in State of U.P. and others v. Bridge
& Roof Co., by its observations in paragraph-14
in ABL (supra)].
ix. The need to deal with disputed questions of fact,
cannot be made a smokescreen to guillotine a
genuine claim raised in a Writ Petition, when
actually the resolution of a disputed question
of fact is unnecessary to grant relief to a writ
applicant.
x. The reach of Article 14 enables a Writ Court
to deal with arbitrary State action even after
a contract is entered into by the State. A wide
variety of circumstances can generate causes
of action for invoking Article 14. The Court’s
approach in dealing with the same, would be
guided by, undoubtedly, the overwhelming need
to obviate arbitrary State action, in cases where
the Writ remedy provides an effective and fair
means of preventing miscarriage of justice arising
from palpably unreasonable action by the State.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(iv) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction after Termination or Breach
of the Contract: -
A relief by way of a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution
will also lie against a termination or a breach of a contract,
wherever such action is found to either be palpably unauthorized
or arbitrary. Before turning away the parties to the remedy
of civil suit, the courts must be mindful to see whether such
termination or breach was within the contractual domain or
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 579
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
whether the State was merely purporting to exercise powers
under the contract for any ulterior motive. Any action of the
State to cancel or terminate a contract which is beyond the
terms agreed thereunder will be amenable to the writ jurisdiction
to ascertain if such decision is imbued with arbitrariness or
influenced by any extraneous considerations. The relevant
observations read as under: -
""xi. Termination of contract can again arise in a wide
variety of situations. If for instance, a contract is
terminated, by a person, who is demonstrated,
without any need for any argument, to be
the person, who is completely unauthorised
to cancel the contract, there may not be any
necessity to drive the party to the unnecessary
ordeal of a prolix and avoidable round of
litigation. The intervention by the High Court,
in such a case, where there is no dispute to
be resolved, would also be conducive in public
interest, apart from ensuring the Fundamental
Right of the petitioner under Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. When it comes to a
challenge to the termination of a contract by
the State, which is a non-statutory body, which
is acting in purported exercise of the powers/
rights under such a contract, it would be over
simplifying a complex issue to lay down any
inflexible Rule in favour of the Court turning away
the petitioner to alternate Fora. Ordinarily, the
cases of termination of contract by the State,
acting within its contractual domain, may not
lend itself for appropriate redress by the Writ
Court. This is, undoubtedly, so if the Court is
duty-bound to arrive at findings, which involve
untying knots, which are presented by disputed
questions of facts. Undoubtedly, in view of ABL
Limited (supra), if resolving the dispute, in a
case of repudiation of a contract, involves only
appreciating the true scope of documentary
material in the light of pleadings, the Court
580 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
may still grant relief to an applicant. We must
enter a caveat. The Courts are today reeling
under the weight of a docket explosion, which
is truly alarming. If a case involves a large body
of documents and the Court is called upon to
enter upon findings of facts and involves merely
the construction of the document, it may not be
an unsound discretion to relegate the party to
the alternate remedy. This is not to deprive the
Court of its constitutional power as laid down
in ABL (supra). It all depends upon the facts of
each case as to whether, having regard to the
scope of the dispute to be resolved, whether
the Court will still entertain the petition.
xii. In a case the State is a party to the contract
and a breach of a contract is alleged against
the State, a civil action in the appropriate Forum
is, undoubtedly, maintainable. But this is not the
end of the matter. Having regard to the position
of the State and its duty to act fairly and to
eschew arbitrariness in all its actions, resort to
the constitutional remedy on the cause of action,
that the action is arbitrary, is permissible (See
in this regard Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and
others v. State of U.P. and others). However, it
must be made clear that every case involving
breach of contract by the State, cannot be
dressed up and disguised as a case of arbitrary
State action. While the concept of an arbitrary
action or inaction cannot be cribbed or confined
to any immutable mantra, and must be laid bare,
with reference to the facts of each case, it cannot
be a mere allegation of breach of contract that
would suffice. What must be involved in the case
must be action/inaction, which must be palpably
unreasonable or absolutely irrational and bereft
of any principle. An action, which is completely
malafide, can hardly be described as a fair action
and may, depending on the facts, amount to
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 581
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
arbitrary action. The question must be posed
and answered by the Court and all we intend to
lay down is that there is a discretion available to
the Court to grant relief in appropriate cases.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(v) Other relevant considerations for Exercise of Writ
Jurisdiction: -
Lastly, this Court held that the courts may entertain a contractual
dispute under its writ jurisdiction where (I) there is any violation
of natural justice or (II) where doing so would serve the public
interest or (III) where though the facts are convoluted or
disputed, but the courts have already undertaken an in-depth
scrutiny of the same provided that the it was pursuant to a
sound exercise of its writ jurisdiction. The relevant observations
read as under: -
""xiii. A lodestar, which may illumine the path of
the Court, would be the dimension of public
interest subserved by the Court interfering in
the matter, rather than relegating the matter to
the alternate Forum.
xiv. Another relevant criteria is, if the Court has
entertained the matter, then, while it is not
tabooed that the Court should not relegate the
party at a later stage, ordinarily, it would be a
germane consideration, which may persuade the
Court to complete what it had started, provided
it is otherwise a sound exercise of jurisdiction to
decide the matter on merits in the Writ Petition
itself.
xv. Violation of natural justice has been recognised
as a ground signifying the presence of a public
law element and can found a cause of action
premised on breach of Article 14. [See Sudhir
Kumar Singh and Others (supra)].”
(Emphasis supplied)
56. What can be discerned from the above is that there has been a
considerable shift in the scope of judicial review of the court when it
582 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
comes to contractual disputes where one of the parties is the State
or its instrumentalities. In view of the law laid down by this Court
in ABL (supra), Joshi Technologies (supra) and in M.P. Power
(supra), it is difficult to accept the contention of the respondent that
the writ petition filed by the appellant before the High Court was not
maintainable and the relief prayed for was rightly declined by the
High Court in exercise of its Writ jurisdiction. Where State action is
challenged on the ground of being arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable,
the State would be under an obligation to comply with the basic
requirements of Article 14 of the Constitution and not act in an arbitrary,
unfair and unreasonable manner. This is the constitutional limit of
their authority. There is a jural postulate of good faith in business
relations and undertakings which is given effect to by preventing
arbitrary exercise of powers by the public functionaries in contractual
matters with private individuals. With the rise of the Social Service
State more and more public-private partnerships continue to emerge,
which makes it all the more imperative for the courts to protect the
sanctity of such relations.
57. It is needless to state that in matters concerning specific modalities
of the contract — such as required work, execution methods,
material quality, timeframe, supervision standards, and other
aspects impacting the tender’s purpose — the court usually refrains
from interference. State authorities, like private individuals, have a
consensual element in contract formation. The stipulations or terms
in the underlying contract purpose are part of the consensual aspect,
which need not be entertained by the courts in writ jurisdiction
and the parties may be relegated to ordinary private law remedy.
Judicial review does not extend to fixing contract stipulations but
ensures that the public authorities act within their authority to
prevent arbitrariness.
58. Thus, the demarcation between a private law element and public
law element in the context of contractual disputes if any, may be
assessed by ascertaining whether the dispute or the controversy
pertains to the consensual aspect of the contract or tender in question
or not. Judicial review is permissible to prevent arbitrariness of
public authorities and to ensure that they do not exceed or abuse
their powers in contractual transactions and requires overseeing
the administrative power of public authorities to award or cancel
contracts or any of its stipulations.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 583
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
59. Therefore, what can be culled out from the above is that although
disputes arising purely out of contracts are not amenable to writ
jurisdiction yet keeping in mind the obligation of the State to act fairly
and not arbitrarily or capriciously, it is now well settled that when
contractual power is being used for public purpose, it is certainly
amenable to judicial review.
60. Now coming to the facts of the case at hand, the appellant has
challenged the cancellation of the tender at the instance of the
respondent on the ground of being manifestly arbitrary and influenced
by extraneous considerations. It is evident from the notice of
cancellation dated 07.02.2023, that the tender was not terminated
pursuant to any terms of the contract subsisting between the parties,
rather, the respondent ‘cancelled’ the tender saying that there was
technical fault in the tender that was floated.
61. Thus, the respondent could be said to have exercised powers in its
executive capacity as the action to cancel the tender falls outside
the purview of the terms of the contract. Hence, it cannot be said
that the present matter is purely a contractual dispute. It is also
not a breach of contract, as no such breach has been imputed to
the appellant in terms of the contract, but rather a plain and simple
exercise of the executive powers.
62. Thus, the present dispute even if related to a tender, cannot be termed
as a pure contractual dispute, as the dispute involves a public law
element. Although there is no discharge of a public function by the
respondent towards the appellant yet there is a right to public law
action vested in him against the respondent in terms of Article 14
of the Constitution. This is because the exercise of the executive
power by it in the contractual domain i.e., the cancelling of the
tender carries a corresponding public duty to act in a reasonable
and rationale manner. Thus, we find that the writ petition filed by the
respondent was maintainable and the relief prayed for could have
been considered by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.
c. Meaning and True Import of Arbitrariness of State Actions
in Contractual Disputes.
63. In Ramana Dauaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority
of India & Ors. reported in AIR 1979 SC 1628 this Court held
that the actions of the State in contractual matters must conform
584 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to some standard or norms which is rational, non-discriminatory
and not guided by extraneous considerations, otherwise the same
would be in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“This rule also flows directly from the doctrine of equality
embodied in Article 14. It is now well settled as a result
of the decisions of this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of
Tamil Nadu, A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 555 and Maneka Gandhi v.
Union of India, A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597 that Article 14 strikes
at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and
equality of treatment. It requires that State action must
not be arbitrary but must be based on some rational and
relevant principle which is non discriminatory; it must not
be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant consideration,
because that would be denial of equality. The principle
of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well
as philosophically an essential element of equality or
non-arbitrariness is projected by Article 14 and it must
characterise every State action, whether it be under
authority of law or in exercise of executive power without
making of law. The State cannot, therefore, act arbitrarily
in entering into relationship, contractual or otherwise with
a third party, but its action must conform to some standard
or norm which is rational and non-discriminatory.”
(Emphasis supplied)
64. In Dwarkadas Marfatia & Sons (supra) this Court speaking through
Sabyasachi Mukherji, CJ. (as the learned Chief Justice then was)
held that every action of the State or an instrumentality of the State
must be informed by reason......actions uninformed by reason may be
questioned as arbitrary. The relevant observations read as under: -
“22. [...] every action of the State or as instrumentality of
the State, must be informed by reason. Indubitably, the
respondent is an organ of the State under Article 12 of
the Constitution. In appropriate cases, as was observed in
the last mentioned decision, actions uninformed by reason
may be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under
Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution. But it has to
be remembered that Article 14 cannot be construed as a
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 585
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
charter for judicial review of State action, to call upon the
State to account for its actions in its manifold activities by
stating reasons for such actions.”
(Emphasis supplied)
65. The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily
visualized than precisely stated or defined. The question, whether
an impugned action is arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered
on the facts and in the circumstances of a given case. An obvious
test to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle
emerging from the impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of
reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and
there is no impediment in following that procedure, the performance
of the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any
discernible principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice
of arbitrariness. Every State action must be informed by reason and
it follows that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule of law
contemplates governance by laws and not by humour, whims or
caprices of the men to whom the governance is entrusted for the time
being. It is trite that be you ever so high, the laws are above you.
66. Control of administrative discretion is an important concern in the
development of Rule of Law. According to Wade and Forsyth, the
Rule of Law has four meanings, and one of them is that “government
should be conducted within a framework of recognized rules and
principles which restrict discretionary power”.
67. To enthuse efficiency in administration, a balance between
accountability and autonomy of action should be carefully maintained.
Overemphasis on either would impinge upon public efficiency. But
undermining the accountability would give immunity or carte blanche
power to act as it pleases with the public at whim or vagary. Whether
the public authority acted bona fide would be gauged from the
impugned action and attending circumstances. The authority should
justify the action assailed on the touchstone of justness, fairness and
reasonableness. Test of reasonableness is more strict. The public
authorities should be duty conscious rather than power charged.
Its actions and decisions which touch the common man have to be
tested on the touchstone of fairness and justice. That which is not
fair and just is unreasonable. And what is unreasonable is arbitrary.
An arbitrary action is ultra vires. It does not become bona fide and in
586 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
good faith merely because no personal gain or benefit to the person
exercising discretion has been established. An action is mala fide if it
is contrary to the purpose for which it was authorised to be exercised.
Dishonesty in discharge of duty vitiates the action without anything
more. An action is bad even without proof of motive of dishonesty, if
the authority is found to have acted contrary to reason. [See: Mahesh
Chandra v. Regional Manager, U.P. Financial Corporation & Ors. :
(1993) 2 SCC 279]
68. The dictum as laid in Tata Cellular v. UOI reported in (1994) 6 SCC
651 is that the judicial power of review is exercised to rein in any
unbridled executive functioning. It was observed that the restraint
has two contemporary manifestations viz. one is the ambit of judicial
intervention and the other covers the scope of the court’s ability to
quash an administrative decision on its merits. These restraints bear
the hallmarks of judicial control over administrative action. It was
held that the principle of judicial review is concerned with reviewing
not the merits of the decision in support of which the application for
judicial review is made, but the decision-making process itself. It was
held that the principle of judicial review would apply to the exercise
of contractual powers by the Government bodies in order to prevent
arbitrariness or favouritism. It was held that the duty of the court is
to confine itself to the question of legality and its concern should be
whether a decision-making authority exceeded its powers; whether
it committed an error of law or committed a breach of the rules of
natural justice or reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal
would have reached or, abused its powers. The grounds upon
which an administrative action can be subjected to judicial review
are classified as illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. In
that very decision, while deducing the principles from various cases
referred, it was held that the modern trend points to judicial restraint in
administrative action; that the Court does not sit as a court of appeal
but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made; that
the court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative
decision and if a review of the administrative decision is permitted, it
will be substituting its own decision, without the necessary expertise
which itself may be fallible; that the terms of the invitation to tender
cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is
in the realm of contract; and, that the government must have freedom
of contract, i.e. a free-play in the joints is a necessary concomitant
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 587
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or
quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must not only be
tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness,
but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated
by mala fides. Moreover, quashing decisions may impose heavy
administrative burden on the administration and lead to increased
and unbudgeted expenditure.
69. To ascertain whether an act is arbitrary or not, the court must carefully
attend to the facts and the circumstances of the case. It should find
out whether the impugned decision is based on any principle. If not,
it may unerringly point to arbitrariness. If the act betrays caprice or
the mere exhibition of the whim of the authority it would sufficiently
bear the insignia of arbitrariness. In this regard supporting an order
with a rationale which in the circumstances is found to be reasonable
will go a long way to repel a challenge to State action. No doubt
the reasons need not in every case be part of the order as such.
If there is absence of good faith and the action is actuated with an
oblique motive, it could be characterised as being arbitrary. A total
non-application of mind without due regard to the rights of the parties
and public interest may be a clear indicator of arbitrary action.
70. One another way, to assess whether an action complained of could
be termed as arbitrary is by way of scrutinizing the reasons that have
been assigned to such an action. It involves overseeing whether
the reasons which have been cited if at all genuinely formed part
of the decision-making process or whether they are merely a ruse.
All decisions that are taken must earnestly be in lieu of the reasons
and considerations that have been assigned to it. The Court must be
mindful of the fact that it is not supposed to delve into every minute
details of the reasoning assigned, it need not to go into a detailed
exercise of assessing the pros and cons of the reasons itself, but
should only see whether the reasons were earnest, genuine and
had a rationale with the ultimate decision. What is under scrutiny
in judicial review of an action is the decision-making process and
whether there is any element of arbitrariness or mala fide.
71. Thus, the question to be answered in such situations is whether the
decision was based on valid considerations. This is undertaken to
ensure that the reasons assigned were the true motivations behind
the action and it involves checking for the presence of any ulterior
588 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
motives or irrelevant considerations that might have influenced the
decision. The approach of the court must be to respect the expertise
and discretion of administrative authorities while still protecting against
arbitrary and capricious actions. Thus, now the only question that
remains to be considered is whether the action of the respondent
to cancel the tender could be termed as arbitrary?
ii. Whether the action of cancelling the tender is arbitrary or
unfair and in consequence of violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution?
72. The principal contention of the appellant is that the notice of
cancellation dated 07.02.2023 that was issued by the respondent is
manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable and influenced by mala fide and
extraneous considerations.
73. Before we proceed to determine whether the cancellation of tender
could be termed as arbitrary, it is necessary to understand the stance
of the respondent in the present litigation, as discernible from their
pleadings, which has left us quite perplexed. The argument of the
respondent is two-fold: -
(i) First, that the tender had to be cancelled as there was a
technical fault. The tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ &
‘not well defined’ as a result it created ambiguity resulting in
financial losses to the respondent.
(ii) Secondly, the cancellation was also on account of a change in
policy whereby, the operation & maintenance of the concerned
underpasses had been handed over to another authority.
74. The primary thrust of the respondent’s contention is that the
decision to cancel the tender was taken in view of the technical
faults in the same, more particularly the ambiguity as to whether
the advertisement boards could be put up beyond the area of the
concerned underpasses.
75. The learned Single Judge of the High Court in its order dated
24.04.2023 observed that there was an ambiguity in the Special Terms
& Conditions of the Memorandum of Tender more particularly clauses
10 and 14 respectively which gave rise to a conflicting interpretation
as to the placement of the signboards. This in the opinion of the
High Court was a technical fault, which the respondent sought to
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 589
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
rectify by way of cancelling the tender. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“18. [...] In fact, the letter of cancellation provides further
reasons, namely, that the tender has been found to be
non-specific and having technical faults. This would also
be borne out from clauses 10 and 14 of the Special
Terms and Conditions of the tender document which give
rise to conflicting interpretations on the placement of the
signboards. Hence, besides the administrative decision to
hand over the maintenance of E.M. Bypass from KMDA
to KMC, the respondent KMDA as the tendering authority,
has a right to rectify the ambiguities in the bid document
by cancelling the same.”
(Emphasis supplied)
76. However, interestingly, the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023
that came to be issued by the respondent makes no mention of any
such lacuna. In fact, there is no reference to the aforementioned
clauses or any conflict in their interpretation. The aforesaid notice
only states that the tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ and ‘not
well defined’ which created ambiguity due to which the respondent is
incurring losses, and nothing is stated either about the ambiguity in
putting up the advertisement boards or for that matter which aspect
of the tender is non-specific.
77. It is also apposite to mention that just a month prior to cancelling
the tender, the respondent on 24.01.2023 issued a notice to the
appellant, asking him to stop all work in respect of the tender.
Remarkably, in the said notice, there is no whisper about there
being any of the aforementioned technical faults in the tender floated
by the respondent. In fact, a close reading of the aforesaid notice
would reveal that the orders to stop the work had been issued for
an altogether different reason – i.e., handing over of the operation
& maintenance of the concerned underpasses to another authority
i.e., KMC.
a. Scrutiny of Internal File-Notings and Deliberations of the
State.
78. The appellant has in particular placed reliance on various notings
made in the internal file of the respondent in respect of the tender to
590 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
contend that the cancellation of the same was arbitrary and influenced
by extraneous considerations. The respondent on the other hand
submitted that the internal file-notings cannot be used or relied upon
to impute any ill-motives to the decision of cancelling the tender as
they only reflect the opinion of a particular individual and cannot be
construed or interpreted as the decision of the respondent. In this
regard, reliance has been placed on the following decisions: -
i. Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority
v. Vishnudev Coop. Housing Society : (2018) 8 SCC 215.
ii. Shanti Sports Club v. Union of India : (2009) 15 SCC 705.
79. This Court in its decision in Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab &
Anr. reported in AIR 1963 SC 395 held that merely because something
was written in the internal files and notesheet does not amount to an
order, it at best is an expression of opinion which may be changed,
and it only becomes an order when such opinion is formally made
into a decision. The relevant observations read as under: -
“9. The question, therefore, is whether he did in fact make
such an order. Merely writing something on the file does
not amount to an order. Before something amounts to an
order of the State Government two things are necessary.
The order has to be expressed in the name of the Governor
as required by clause (1) of Article 166 and then it has to
be communicated. As already indicated, no formal order
modifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary was
ever made. Until such an order is drawn up the State
Government cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as bound
by what was stated in the file. [...]
10. The business of State is a complicated one and has
necessarily to be conducted through the agency of a
large number of officials and authorities. The Constitution,
therefore, requires and so did the Rules of Business framed
by the Rajpramukh of PEPSU provide, that the action
must be taken by the authority concerned in the name
of the Rajpramukh. It is not till this formality is observed
that the action can be regarded as that of the State or
here, by the Rajpramukh. [...] Indeed, it is possible that
after expressing one opinion about a particular matter at
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 591
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
a particular stage a Minister or the Council of Ministers
may express quite a different opinion, one which may be
completely opposed to the earlier opinion. Which of them
can be regarded as the “order” of the State Government?
Therefore, to make the opinion amount to a decision of
the Government it must be communicated to the person
concerned.”

Committee, Barwala v. Jai Narayan and Co. & Anr. : (2022) SCC
OnLine 376 at para 16]
80. In Sethi Auto Service Station v. DDA reported in (2009) 1 SCC 180
this Court held that notings in a departmental file are nothing more
than an opinion by an officer for internal use and consideration of
other officials for the final decision making. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“14. It is trite to state that notings in a departmental file
do not have the sanction of law to be an effective order.
A noting by an officer is an expression of his viewpoint on
the subject. It is no more than an opinion by an officer for
internal use and consideration of the other officials of the
department and for the benefit of the final decision-making
authority. Needless to add that internal notings are not
meant for outside exposure. Notings in the file culminate
into an executable order, affecting the rights of the parties,
only when it reaches the final decision-making authority
in the department, gets his approval and the final order
is communicated to the person concerned.”
(Emphasis supplied)
81. In Shanti Sports Club (supra) several representations were made
by the landowners requesting to release their land from acquisition.
After considering those representations, the concerned minister
recorded in the note file that the land should be denotified on suitable
terms and left the final decision to his successor. The new minister,
however, rejected the request for denotification. Consequently, writ
592 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
petitions were filed, seeking the release of the land based on the
note file. This Court held that the notings recorded in the official
files do not become decisions and confer no right unless the same
are sanctified, authenticated and communicated in the prescribed
manner. It further held that any recording in the note-file can always
be reviewed, reversed or overruled. The relevant observations read
as under: -
“43. A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting
simpliciter and nothing more. It merely represents
expression of opinion by the particular individual. By no
stretch of imagination, such noting can be treated as a
decision of the Government. Even if the competent authority
records its opinion in the file on the merits of the matter
under consideration, the same cannot be termed as a
decision of the Government unless it is sanctified and acted
upon by issuing an order in accordance with Articles 77(1)
and (2) or Articles 166(1) and (2). The noting in the file or
even a decision gets culminated into an order affecting
right of the parties only when it is expressed in the name
of the President or the Governor, as the case may be,
and authenticated in the manner provided in Article 77(2)
or Article 166(2). A noting or even a decision recorded
in the file can always be reviewed/reversed/overruled or
overturned and the court cannot take cognizance of the
earlier noting or decision for exercise of the power of
judicial review.
xxx xxx xxx
52. As a result of the above discussion, we hold that the
notings recorded in the official files by the officers of the
Government at different levels and even the Ministers do
not become decisions of the Government unless the same
is sanctified and acted upon by issuing an order in the
name of the President or Governor, as the case may be,
authenticated in the manner provided in Articles 77(2) and
166(2) and is communicated to the affected persons. The
notings and/or decisions recorded in the file do not confer
any right or adversely affect the right of any person and the
same can neither be challenged in a court nor made basis
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 593
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
for seeking relief. Even if the competent authority records
a noting in the file, which indicates that some decision
has been taken by the authority concerned, the same can
always be reviewed by the same authority or reversed or
overturned or overruled by higher functionary/authority in
the Government.”
(Emphasis supplied)
[See also: State of Uttaranchal v. Sunil Kumar Vaish : (2011) 8
SCC 670 at para 24]
82. In Pimpri Chinchwad (supra), a revenue minister passed an order
for deletion of the land of the respondent therein from acquisition
proceeding, but the said order was never communicated, however,
the same was mentioned in the internal note file. Sometime later, the
government decided to reconsider all uncommunicated orders. As
a result the respondents therein filed a writ seeking implementation
of the order as mentioned in the internal note-file. This Court held
that the notings in official files of the government are an internal
matter and carry no legal sanctity unless they are approved and
duly communicated as per the prescribed procedure. It is only when
such notings are translated into formal decisions, they would create
some right or claim in favour of a person. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“36. [...] first, a mere noting in the official files of the
Government while dealing with any matter pertaining
to any person is essentially an internal matter of the
Government and carries with it no legal sanctity; second,
once the decision on such issue is taken and approved by
the competent authority empowered by the Government
in that behalf, it is required to be communicated to the
person concerned by the State Government. In other
words, so long as the decision based on such internal
deliberation is not approved and communicated by the
competent authority as per the procedure prescribed in
that behalf to the person concerned, such noting does
not create any right in favour of the person concerned nor
it partake the nature of any legal order so as to enable
the person concerned to claim any benefit of any such
594 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
internal deliberation. Such noting(s) or/and deliberation(s)
are always capable of being changed or/and amended or/
and withdrawn by the competent authority.”
(Emphasis supplied)
83. We are of the view that the reliance on the part of the respondent
on the decisions of this Court in Pimpri Chinchwad (supra) and
Shanti Sports Club (supra) to assert that no reference could be
made to the internal-file notings for the purposes of judicial review of
its decision is completely misplaced. In Shanti Sports Club (supra)
the question before the Court was as to when an internal noting can
be used to confer or claim a right. Whereas in Pimpri Chinchwad
(supra) the issue for consideration before the Court was whether any
internal-note or deliberation once written in the files was capable of
being reconsidered, changed, modified or withdrawn.
84. None of the aforementioned decisions lay down that the courts are
completely precluded from appraising or scrutinizing the internal
file notings and deliberations for the purposes of judicial review of
a decision. This Court in Pimpri Chinchwad (supra) and Shanti
Sports Club (supra) only went so far as to say that as long as the
deliberations in the internal file notings have not been formalized
into an official decision, the same cannot be relied upon to claim
any right.
85. We are of the considered opinion that once a decision has been
officially made through proper means and channel, any internal
deliberations or file notings that formed a part of that decision-making
process can certainly be looked into by the Court for the purposes
of judicial review in order to satisfy itself of the impeccability of the
said decision.
86. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court
in State of Bihar v. Kripalu Shankar reported in (1987) 3 SCC 34,
wherein it was held that the internal file notings reflect the views
and line of thinking of a particular officer. It further held that such
views would amount to disobedience or contempt of court only when
they are translated into a formal decision. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“11. After this finding, the High Court held some of the
officers of the government guilty solely on the basis of the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 595
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
views expressed by them in the files, which were not, in
fact, accepted by the Government and which were only at
the stage of suggestions and views. Shri K.K. Venugopal,
the learned Counsel for the State contended that it would
be unsafe to initiate action in contempt merely on the
strength or notings by officials on the files, expressing
their views and to do so would imperil the working of
various departments in a Government in a democracy
and would have far-reaching consequences. Sometimes
a view expressed by an officer may be incorrect. The view
so expressed passes through various hands and gets
translated into action only at the ultimate stage. The views
so expressed are only for internal use. Such views may
indicate the line of thinking of a particular officer. Until the
views so expressed culminate into an executable order,
the question of disobedience of court’s order does not
arise. Though the State Government have been found not
guilty, the State has filed the appeal to protect its officers
from independent and fearless expression of opinion and
to see that the order under appeal does not affect the
proper functioning of the Government.”
(Emphasis supplied)
87. The above observations of this Court fortify our view that once a
decision is made, all opinions and deliberations pertaining to the
said decision in the internal file-notings become a part of the process
by which the decision is arrived at, and can be looked into for the
purposes of judicial review. In other words, any internal discussions
or notings that have been approved and formalized into a decision by
an authority can be examined to ascertain the reasons and purposes
behind such decisions for the overall judicial review of such decision-
making process and whether it conforms to the principles enshrined
in Article 14 of the Constitution.
88. One another reason why the respondent cannot claim that its internal
file-notings fall outside the purview of judicial review of the courts
is in view of the inviolable rule that came to be recognized by this
Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra) wherein it was held that
an executive authority must be rigorously held to the standard by
which it professes its actions to be judged. The relevant observations
read as under: -
596 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“10. [...] It is a well-settled rule of administrative law that
an executive authority must be rigorously held to the
standards by which it professes its actions to be judged
and it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain
of invalidation of an act in violation of them. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
89. The aforesaid leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that if the
purported action of cancelling the tender is claimed to have been
taken in view of certain technical faults in the same or even a change
in policy the same ought to be clearly reflected from its internal file
notings as-well, pursuant to which the purported decision was taken.
90. We have gone through the internal file-notings of the respondent on
the aforesaid tender wherein the entire internal deliberations of the
KMDA officials as to the tender for work have been recorded. In the
entire records – right from the time the Notice Inviting Tender was
being formulated till the issuance of the final Notice of Cancellation
dated 07.02.2023, there is no whisper of any particular clauses of
the tender that was floated nor of any conflict or technical fault in
the same, as claimed by the respondent.
91. We are in seisin of the fact that although the internal-file notings
mention about the policy change in the operation and maintenance
of the concerned underpasses, yet a careful reading of the same
reveals that the cancellation of the tender for work was neither due to
any technical fault nor due to the policy change in the operation and
maintenance of the concerned underpasses but was for altogether
a different reason.
92. As per Note #91 dated 30.12.2022 of the file-notings, when the
Order dated 01.12.2022 of the Urban Development and Municipal
Affairs Department came to be passed whereby the maintenance
was handed over to KMC, it was the Minister-In-Charge as the
Chairperson of the respondent authority – who suggested that in view
of the change in scenario the tender be cancelled. In the aforesaid
note, the following has been recorded - “Recently maintenance of
EM Bye pass has been handed over to KMC. Thus, in this changed
scenario we may cancel the work order”.
93. The words “may cancel the work order” clearly indicate, that the
respondent at that stage by no means was of the opinion that the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 597
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
tender was required to be cancelled, as no specific reasons had
been assigned as to what effect the policy change had impacted
the feasibility or practicality of the tender. This is especially because,
none of the officials of the respondent suggested that the tender be
cancelled, rather it was the concerned minister who did so.
94. In Note #95 dated 10.01.2023 it has been clearly recorded by the
officials of the respondent that it was the competent authority of the
KMDA that instructed to cancel the tender in view of the aforesaid
change in the policy. However, since the officials of the respondent
were in doubt regarding the legality of such action, it insisted on first
obtaining the advice or opinion from its legal cell before proceeding
further. Furthermore, the aforesaid note clearly indicates that the
work stop order had to be issued only with a view to comply with
the instructions of the competent authority while it decided upon the
aspect of cancellation of the tender.
95. In Note #97, the respondent has recorded the following – “There is
no different opinion than to get this cancelled, once this has been
decided by the Authority but a legal opinion may be sought for avoiding
further litigations”. This also clearly indicates that as the competent
authority had decided that the tender be cancelled, the officials of the
respondent had no other choice but to cancel the tender. However,
the respondent continued insisting on first obtaining the opinion from
its legal cell before cancelling the same.
96. However, thereafter, as per Note #108 dated 24.01.2023 it is
apparent that the concerned minister during his visit specifically
instructed the officials of the respondent to cancel the tender.
Pursuant to which, the respondent as per Note #109 dated
02.02.2023 immediately convened a meeting to undertake the steps
for cancellation even though the advice from the legal cell had yet
to be obtained. It thereafter prepared a proposal for cancellation,
which culminated into the ultimate notice of cancellation dated
07.02.2023.
97. From the above narrated sequence of events, it is evident that it
was none other but the concerned minister who suggested to cancel
the tender. The respondent was reluctant to immediately cancel the
tender for work and continued to insist on obtaining the opinion from
its legal cell. Even though the opinion of the legal cell was yet to be
obtained, the respondent, despite its initial reluctance, undertook
598 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
immediate steps to cancel the tender after the concerned minister
personally instructed the officials to do so.
98. Thus, it is evident that the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023,
issued to the appellant, was at the behest of the concerned minister.
The respondent clearly recorded that, because instructions for
cancellation had been received from the higher-ups, there was
no option but to proceed with the cancellation. Even before the
respondent could properly and thoroughly explore the possibility
of acceding to such request by consulting its legal cell, the tender
was cancelled only at the instance and specific instructions of the
concerned minister.
99. The aforesaid aspect can be looked at from one another angle. The
concerned Minister-In-Charge had instructed to cancel the tender in
view of the change in policy whereby the operation & maintenance
of the underpasses was vested in another authority. To ascertain
whether the decision of the concerned minister to cancel the tender
was arbitrary or not, we must first consider whether the reason for
such cancellation was genuinely on the basis of the aforesaid change
in policy or whether it was driven by some personal discretion or
motives. This can be discerned by first understanding the change
in policy that took place.
100. The Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department by way
of its Order dated 01.12.2022 decided that the maintenance of the
roads and drainage of the E.M. Bypass shall be handed over by
the respondent to the KMC.
101. As per the Note #91 dated 30.12.2022, the concerned minister
for the first time proposed cancellation of the tender in view of the
aforesaid change in scenario as a result of the maintenance of the
E.M. Bypass being handed over from the respondent to the KMC.
102. However, it is pertinent to note that in the aforesaid order of the
Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department it has
been specifically stated that the right to collect revenue from the
advertisements as-well as the control of the E.M. Bypass shall
continue to remain with the respondent herein.
103. Thus, the respondent at the relevant point of time was not only
in control of the two underpasses, but was also empowered to
continue collecting revenue from the advertisements displayed at
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 599
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
the underpasses. As such the respondent even after the change in
policy, remained well within its rights to continue charging license
fee in lieu of the advertisement rights by way of the aforesaid tender
that was issued to the appellant.
104. When the respondent issued the work stop orders to the appellant
on 24.01.2023 in view of the handing over of the maintenance of the
E.M. Bypass to the KMC, the appellant in response, pointed out that
the work stop orders were completely misconceived as the respondent
continued to retain the custody as-well as the advertisement rights
of the concerned underpasses.
105. It was only after the appellant highlighted why the work stop orders
were misconceived and uncalled for, that the respondent immediately
flipped its stance and in its notice of cancellation that was issued
just 1-month later, it attributed ‘technical faults’ in the tender floated.
106. At the relevant point of time, there could have been no occasion
for the respondent to cancel the tender on the basis of the Urban
Development and Municipal Affairs Department’s order dated
01.12.2022. We say so because:-
(i) First, as per the aforesaid order, it was explicitly clarified
that the respondent would continue to retain the operation
& maintenance as-well as the advertisement rights of the
concerned underpasses.
(ii) Secondly, only the structural maintenance and restoration of the
E.M. Bypass’s carriageway, roads, underground drainage etc.
were to be handed over to the KMC. Indisputably, the tender
that was issued in favour of the appellant was distinct from
the maintenance that was handed over to KMC inasmuch as
the scope of work of tender was limited to cleaning the roads,
walls, floors etc., maintaining the electric-fixtures and upkeep
of the gardens.
(iii) Thirdly, despite the stance of the respondent of “change in
scenario” due to the handing over of the maintenance, we find
that after cancelling the tender and during the pendency of the
present appeal, it was the respondent who floated fresh tender
for the work of maintenance in respect of the same underpasses
and not KMC, thus fortifying our view that the aforesaid change
in policy had no bearing on the cancellation of the tender.
600 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
107. It is only on 16.09.2023 i.e., much after the cancellation of
the tender that the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs
Department, Government of West Bengal modified its earlier order
whereby both, the control along with the right to revenue for the
said structures were handed over to KMC from the respondent.
This leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the concerned
minister’s decision to cancel the tender on account of purported
‘change in policy’ was without any application of mind, capricious
and influenced by malice.
b. Concept of Public Interest in Administrative Decisions.
108. The reluctance on the part of the respondent to cancel the tender
is also evident from Note #97, wherein the authority expressed
its concern over the potential consequences of such cancellation.
The respondent apprehended that in the event the tender for work
was being cancelled, the routine maintenance of the underpasses
would be disrupted. Due to this, the underpasses would have to be
closed until some other agency could take over the maintenance.
The relevant observations read as under: -
“Note # 97
[...] Besides, the underpasses are being maintained by
the bidder. Once the contract is cancel led, the routine
maintenance would be an issue till the work is awarded
thru tender. The E&M Sector may be asked to do the
maintenance by engaging one of the existing agency from
their set up. 0therwise, both the underpasses should be
under the lock and key or police custody.

CE (REBBRDG) (KMDA)”
109. From the above it is evident that the cancellation of the tender was
not in public interest. It may also not be out of place to mention that
as per the internal file-notings the respondent had itself acknowledged
that the revenue model of the aforesaid tender for work was far more
beneficial and was fetching higher rates than the existing models
of other agencies on the E.M. Bypass. The relevant observations
read as under: -
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 601
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
“Note # 88
[...] In this model KMDA is saving Rs. 90.00 Lacs per year
mentioned in Note#49 and earned Rs.62,67,110/- per year
with 5% increment for each year. [...]
So it appears that the rate of this current Revenue model
tender are receiving much higher rate than any hoarding
installed on E.M. Bypass. [...]

[...] The cost of revenue generation would be enhanced at

benefits go in favour of the Authority. [...]

110. Thus, the respondent’s reasoning in the Notice of Cancellation dated
07.02.2023 that it was incurring financial losses from the aforesaid
tender does not hold well either. It has been contended by the
respondent that due to the ambiguity in tender as regards placement
of advertisements, many interested bidders might not have been
able to submit their bids. Thus, the respondent formed the view that
if the ambiguity is corrected a higher license fee could be fetched.
111. However, we are not impressed with the above submission. As
discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, nothing to
this effect is even remotely indicated from the internal file notings of
the respondent or the materials on record. There is nothing to suggest
that there was a technical fault in the tender resulting in financial
losses or that there was a possibility of fetching higher license fees.
On the contrary, it can be seen that the respondent itself was of the
opinion that the tender for work was financially beneficial to it. This
further undermines the claims of technical faults or potential financial
losses, and suggests that the decision to cancel the tender was not
602 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
based on genuine financial concerns but rather on other, possibly
extraneous factors.
112. Even assuming for a moment that there was a technical fault in
the tender, which if rectified had the possibility of generating more
revenue, the same by no stretch could be said to be a cogent reason
for cancelling an already existing tender. In this regard reference
may be made to the decision of this Court in Vice Chariman &
Managing Director, City & Industrial Development Corporation
of Maharashtra Ltd. & Anr. v. Shishir Realty Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.
reported in (2021) SCC OnLine SC 1141 wherein it was held that
mere possibility of more money in public coffers does not in itself
serve ‘public interest’. A blanket claim by the State claiming loss
of public money cannot be used to forgo contractual obligations,
especially when it is not based on any evidence or examination as the
larger interest of upholding contracts is also in the play. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“58. When a contract is being evaluated, the mere
possibility of more money in the public coffers, does not
in itself serve public interest. A blanket claim by the State
claiming loss of public money cannot be used to forgo
contractual obligations, especially when it is not based on
any evidence or examination. The larger public interest of
upholding contracts and the fairness of public authorities is
also in play. Courts need to have a broader understanding
of public interest, while reviewing such contracts.”
(Emphasis supplied)
113. In Vasantkumar Radhakisan Vora (Dead) by His LRs. v. Board
of Trustees of the Port of Bombay, reported in (1991) 1 SCC 761,
this Court held that wherever a public authority seeks to resile or
relive itself from the enforcement of a promise made or obligation
undertaken in the name of public interest, it is legally bound to first
show the material or circumstances by which public interest would be
jeopardised if such enforcement is insisted. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“20. When it seeks to relieve itself from its application the
government or the public authority are bound to place before
the court the material, the circumstances or grounds on
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 603
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
which it seeks to resile from the promise made or obligation
undertaken by insistence of enforcing the promise, how the
public interest would be jeopardised as against the private
interest. It is well settled legal proposition that the private
interest would always yield place to the public interest. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
114. We may again refer to the decision of this Court in M.P. Power
Management Company Ltd. (supra) wherein this Court observed that
merely because the rates embodied in a contract with the passage
of time have become less appealing, the same cannot become a
determinative criterion for either terminating the contract or for the
courts to decline interference in such contractual disputes. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“88. Therefore, on a conspectus of the case law, we find
that the concept of overwhelming public interest has
essentially evolved in the context of cases relating to the
award of contract by the State. It becomes an important
consideration in the question as to whether then the State
with whatever free play it has in its joints decides to award
a contract, to hold up the matter or to interfere with the
same should be accompanied by a careful consideration
of the harm to public interest. We do not go on to say
that consideration of public interest should not at all enter
the mind of the court when it deals with a case involving
repudiation of a claim under a contract or for that matter
in the termination of the contract. However, there is a
qualitative State enters into the contract, rights are created.
If the case is brought to the constitutional court and it is
invited to interfere with State action on the score that its
action is palpably arbitrary, if the action is so found then
an appeal to public interest must be viewed depending
on the facts of each case. If the aspect of public interest
flows entirely on the basis that the rates embodied in the
contract which is arbitrarily terminated has with the passage
of time become less appealing to the State or that because
of the free play of market forces or other developments,
there is a fall in the rate of price of the services or goods
then this cannot become determinative of the question as
604 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to whether court should decline jurisdiction. In this case,
it is noteworthy that the rates were in fact settled on the
basis of international competitive bidding and in which as
many as 182 bidders participated and the rate offered by
the first respondent was undoubtedly the lowest. The fact
that power has become cheaper in the market subsequently
by itself should not result in non-suiting of the complaint
of the first respondent, if it is found that a case of clear
arbitrariness has been established by the first respondent.
89. In other words, public interest cannot also be conflated
with an evaluation of the monetary gain or loss alone.”
(Emphasis supplied)
115. What can be discerned from the above is that this Court has
consistently underscored that any decision to terminate a contract
must be grounded in a real and palpable public interest, duly supported
by cogent materials and circumstances in order to ensure that State
actions are fair, transparent, and accountable. Public interest cannot
be used as a pretext to arbitrarily terminate contracts and there must
be a clear and demonstrable ramification or detriment on the public
interest to justify any such action.
116. Considerations of public interest should not be narrowly confined to
financial aspects. The courts must have a more holistic understanding
of public interest wherever the fairness of public authorities is in
question, giving due regard to the broader implications of such
action on the stability of contractual obligations. Merely because the
financial terms of a contract are less favourable over a period of time
does not justify its termination. Such decisions must be based on a
careful consideration of all relevant factors, including the potential
harm to the integrity and sanctity of contractual relationships. The
larger interest of upholding contracts cannot be discarded in the
name of monetary gain labelled as public interest.
117. We may make a reference to the observations made by this Court
in Har Shankar & Ors. v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr. & Ors.
reported in (1975) 1 SCC 737, wherein this Court held that those
who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of contract
along with its benefit. It further held that the enforcement of rights
and obligations arising out of a contract cannot depend on whether
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 605
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
the contracting party finds it prudent to abide by it. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“16. [...] Those who contract with open eyes must accept the
burdens of the contract along with its benefits. The powers
of the Financial Commissioner to grant liquor licences by
auction and to collect licence fees through the medium of
auctions cannot by writ petitions be questioned by those
who, had their venture succeeded, would have relied upon
those very powers to found a legal claim. Reciprocal rights
and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for
their enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds
it prudent to abide by the terms of the contract. By such a
test no contract could ever have a binding force.”
(Emphasis supplied)
118. Thus, we are of the view that the respondent’s stance of a mere
possibility of fetching higher license fees was no ground to cancel
the tender issued to the appellant for the purposes of rectifying it,
especially when the respondent completely failed to demonstrate
as to how there was a technical fault in the tender or how potential
interested bidders did not participate due to it or how fetching higher
license fees was more than a mere possibility.
119. At this stage, we may also answer one another submission that
was canvassed on behalf of the respondent as regards the other
aspect of public interest besides the monetary gain. It was submitted
on behalf of the respondent that the decision to cancel the tender
was also keeping in mind the considerations such as being able
to engage experts for maintenance of critical public infrastructure.
It is the case of the respondent that the tender was cancelled in
order to float separate tenders, one for the maintenance work and
another for licensing advertisement rights to ensure expertise in
each respective field.
120. We are not impressed by the above submission either. We need not
refer to a copious amount of documents in this regard, as just a bare
perusal of the notice inviting tender shows that the eligibility criterion
for participating in the tender process prescribed a comprehensive
threshold of requirement of experience in structural works and
successful completion of similar natured projects, thus ensuring
606 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the bidders participating in the tender possess the necessary
expertise for the work of maintenance.
121. Even otherwise, if at all the respondent was very much concerned
about the maintenance of the underpasses due to lack of expertise of
the appellant, it was always open to the respondent to terminate the
contract in terms of the termination clause as envisaged in Clause
35 of the Special Terms & Conditions of the Memorandum for the
breach or non-compliance of any of the obligations or terms of the
tender. Mere apprehension of lack of expertise was no ground for the
respondent to cancel the tender by taking recourse to its executive
powers in complete ignorance of the contractual terms that were
agreed upon by them.
122. From the above discussion, we are of the considered opinion that
the present lis is nothing but a classic textbook case of an arbitrary
and capricious exercise of powers by the respondent to cancel the
tender that was issued to the appellant on the basis of extraneous
considerations and at the behest of none other but the concerned
Minister-In-Charge.
II. Sanctity of Public-Private Partnership Tenders
123. Before we close this judgment, we must also address one very
important aspect as regards the importance of maintaining the sanctity
of tenders in public private procurement processes.
124. Public tenders are a cornerstone of governmental procurement
processes, ensuring transparency, competition, and fairness in the
allocation of public resources. It emanates from the Doctrine of Public
Trust which lays down that all natural resources and public use
amenities & structures are intended for the benefit and enjoyment of
the public. The State is not the absolute owner of such resources and
rather owns it in trust and as such it cannot utilize these resources
as it pleases. As a trustee of the public resources, the State owes
i) a duty to ensure that community resources are put to fair and
proper use that enures to the benefit of the public as-well as ii) an
obligation to not indulge in any favouritism or discrimination with
these resources. The State with whatever free play it has in its joints
decides to award a contract, to hold up the matter or to interfere
with the same should be accompanied by a careful consideration
of the harm to public interest.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 607
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
125. Public tenders are designed to provide a level playing field for all
potential bidders, fostering an environment where competition thrives,
and the best value is obtained for public funds. The integrity of this
process ensures that public projects and services are delivered
efficiently and effectively, benefiting society at large. The principles
of transparency and fairness embedded in public tender processes
also help to prevent corruption and misuse of public resources. In
this regard we may refer to the observations made by this Court in
Nagar Nigam v. Al. Farheem Meat Exporters Pvt. Ltd. reported
in (2006) 13 SCC 382, which reads as under: -
“16. The law is well settled that contracts by the State,
its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies must be
normally granted through public auction/public tender by
inviting tenders from eligible persons and the notification of
the public auction or inviting tenders should be advertised
in well-known dailies having wide circulation in the locality
with all relevant details such as date, time and place of
auction, subject-matter of auction, technical specifications,
estimated cost, earnest money deposit, etc. The award
of government contracts through public auction/public
tender is to ensure transparency in the public procurement,
to maximise economy and efficiency in government
procurement, to promote healthy competition among the
tenderers, to provide for fair and equitable treatment of
all tenderers, and to eliminate irregularities, interference
and corrupt practices by the authorities concerned. This
is required by Article 14 of the Constitution.”
(Emphasis supplied)
126. The sanctity of public tenders lies in their role in upholding the
principles of equal opportunity and fairness. Once a contract has come
into existence through a valid tendering process, its termination must
adhere strictly to the terms of the contract, with the executive powers
to be exercised only in exceptional cases by the public authorities and
that too in loathe. The courts are duty bound to zealously protect the
sanctity of any tender that has been duly conducted and concluded
by ensuring that the larger public interest of upholding bindingness
of contracts are not sidelined by a capricious or arbitrary exercise of
power by the State. It is the duty of the courts to interfere in contractual
608 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
matters that have fallen prey to an arbitrary action of the authorities
in the guise of technical faults, policy change or public interest etc.
127. The sanctity of contracts is a fundamental principle that underpins
the stability and predictability of legal and commercial relationships.
When public authorities enter into contracts, they create legitimate
expectations that the State will honour its obligations. Arbitrary or
unreasonable terminations undermine these expectations and erode
the trust of private players from the public procurement processes
and tenders. Once a contract is entered, there is a legitimate
expectation, that the obligations arising from the contract will be
honoured and that the rights arising from it will not be arbitrarily
divested except for a breach or non-compliance of the terms
agreed thereunder. In this regard we may make a reference to
the decision of this Court in Sivanandan C.T. v. High Court of
Kerala reported in (2024) 3 SCC 799 wherein it was held that a
promise made by a public authority will give rise to a legitimate
expectation that it will adhere to its assurances. The relevant
portion reads as under: -
“18. The basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation
in public law is founded on the principles of fairness and
non-arbitrariness in Government dealings with individuals.
It recognises that a public authority’s promise or past
conduct will give rise to a legitimate expectation. The
doctrine is premised on the notion that public authorities,
while performing their public duties, ought to honour
their promises or past practices. The legitimacy of an
expectation can be inferred if it is rooted in law, custom,
or established procedure
xxx xxx xxx
45. The underlying basis for the application of the doctrine
of legitimate expectation has expanded and evolved to
include the principles of good administration. Since citizens
repose their trust in the State, the actions and policies of
the State give rise to legitimate expectations that the State
will adhere to its assurance or past practice by acting in
a consistent, transparent, and predictable manner. The
principles of good administration require that the decisions
of public authorities must withstand the test of consistency,
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 609
Subodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.
transparency, and predictability to avoid being regarded as
arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14.”
(Emphasis supplied)
128. Cancellation of a contract deprives a person of his very valuable rights
and is a very drastic step, often due to significant investments having
already been made by the parties involved during the subsistence
of the contract. Failure on the part of the courts to zealously protect
the binding nature of a lawful and valid tender, would erode public
faith in contracts and tenders. Arbitrary terminations of contract
create uncertainty and unpredictability, thereby discouraging public
participation in the tendering process. When private parties perceive
that their contractual rights can be easily trampled by the State, they
would be dissuaded from participating in public procurement processes
which may have a negative impact on such other public-private
partnership ventures and ultimately it is the public who would have
to bear the brunt thereby frustrating the very object of public interest.
129. We caution the public authorities to be circumspect in disturbing or
wriggling out of its contractual obligations through means beyond the
terms of the contract in exercise of their executive powers. We do
not say for a moment that the State has no power to alter or cancel
a contract that it has entered into. However, if the State deems it
necessary to alter or cancel a contract on the ground of public interest
or change in policy then such considerations must be bona-fide and
should be earnestly reflected in the decision-making process and also
in the final decision itself. We say so because otherwise, it would have
a very chilling effect as participating and winning a tender would tend
to be viewed as a situation worse than losing one at the threshold.
H. FINAL CONCLUSION
130. We are of the considered opinion that the litigation at hand is nothing
but a classic textbook case of an arbitrary exercise of powers by
the respondent in cancelling the tender that was issued in favour
of the appellant and that too at the behest of none other than the
concerned Minister-In-Charge and thereby rendering the Notice of
Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 illegal.
131. During the course of hearing, we were informed that the appellant
herein pursuant to the terms of the subject tender had erected
multiple structures at different sites on the concerned underpasses
610 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
for displaying advertisements at a huge personal cost. He has made
significant investments pursuant to the tender.
132. As, we have held the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 to be
non-est, the issuance of a fresh tender to any third-party in respect
of the same work would not defeat the vested rights that accrued in
favour of the appellant. Similarly, the handing over of the operation
and maintenance of the E.M. Bypass to the KMC also would have no
bearing whatsoever, on the rights that stood vested in the appellant
as on the date of cancellation of the tender. Such vested rights would
continue to operate notwithstanding any change in the control and
maintenance of the underpasses.
133. The order dated 16.09.2023 passed by the Urban Development and
Municipal Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal merely
transferred the operation and maintenance of the underpasses
including the right to receive revenue from KMDA to KMC and
therefore will have no effect on any rights that accrued in favour
of the appellant as such rights are independent of the authority in
control of operations and maintenance.
134. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds and is
hereby allowed. The notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 is
quashed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High
Court is hereby set aside.
135. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

1. Leave granted.
2. The Appellant – Level 9 BIZ Pvt. Ltd., who was not a party to the
proceedings, being Civil Writ Petition No. 1481 of 2021, filed by
the Respondent No.2 – M/s. Vasu Constructions in the High Court
of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla, has challenged the impugned
order dated 18.10.2022 passed by the High Court in the said
proceedings. The High Court passed the impugned order disposing
of the said CWP by merely accepting the statement made on behalf
of the Respondent No.1 – Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban
Development Authority (HIMUDA) that it wanted to withdraw the
cancellation of initial tendering process order dated 05.02.2021,
and the statement made on behalf of the Respondent No. 2 that it
was ready to execute the project on the same terms and conditions
and the rates as per the initial tender dated 15.11.2018, though
the said tender was already withdrawn by the Respondent no. 1
HIMUDA in view of the irregularities and illegalities committed by it,
as recorded by an independent committee appointed by the High
Court in earlier writ petitions filed by the present appellant and one
Dalip S. Rathore.

3. The broad facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated
as under: -
DATES EVENTS
15/16.11.2018 Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) was issued by
HIMUDA (R-1) for the construction of proposed
commercial complex of Vikas Nagar, Shimla, at
estimated cost of Rs.45,05,62,074/-
15.12.2018 Technical Bids were opened and on the same
day Financial Bids were also opened. (Appellant
& R-2 were the only found to be qualified – But
the Appellant was L2)
17.12.2018 LOI was issued by the R-1 in favour of R-2.
24.12.2018 One Unsuccessful bidder Dalip S Rathore
filed Writ Petition being CWP 3021 of 2018
challenging the technical specifications &
ineligibility of Respondent No.2, also seeking
cancellation of the Tender. The High Court
issued notice.
02.01.2019 R-1 HIMUDA withdrew the LOI dated 17.12.2018
of R-2 M/S Vasu Constructions stating that the
case is pending in the High Court and the work
will be awarded only as per the decision of the
High Court.
05.01.2019 R-1 HIMUDA constituted a committee, which
reviewed the tender process and concluded that
there were many lapses which warranted actions
against the erring officials.
07.01.2019 Another Committee constituted by R-1
submitted a report that Shri Dalip Singh was
not qualified and M/s. Vasu Constructions was
qualified.
23.02.2019 Appellant – Level 9 BIZ Pvt. Ltd. filed a writ
petition CWP 363 of 2019, praying for rejection
of Technical Bid and Financial Bid of the R-2 M/s.
Vasu Constructions
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 5
Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban
Development Authority & Another
25.11.2020 High Court passed a detailed order on 25.11.2020
in CWP No. 3021/2018 and 363/2019.
In Para 29 High Court observed-
“[..] this Court is prima facie of the
view that some of the officers manning
high positions in HIMUDA have not
acted responsibly and in the interest
of organization, rather have attempted,
directly or indirectly, to give undue
benefit to some of the contractors.
Having seen the record, this Court is
compelled to draw a conclusion that the
officers responsible for evaluation of the
tender in question, did not scrutinize the
documents submitted by the tenderers
along with their bids properly and, with
a view to ensure ouster of some eligible
contractors and awarding the same to
their favourites, have made an attempt
to justify their action by giving totally
implausible reasoning.”
In para 31, High Court observed-
“But, for the reasons, best known
to the authority, it still proceeded to
award the tender in favour of M/s. Vasu
Construction Company.”
The High Court therefore to instill confidence in
the general public and to ensure transparency in
the system, constituted an independent committee
to enquire into the tender process in question, and
directed the committee to submit its report in a
sealed cover to the Court.
02.01.2021 Committee constituted by High Court filed its report.
08.01.2021 High Court disposed of both Petitions being Nos.
3021/2018 and 363/19 and directed registry
to initiate separate proceedings against erring
officials, observing as under: -
6 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
14. Since the committee, after having
perused the records, has arrived at
a definite conclusion that on account
of shortcomings/irregularities, tender
in question requires to be cancelled,
nothing much is left for this court to
adjudicate in these matters. Leaving
everything aside, learned counsel for the
petitioners in both the petitions, being
satisfied with the findings of enquiry
committee as well as suggestions made
therein, are not willing to prosecute
the cases further and have prayed to
dispose of the same as having been
rendered infructuous.
15. In view of aforesaid, both the
petitions are disposed of as infructuous
alongwith all pending applications.
Interim directions, if any, stand vacated.
However, liberty is reserved to the
parties to file fresh petition(s), if any, if
they still remain aggrieved.
16. However, this court, having taken
note of the fact that the enquiry committee
despite having found officers lacking in
discharge of their duties, has failed
to fix responsibility and recommend
action, criminal or departmental, deems
it necessary to direct the Registry
of this Court to register separate
proceedings, enabling this Court to pass
appropriate orders so as to ensure strict
compliance of recommendations given
in the report of enquiry committee and
pass appropriate orders with regard
to initiation of criminal/ departmental
proceedings against the erring officials.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 7
Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban
Development Authority & Another
Registry is directed to register separate
proceedings and list the same on
17.3.2021. The order dated 25.9.2020,
this judgment and the enquiry report
submitted by the committee constituted
by this Court, shall form part of the fresh
proceedings.
05.02.2021 Respondent No.1 cancelled the Tender in view
of the Order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the
High Court.
03.03.2021 Respondent No.2 filed a new Writ Petition against
Respondent No.1, i.e., CWP 1481 of 2021
challenging order dated 05.02.2021.
Respondent no. 2 also filed separate two LPAs
being LPA No. 6/2021 and 12/2021 against the
common order dated 08.01.2021 passed in CWP
No. 3021/2018 and CWP No. 363/2019 by the
Single Bench.
17.11.2021 R-1 HIMUDA issued fresh NIT for the same work.
01.12.2021 The Division Bench of High Court passed an
interim order in LPA No. 6/2021, 12/2021 and CWP
No. 1481/2021 staying the NIT dated 17.11.2021
till further orders.
18.10.2022 The Division Bench disposed of the Writ Petition
No. 1481/2021 upon statement of the Executive
Engineer of Respondent No.1 observing as under:
7. Learned counsel for the respondent on
instructions of Mr. Rajesh Thakur, Executive
Engineer, HIMUDA, Division, Shimla-9, has
submitted that the competent authority wants
to withdraw the cancellation of initial tendering
process order dated 5th February, 2021, bearing
No. 5806-11, as the public is deprived from the
facilities, which would have been available to them
after completion of the project. The project cost is
going to be enhanced due to delay in execution
of the project, which will cause additional burden
8 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
on the public exchequer. The various Government
departments/PSUs are facing acute shortage of
office accommodation, therefore, in larger public
interest, the authority has no objection to go ahead
with initial tendering process, in case the petitioner
is ready to execute the work at the same rate and
terms and conditions as were agreed at the time
of finalization of the initial NIT dated 15.11.2018
(Annexure P-2). The time period for execution
of work will start from date of fresh award letter
which will be issued in favour of the petitioner
within 15 days.
8.Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner, on
instructions from the petitioner, has submitted
that offer made by the respondent is acceptable
to the petitioner and petitioner is ready to execute
the project on the same terms and conditions
and rates as per initial tender dated 15.11.2018
(Annexure P-2).
Nov. 2022 Contract Agreement was signed between
Respondent 1 & 2. Work started.
12.12.2022 The Appellant filed the SLP challenging the
impugned order dated 18.10.2022 and the Court
while issuing notice, granted stay of operation of
the impugned order dated 18.10.2022.
4. The question that has been posed before us in the instant appeal
is, whether the High Court could have disposed of the CWP filed
by the respondent no. 2 by simply accepting the statements
made on behalf of the learned advocates for the respondent no.
1 and respondent no. 2, virtually permitting the respondent no.1
HIMUDA to withdraw the cancellation of initial tendering process
order dated 05.02.2021 and permitting the respondent no. 2 M/s
Vasu Constructions to execute the project on the same terms
and conditions and at the rates as per the initial tender dated
15.11.2018, though the said tender was already withdrawn by
the Respondent No.1 HIMUDA in view of the report made by the
independent Committee constituted by the High Court confirming
gross irregularities and illegalities committed by the officers of
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 9
Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban
Development Authority & Another
HIMUDA and in view of the order dated 08.01.2021 passed by
the Single Bench?
5. As could be seen from the chronology of events, the appellant and
the respondent No. 2 were declared qualified in the Technical Bids
opened on 15.12.2018 and on the same day, the financial bid of the
said two parties were also opened. The respondent no.2 being L-1,
the Letter of Intent dated 17.12.2018 was issued by the Respondent
No.1 in favour of the respondent no.2. Subsequently, an unsuccessful
bidder M/s Dalip Singh Rathore filed a writ petition being No.
3021/2018 in the High Court, alleging irregularities and illegalities in
the tender process and challenging the eligibility of the respondent
no. 2, also seeking cancellation of the Tender. The appellant also
filed CWP No. 363/2019 praying for the rejection of the Technical
and Financial Bids of the respondent no.2. The respondent no.1
HIMUDA in the meantime appointed a committee on 01.01.2019 to
review the tender process. The respondent no.1 also vide the letter
dated 02.01.2019 withdrew the Letter of Intent issued in favour of
the respondent no.2. Subsequently, the High Court also appointed
an Independent Committee to look into the alleged illegalities and
irregularities vide the order dated 25.11.2020, in order to instill
confidence in the general public and to ensure transparency in the
system.
6. As transpiring from the order dated 08.01.2021, the said Independent
Committee submitted the report, arriving at a definite conclusion that
the officers responsible for evaluation of the tender had not acted
responsibly and fairly, as a consequence of which both M/s Vasu
Constructions Company (respondent no.2 herein) and M/s Level 9
Biz Pvt. Ltd. (the appellant herein) were wrongly declared eligible in
the Technical Bid. The Committee had concluded that since both the
bidders were not technically qualified as per the terms and conditions
of the NIT, the tender needed to be cancelled. The recommendations
made by the said Committee, except the recommendation for deletion
of condition with regard to NPA, were stated to have been accepted
by the Enquiry Committee of the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA. The High
Court recorded the statements of the concerned counsels for the
parties and disposed of the petitions being CWP Nos. 3021/2018 and
363/2019 vide Order dated 08.01.2021 observing that the petitions
had been rendered infructuous, however reserved a liberty for the
parties to file fresh petition(s), if any, if they still remained aggrieved.
10 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
7. Subsequently, the respondent no.1 HIMUDA cancelled the tender
on 05.02.2021 in view of the said order dated 08.01.2021 passed
by the High Court. The said action of the respondent no.1 came to
be challenged by the Respondent No.2 M/s Vasu Constructions by
filing a petition being CWP No. 1481/2021. The respondent no. 2
also filed two LPAs being 6/2021 and 12/2021 being aggrieved by
the common Order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the Single Bench.
The Division Bench of the High Court disposed of the CWP No.
1481/2021 vide the impugned order dated 18.10.2022 accepting the
statements made by the learned counsels for the respondent nos.
1 and 2 as stated hereinabove.
8. We are at loss to understand as to how the said petition filed by
the respondent no.2 could have been disposed of by the Division
Bench by merely recording and accepting the statements of the
learned counsels for the respondent nos. 1 and 2, when the tender
in respect of NIT dated 15.11.2018 was cancelled by the respondent
no.1 HIMUDA on account of the gross irregularities and illegalities in
the tender process found by the Independent Committee constituted
by the High Court and on account of the order passed by the High
Court on 08.01.2021? We are also at loss to understand as to how
the Executive Engineer of HIMUDA, could have made the statements
before the Division Bench that the competent authority of the
respondent no.1 wanted to withdraw the cancellation of the initial
tendering process order dated 05.02.2021 and that the respondent
no. 1 had no objection to go ahead with the initial tendering process,
in case the respondent no.2 was ready to execute the work on
the same terms and conditions as were agreed at the time of
finalization of NIT dated 15.11.2018, when the respondent no. 1
itself had decided to cancel and in fact cancelled the initial tendering
process vide its order dated 05.02.2021 accepting the findings of
the committee constituted by the High Court to the effect that there
were irregularities and illegalities committed by the officers of the
HIMUDA in processing the tender and that the respondent no. 2 was
not technically qualified?
9. When the common order dated 08.01.2021 was passed in the Writ
Petition No. 3021 of 2018 filed by the petitioner Dalip Singh and Writ
Petition No.363 of 2019 filed by the present appellant, recording the
said findings of the committee appointed by it, pursuant to which
order, the respondent no.1 had cancelled the tender on 05.02.2021,
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 11
Level 9 Biz Pvt. Ltd. v. Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban
Development Authority & Another
and had issued a fresh NIT on 17.11.2021, it was incumbent on the
part of the respondent no. 2 to implead the said two petitioners as
the party respondents in the new petition filed by it i.e. 1481/2021,
and it was also incumbent on the part of the High Court to give
opportunity of hearing to the said petitioners before passing the
impugned order disposing of the said petition merely recording the
statements of the learned counsels for the respondent nos. 1 and
2, and permitting the respondent nos. 1 and 2 to go ahead with
execution of the work as per the initial tender which was already
cancelled by the respondent no.1.
10. Though it is true that initially an LOI was issued by the respondent
no. 1 in favour of the respondent no. 2 on 17.12.2018, but the same
was withdrawn by the respondent no. 1 as per the letter dated
02.01.2019 on account of pending litigations in the High Court. In
any case, it hardly needs to be reiterated that the Letter of Intent is
merely an expression of intention to enter into a contract. It does not
create any right in favour of the party to whom it is issued. There
is no binding legal relationship between the party issuing the LOI
and the party to whom such LOI is issued. A detailed agreement/
contract is required to be drawn up between the parties after the LOI
is received by the other party more particularly in case of contract
of such a mega scale.
11. Since, there was no right whatsoever created in favour of the
respondent no. 2, and since the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA had
already accepted the recommendations of the Committee appointed
by the High Court and the order dated 08.01.2021 passed by the
High Court, and had cancelled the tender and issued fresh NIT on
17.11.2021, the respondent no. 1 could not have agreed to allow the
respondent no. 2, who was found to be not technically qualified, to
go ahead with the execution of the project in question and that too
without giving the other two parties any opportunity to negotiate. If the
respondent no. 1 was so keen to provide the facilities to the public
without causing any additional burden on the public exchequer, all
the three parties who had participated in the original tender should
have been given the opportunity to negotiate with it.
12. Having regard to the entire chain of events, and the conduct of
the respondent nos. 1 and 2, we have no hesitation in holding that
the respondent no. 1 in collusion with the respondent no. 2, had
12 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
taken the High Court for a ride and misused the process of law for
covering up the irregularities and illegalities committed in the tender
process by the officers of the respondent no. 1, and for anyhow
awarding the contract to the respondent no. 2 under the guise of
the court’s order. It is a matter of surprise for us that the High Court
also could not notice the ill-intention of the respondent nos. 1 and 2
and disposed of the petition, permitting them to go ahead with the
original tender, ignoring the reports of the independent committee
and the observations made by the Single Bench in the Order dated
08.01.2021 with regard to the irregularities and illegalities committed
by the officers of the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA.
13. The impugned order having been passed without proper application of
mind and without assigning any cogent reason for brushing aside the
findings recorded by the Independent Committee and the observations
made by the Single Bench in the order dated 08.01.2021, the same
deserves to be quashed and set aside. Since, we have found that
the respondent no.1 HIMUDA, though ‘State’ within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, had acted malafide and in
collusion with the respondent no.2, and had taken the High Court for
a ride, the present appeal deserves to be allowed with heavy cost.
14. In that view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the High
Court is set aside. The appeal is allowed with cost of Rs. 5,00,000/-
to be deposited by the respondent no. 1 HIMUDA with the Supreme
Court Advocates-on-Record Association, within two weeks from today.
However, it is clarified that the respondent no.1 shall be at liberty
to initiate a fresh tender process in accordance with law and after
following the due process of law.

","Order
Surya Kant, J.
There are approximately [35] state-aided Universities in the State
of West Bengal. The appointment of their Vice-Chancellors is the
hallmark of this controversy. It seems that the Petitioner-State of
West Bengal appointed 24 Vice-Chancellors in the year 2022.
These appointments, along with the West Bengal University Laws
(Amendment) Act, 2012 and the West Bengal Laws (Amendment)
Act, 2014, were challenged before the High Court in a Public Interest
Litigation. The High Court vide judgement dated 14.03.2023 held
that the Search Committee constituted by the State Government
for the selection of those 24 Vice-Chancellors did not have any
Member nominated by the Chairman of the University Grants
Commission (UGC) and since the said Search Committee was in
violation of the UGC’s Act, the appointment of 24 Vice-Chancellors
72 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
was unsustainable in law. The Division Bench judgment was upheld
by this Court.
2. It further seems that the State of West Bengal thereafter made certain
amendments in the State Universities Act in tune with the UGC’s
Regulations, 2018. However, instead of resorting to the statutorily
prescribed procedure for appointment of regular Vice-Chancellors,
the Minister-in-charge of the Department of Higher Education,
Government of West Bengal, sent a proposal on 18.05.2023 to the
Chancellor for extending the tenure of 27 Vice-Chancellors whose
tenure was about to expire. The Chancellor, on the other hand,
appointed ‘Interim Vice-Chancellors’ and as many as 28 professors
were given such assignments. The appointments of these interim/ad-
hoc/caretaker Vice-Chancellors came to be challenged by Respondent
No. 1 through a Public Interest Litigation, which the High Court not
only dismissed vide impugned judgment dated 28-06-2023 but also
conferred perks and other monetary benefits on its own to these
acting Vice-Chancellors, a benefit which the Chancellor himself had
not granted to them.
3. The Division Bench order, to the extent of granting pay, allowance,
perks or facilities admissible to a regular Vice-Chancellor, was
consequently stayed by this Court vide order dated 06.10.2023.
4. The rift between the State Government, on the one hand, and the
Governor of West Bengal, who happens to be the Chancellor of
subject Universities, on the other, is the root cause of stalemate in the
appointment of regular Vice-Chancellors. To elaborate further, there
is no consensus between the two sets of authorities in the matter of
constitution and composition of Search Committees for shortlisting
the candidates for appointment as Vice Chancellors.
5. Since we, prima facie, disapproved the Chancellor’s action of
appointing interim Vice-Chancellors without consulting the State
Government, all such further appointments were stayed vide order
dated 06.10.2023.
6. The chaos has further deepened as neither there are regular Vice-
Chancellors nor interim or ad-hoc Vice-Chancellors are permitted to
be appointed. Regardless thereto, the Chancellor has assigned the
powers of Vice-Chancellors to various persons — not necessarily all
of them are academicians. The State of West Bengal has strongly
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 73
The State of West Bengal v. Dr. Sanat Kumar Ghosh and Ors.
protested against such a recourse. We, however, do not deem it
necessary to dwell on that issue at this stage for the reasons stated
hereinafter:
(I) On 15-09-2023, the learned Senior Counsel for the State of
West Bengal, as well as learned counsel for the Chancellor,
very fairly suggested that, pending multiple controversies, the
Search Committee may be constituted by this Court. In order
to explore that possibility, this Court on 27.09.2023 directed the
learned senior counsel/counsel for the parties to submit, in a
tabulated chart, the details of the Universities, the description
of their subjects/disciplines, existing provisions for constitution
of Search Committees, as well as the new provision which
the State of West Bengal had proposed in the Bill awaiting
assent of the Governor. Counsel for the intervenors were also
granted liberty to suggest the names of renowned scientists,
technocrats, administrators, educationists, jurists or any other
eminent person for the purpose of nomination to the Search
Committee.
(II) On 06.10.2023, the parties sought time to replace certain
names earlier suggested by them for nomination to the Search
Committees.
(III) On 20.11.2023, learned senior counsel for the parties agreed
to submit a consolidated list of the names proposed by the
State Government/Chief Minister/Chancellor/UGC and other
prescribed authorities for the purpose of constituting Search
Committees.
(IV) On 01.12.2023, learned Attorney General for India entered
appearance on behalf of the Chancellor. He assured that the
names to be suggested by the Chancellor for the constitution
of Search Committees will be shared with counsels for the
petitioner/intervenors. Besides granting time in this regard, we
also impressed upon the learned Attorney General to use his
good offices to explore an amicable mode of appointment of
the Vice-Chancellors, in conformity with the Statutes governing
such appointments.
(V) It seems that pursuant to the initiative taken by learned Attorney
General, some meetings were held on 04.12.2023, 13.03.2024
74 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and 14.03.2024. These meetings, however, did not yield the
desired results.
(VI) On 16.04.2024, learned Attorney General, however, very fairly
stated that six posts of the Vice-Chancellors will be filled up out
of the list recommended by the State Government. Eventually,
on 17.05.2024, we were informed that the State Government
had sent a list of 15 names for appointment of Vice-Chancellors
in 15 Universities. The learned Chancellor found 07 of them
unsuitable and apparently had no objection against the remaining
08 persons. We, therefore, directed that those 08 names be
appointed within 10 days. In order to instill confidence on both
sides, it was observed that the Chief Minister of the State may
send names of some more eminent persons to fill up the 07
vacancies of Vice-Chancellors.
(VII) We have no reason to doubt that the Chief Minister must
have sent a few more names of eminent personalities and
the Chancellor hopefully has accorded his approval for their
appointment. As regard to the left-out Universities, we agreed
on 17.05.2024, on the joint request of learned senior counsel
for the parties, that a Search-cum-Selection Committee shall
be constituted by this Court before the next date of hearing.
7. This is how we are tasked to constitute the Search-cum-Selection
Committees.
8. Learned senior counsel/counsel for the parties are ad idem
that the appointment of Vice-Chancellors in all the Universities
are regulated by different Statutes. The academic qualification,
teaching experience, and some other distinct features also vary
from university to university, depending upon the speciality of the
subjects being taught thereby. The (i) names of the University
Acts; (ii) existing provision for appointment of Vice-Chancellors;
(iii) amended provision for appointment of Vice-Chancellor under
the ordinance of 2023; and (iv) subjects/disciplines which are being
taught in a University, have been consequently provided to us in
a tabulated form. On a cursory look, we find that every statute,
broadly speaking, provides that the Vice-Chancellor shall be
appointed by the Chancellor on the recommendations of a Search-
cum-Selection Committee, who shall hold the office upto the age
of 65 years and should be a person possessing the highest level
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 75
The State of West Bengal v. Dr. Sanat Kumar Ghosh and Ors.
of competence, integrity, morals and institutional commitment. The
Vice-Chancellor must also be a distinguished academician with 10
years of experience as a Professor in a University or a well-reputed
research/academician organization.
9. On an illustrative basis, we deem it appropriate in this regard to
reproduce Section 8 of the Calcutta University Act, 1979, which
reads as follows:
“8. (1) The Vice-Chancellor shall be appointed by
the Chancellor on the unanimous recommendation
of the Senate. If the Senate fails to make any such
recommendation, the Vice-Chancellor shall be appointed
by the Chancellor in consultation with the Minister from
a panel of three persons to be elected by the Senate in
accordance with the system of proportional representation
by means of the single transferable vote.
(2) (a) The Vice-Chancellor shall hold office for a period of
four years or till he attains the age of 65 years, whichever
is earlier, and shall, subject to the provisions of this section,
be eligible for re-appointment for a period not exceeding
four years.
(b) The Chancellor may, notwithstanding the expiration of
the term of the office of the Vice-Chancellor or his attaining
the age of 65 years, allow him to continue in office till
a successor assumes office, provided that he shall not
continue as such for any period exceeding one year.
(3) The Vice-Chancellor shall be a whole-time officer
of the University and shall be paid from the University
Fund a salary of three thousand and five hundred rupees
per month and such allowances as the Chancellor may
decide.
(4) The Vice-Chancellor may resign his office by writing
under his hand addressed to the Chancellor.
(5) If—
(a) the Vice-Chancellor is, by reason of leave, illness or
other cause, temporarily unable to exercise the powers
and perform the duties of his office, or
76 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(b) a vacancy occurs in the office of the Vice-Chancellor
by reason of death, resignation or expiry of the term of
his office, removal or otherwise,
then, during the period of such temporary inability or
pending the appointment of a Vice-Chancellor, as the case
may be, the Pro-Vice- Chancellor for Academic Affairs
shall exercise the powers and perform the duties of the
Vice-Chancellor.
(6) The vacancy in the office of the Vice-Chancellor
occurring by reason of death, resignation or expiry of the
term of his office, removal or otherwise shall be filled up by
appointment of a Vice-Chancellor in accordance with the
provisions of sub-section (1) within a period of six months
from the date of occurrence of the vacancy.”
10. We may hasten to add at this stage that notwithstanding some
variance in the provisions of the Acts under which Vice-Chancellors
are to be appointed, especially with regard to composition of
the Search-cum-Selection Committee, we deem it appropriate
to invoke our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to do
complete justice in this matter and pass this common order for
constitution of Search-cum-Selection Committee for all the subject
Universities. Hence, we resolve to constitute Search-cum-Selection
Committee(s) of the same composition so as to avoid any confusion,
irrespective of the fact that the relevant provision of the Statute
of the concerned University may contain slight variations. Our
endeavour is to infuse transparency, independence, fairness, and
impartiality so as to ensure that the persons possessing the highest
level of competence and integrity and are capable of leading the
University by example are shortlisted. In this regard, we have
made an effort to shortlist experts who are eminent scientists,
educationists, jurists, subject experts, and administrators in their
own right. We have further attempted to set out that nominees
of the Chancellor, Chief Minister, UGC, State Government, the
Higher Education Department of West Bengal the intervenors etc.
are adequately represented.
11. While shortlisting the experts for composition of the Search-cm-
Selection Committee, we have been further guided by the nature
of subjects and disciplines in which education is being imparted in
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 77

14. The learned Chairperson is hereby authorized to constitute separate or
joint Search-cum-Selection Committees for one or more Universities,
keeping in view the nature of subjects/disciplines in which education
is being imparted in such pooled Universities. The Chairperson is
requested to nominate 4 persons out of the empaneled experts,
whom he finds capable of short-listing suitable names for appointment
as Vice-Chancellors. Learned Chairperson shall preside over every
Search-cum-Selection Committee and thus, composition of each
such Committee shall be five. The Search-cum-Selection Committee
shall prepare a panel of at least 03 names (alphabetically and not
in order of merit) for each University.
15. The learned Chairperson is requested to constitute the Search- cum-
Selection Committees for the group or the individual Universities as
early as possible and preferably within two weeks. The Department of
Higher Education, Government of West Bengal is hereby nominated as
the nodal department of the State Government to issue advertisements
giving vide publicity to invite applications for the posts of Vice-
Chancellors. Such advertisements shall contain the details of the
requisite qualification and other eligibility conditions, with a specific
reference to this Court’s order so as to infuse confidence, leaving no
uncertainty in the minds of the meritorious aspirants in submitting their
claims. The advertisements shall give four weeks’ time to submit the
applications. Such applications shall be scrutinized by the concerned
department of the State Government within one week and shall
thereafter the entire set of all applications be placed before the learned
Chairperson of the Search-cum-Selection Committee, who in turn,
will get the dossier of each candidate prepared for consideration of
the Search-cum-Selection Committee. The Search Committee may
endeavour to complete their task within three months from today.
16. The learned Chairperson shall be paid an honorarium of Rs. 3 lakhs
for every effective day of proceedings of the Search Committee, until
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 85
The State of West Bengal v. Dr. Sanat Kumar Ghosh and Ors.
the entire process is completed. The State Government, in addition
to honorarium, provide the Chairperson with a suitable office and full
secretarial assistance, along with transit accommodation at Kolkata.
The learned Chairperson shall also be provided with an official
vehicle and necessary paraphernalia forthwith, commensurate to
the constitutional position held by him in the past.
17. The members of the Search-cum-Selection Committee shall be
entitled to such allowance, perks, and facilities as may have been
prescribed under the Statutes or by the State Government. If nothing
has been prescribed, in that case, the petitioner-State shall apprise
this Court of the status on the next date of hearing to enable us to
pass appropriate order in this regard. Meanwhile, State Government
is directed to reimburse their air fare (economy class) lodging and
boarding expenses within one week of submission of such claims.
18. The recommendations made by the Search-cum-Selection Committee,
duly endorsed by the learned Chairperson, shall be put up before
the Chief Minister (and not the Minister-in-charge of a Department)
for necessary consideration. In case the Chief Minister, State of
West Bengal has reasons to believe that any short-listed person is
unsuitable for appointment as Vice-Chancellor, the remarks to this
effect along with supporting material and the original record of the
recommendation made by the Search-cum-Selection Committee,
shall be put up before the learned Chancellor within two weeks. The
Chief Minister shall be entitled to recommend the shortlisted names
in order of preference for appointment as Vice-Chancellors.
19. The learned Chancellor on the receipt of record from the Chief Minister
of the State, shall appoint the Vice-Chancellors out of the empaneled
names, in the same order of preference as recommended by the
Chief Minister of the State. In case the learned Chancellor has any
reservation against the empaneled names and/or the remarks made
by the Chief Minister of the State against any short-listed candidate,
the learned Chancellor shall be entitled to put up his own opinion on
file, duly supported with reasons and relevant material.
20. The learned Chancellor shall accord his approval (save and except
when there is a difference of opinion) within two weeks of receipt of
file from the Chief Minister of the State. The Department of Higher
Education, Government of West Bengal or any other concerned
Department of the State Government are hereby directed to notify
86 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the appointment within one week from the date of receipt of approval
from the learned Chancellor of the University.
21. In the case(s) where the Chief Minister of the State has objected
to the inclusion of any name in the panel and such objection is
not acceptable to the Chancellor or where the Chancellor has an
objection against empanelment of any particular name for which he
has assigned his own reasons, all such files shall be put up before
this Court. We make it clear that a final decision in this regard shall
be taken by this Court after giving reasonable opportunity of being
heard to the objectors.
22. The State of West Bengal shall file the Status Report in respect to
compliance of the directions issued here-in-above before the next
date of hearing. We make it clear that since the constitution and
composition of Search-cum-Selection Committee is at the instance
and with the consent of the parties, we will not entertain any objection
from any side for non-compliance.
Result of the case: Directions issued.

M/S Bharti Airtel Limited
(Criminal Appeal Nos. 1577-1578 of 2024)
15 March 2024
[B.R. Gavai* and Sandeep Mehta, JJ.]","The High Court rejected the prayer for quashing of criminal
complaints qua the appellant in connection with the offence
punishable u/s. 138 r/w. s.142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881.
","Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138 r/w. s.142 – The
grievance of the complainant-respondent is that in-spite of
regular follow-ups and reminders, the company-accused
no.1 failed and neglected to clear the respondent’s dues –
On repeated demands, the company furnished respondent
five cheques – When complainant deposited the cheques,
they were returned unpaid with reason “payment stopped by
drawer” – Accordingly, the respondent filed two complaints
u/s. 190(i)(a) of the Cr.P.C. for offences punishable u/ss. 138
& 142 of the N.I. Act – Both the complaints were filed against
three accused persons including appellant herein (accused
no.3) – Appellant sought to quash criminal proceedings against
her u/s. 482 Cr.P.C, however the same was dismissed by the
High Court – Propriety:
Held: On perusal of the complaint, it is clear that the only allegation
against the present appellant is that she and the accused No.2
had no intention to pay the dues that they owe to the complainant
– It is stated that the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused (appellant
herein) are the Directors, promoters of the 1st accused being
the Company – It is further averred that the 2nd accused is the
authorized signatory, who is in-charge of and responsible for the
day-to-day affairs of the Company, i.e., the 1st accused – It can be
clearly seen that there is no averment to the effect that the present
appellant is in-charge of and responsible for the day-to-day affairs

of the Company – It is also not the case of the respondent that the
appellant is either the Managing Director or the Joint Managing
Director of the Company – The averments made are not sufficient
to invoke the provisions of s.141 of the N.I. Act qua the appellant
– Thus, the criminal proceedings in connection with the offence
punishable u/s. 138 r/w. s.142 of the N.I. Act are quashed and set
aside qua the present appellant. [Paras 19-22]
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.138, s.141 – Vicarious
liability of the director:
Held: Merely reproducing the words of the section without a clear
statement of fact as to how and in what manner a director of the
company was responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company, would not ipso facto make the director vicariously liable.

3470 & 5767 of 2019 and Crl. M.P. Nos. 2224, 2225 & 3255 of 2019,
whereby the High Court rejected the prayer for quashing of C.C.
Nos. 3151 & 3150 of 2017, on the file of learned XVIII Metropolitan
Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai (now transferred to the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate, Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet, Chennai),
in connection with the offence punishable under Section 138 read
with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter
referred to as “the N.I. Act”).
3. The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeals are as follows:
650 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
3.1 M/s. Bharti Airtel Limited (hereinafter referred to as, “complainant”
or “respondent”), is a company engaged in the business of
providing telecommunication services, under a license issued
by the Government of India, in various telecom circles in India.
3.2 One M/s. Fibtel Telecom Solutions (India) Private Limited
(hereinafter referred to as, “Fibtel Telecom Solutions” or
“Company”), a company registered with the Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India (TRAI) as a telemarketer, had approached the
respondent intending to obtain telecom resources for the purpose
of transactional communication and requested the complainant
for allotment of telecom resources for the said purpose. One
Manju Sukumaran Lalitha is the Director & Authorized Signatory
of Fibtel Telecom Solutions and one Susela Padmavathy Amma,
the appellant herein, is the Director of Fibtel Telecom Solutions.
3.3 Based on the representation made by Fibtel Telecom Solutions,
the respondent had agreed to provide the required services,
whereupon the parties entered into a Service Agreement, vide
which Fibtel Telecom Solutions had to pay Rs. 14,00,000/- as
fixed monthly recurring charges to the respondent. It is the thus
the case of the respondent that Fibtel Telecom Solutions owes
a sum of Rs. 2,55,08,309/-, in lieu of the service provided to
it by the respondent.
3.4 However, the grievance of the respondent is that in-spite of
regular follow-ups and reminders, Fibtel Telecom Solutions
failed and neglected to clear the respondent’s dues. Only
thereafter, upon repeated demands made by the respondent,
Fibtel Telecom Solutions furnished five post-dated cheques to
the complainant, on 17 th June 2016, details of which are as
given below:
Sr. No. Cheque No. Cheque Dated Cheque Amount
1 414199 25.06.2016 Rs. 25,00,000/-
2 414196 31.08.2016 Rs. 50,00,000/-
3 414204 31.08.2016 Rs. 80,00,000/-
4 414195 31.07.2016 Rs. 45,00,000/-
5 414205 30.09.2016 Rs. 80,00,000/-
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 651

3.5 On deposit of the cheque mentioned at Sr. No. 1 in the table,
bearing cheque no. 414199 and dated 25th June 2016, by the
respondent, the said cheque was returned to it unpaid with
reason “payment stopped by drawer”. Aggrieved thereby, the
respondent issued a legal notice to Fibtel Telecom Solutions,
on receipt of which & following an oral agreement between
them, a payment schedule was agreed to and a cheque for an
amount of Rs. 25,00,000/- drawn by Fibtel Telecom Solutions
was honoured by it. However, when the complainant deposited
the remaining four cheques as mentioned at Sr. No. 2 to 5 in
the table, the same were returned to it unpaid with reason
“payment stopped by drawer”. Details of deposit & return of
cheques are as given below:

3.6 Accordingly, the respondent filed two complaints under Section
190(i)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC” for
short) for offences punishable under Section 138 & 142 of the
N.I. Act, being C.C. No. 3151 of 2017 dated 30th November, 2016
and C.C. No. 3150 of 2017 dated 23rd December, 2016, before
the learned XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai.
3.7 Both the complaints have been filed against three accused
persons namely, Fibtel Telecom Solutions, arrayed as Accused
No. 1; Manju Sukumaran Lalitha, arrayed as Accused No. 2 &
Susela Padmavathy Amma, the appellant herein, arrayed as
Accused No. 3.
3.8 Accused No. 3, who is a female senior citizen and the Director
of Fibtel Telecom Solutions, filed Crl. O.P. No. 3470 of 2019
against C.C. No. 3151 of 2017 & Crl. O.P. No. 5767 of 2019
against C.C. No. 3150 of 2017, before the High Court under
652 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing of the criminal complaints
qua her.
3.9 Vide impugned judgment and order, dated 26th April, 2022, the
High Court dismissed Crl. O.P. Nos. 3470 & 5767 of 2019 and
Crl. M.P. Nos. 2224, 2225 & 3255 of 2019, but directed the
concerned trial court to dispose of the case within a period of
three months.
3.10 Aggrieved by the rejection of the petition for quashing of criminal
complaints, the appellant herein filed the present appeal.
3.11 Vide order dated 12 th December 2022, this Court had issued
notice and stay of further proceedings qua the appellant was
granted.
4. We have heard Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for the
appellant and Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel appearing
for the respondent.
5. Shri Manoj V. George, learned counsel for the appellant submitted
that the appellant is an aged-lady and was not involved in the day-to-
day affairs of the Company. It is submitted that even in the complaint
there are no averments that the appellant was in-charge of day-to-
day affairs of the Company. It is further submitted that the appellant
was also not a signatory to the cheque in question. It was only the
accused No.2 who was the signatory to the cheque. It is, therefore,
submitted that the High Court has grossly erred in not allowing the
petition for quashing of criminal complaints qua the appellant. Learned
counsel relied on the judgments of this Court in the cases of N.K.
Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh and others1, S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals
Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla and another2 Ashoke Mal Bafna vs. Upper
India Steel Manufacturing and Engineering Company Limited3,

6. Shri Lakshmeesh S. Kamath, learned counsel for the respondent,
on the contrary, submitted that the learned judge of the High Court
has rightly, after considering the material on record, dismissed the
petition for quashing of criminal complaints qua the appellant. It is
submitted that the grounds raised are the defense of the accused
and it can only be raised at the stage of the trial. It is, therefore,
submitted that no interference is warranted in the present appeal.
7. In the case of State of Haryana vs. Brij Lal Mittal and others6,
this Court observed thus:
“8. Nonetheless, we find that the impugned judgment of
the High Court has got to be upheld for an altogether
different reason. Admittedly, the three respondents were
being prosecuted as directors of the manufacturers with
the aid of Section 34(1) of the Act which reads as under:
“34. Offences by companies.—(1) Where an offence
under this Act has been committed by a company,
every person who at the time the offence was
committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to
the company for the conduct of the business of the
company, as well as the company shall be deemed
to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this sub-
section shall render any such person liable to
any punishment provided in this Act if he proves
that the offence was committed without his
knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence
to prevent the commission of such offence.”
It is thus seen that the vicarious liability of a person for
being prosecuted for an offence committed under the Act
by a company arises if at the material time he was in
charge of and was also responsible to the company for
the conduct of its business. Simply because a person is a
director of the company it does not necessarily mean that
6 [1998] 3 SCR 104 : (1998) 5 SCC 343
654 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
he fulfils both the above requirements so as to make him
liable. Conversely, without being a director a person can
be in charge of and responsible to the company for the
conduct of its business. From the complaint in question
we, however, find that except a bald statement that the
respondents were directors of the manufacturers, there is
no other allegation to indicate, even prima facie, that they
were in charge of the company and also responsible to
the company for the conduct of its business.”
8. It could thus be seen that this Court had held that simply because
a person is a director of the company, it does not necessarily mean
that he fulfils the twin requirements of Section 34(1) of the said Act
so as to make him liable. It has been held that a person cannot be
made liable unless, at the material time, he was in-charge of and
was also responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
9. In the case of S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra), this Court was
considering the question as to whether it was sufficient to make the
person liable for being a director of a company under Section 141
of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. This Court considered the
definition of the word “director as defined in Section 2(13) of the
Companies Act, 1956. This Court observed thus:
“8. ....... There is nothing which suggests that simply by
being a director in a company, one is supposed to discharge
particular functions on behalf of a company. It happens
that a person may be a director in a company but he may
not know anything about the day-to-day functioning of the
company. As a director he may be attending meetings of
the Board of Directors of the company where usually they
decide policy matters and guide the course of business
of a company. It may be that a Board of Directors may
appoint sub-committees consisting of one or two directors
out of the Board of the company who may be made
responsible for the day-to-day functions of the company.
These are matters which form part of resolutions of the
Board of Directors of a company. Nothing is oral. What
emerges from this is that the role of a director in a company
is a question of fact depending on the peculiar facts in
each case. There is no universal rule that a director of
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 655
Susela Padmavathy Amma v. M/S Bharti Airtel Limited
a company is in charge of its everyday affairs. We have
discussed about the position of a director in a company in
order to illustrate the point that there is no magic as such
in a particular word, be it director, manager or secretary.
It all depends upon the respective roles assigned to the
officers in a company. .....”
10. It was held that merely because a person is a director of a company,
it is not necessary that he is aware about the day-to-day functioning
of the company. This Court held that there is no universal rule that
a director of a company is in charge of its everyday affairs. It was,
therefore, necessary, to aver as to how the director of the company
was in charge of day-to-day affairs of the company or responsible
to the affairs of the company. This Court, however, clarified that
the position of a managing director or a joint managing director
in a company may be different. This Court further held that these
persons, as the designation of their office suggests, are in charge of
a company and are responsible for the conduct of the business of
the company. To escape liability, they will have to prove that when
the offence was committed, they had no knowledge of the offence
or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission
of the offence.
11. In the case of Pooja Ravinder Devidasani vs. State of Maharashtra
and another7 this Court observed thus:
“17. ....... Every person connected with the Company will
not fall into the ambit of the provision. Time and again, it
has been asserted by this Court that only those persons
who were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of
the business of the Company at the time of commission
of an offence will be liable for criminal action. A Director,
who was not in charge of and was not responsible for the
conduct of the business of the Company at the relevant
time, will not be liable for an offence under Section 141 of
the NI Act. In National Small Industries Corpn. [National
Small Industries Corpn. Ltd. v. Harmeet Singh Paintal,
(2010) 3 SCC 330 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 677 : (2010) 2
7 [2014] 14 SCR 1468 : (2014) 16 SCC 1
656 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
SCC (Cri) 1113] this Court observed: (SCC p. 336, paras
13-14)
“13. Section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious
liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly
construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald
cursory statement in a complaint that the Director (arrayed
as an accused) is in charge of and responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company
without anything more as to the role of the Director. But the
complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner
Respondent 1 was in charge of or was responsible to the
accused Company for the conduct of its business. This is
in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes,
especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability.
14. A company may have a number of Directors and to
make any or all the Directors as accused in a complaint
merely on the basis of a statement that they are in charge
of and responsible for the conduct of the business of
the company without anything more is not a sufficient or
adequate fulfilment of the requirements under Section 141.”
(emphasis in original)
18. In Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.H. Mehta [Girdhari Lal Gupta
v. D.H. Mehta, (1971) 3 SCC 189 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 279 :
AIR 1971 SC 2162] , this Court observed that a person “in
charge of a business” means that the person should be in
overall control of the day-to-day business of the Company.
19. A Director of a company is liable to be convicted for
an offence committed by the company if he/she was in
charge of and was responsible to the company for the
conduct of its business or if it is proved that the offence
was committed with the consent or connivance of, or was
attributable to any negligence on the part of the Director
concerned (see State of Karnataka v. Pratap Chand [State
of Karnataka v. Pratap Chand, (1981) 2 SCC 335 : 1981
SCC (Cri) 453] ).
20. In other words, the law laid down by this Court is that
for making a Director of a company liable for the offences
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 657
Susela Padmavathy Amma v. M/S Bharti Airtel Limited
committed by the company under Section 141 of the NI
Act, there must be specific averments against the Director
showing as to how and in what manner the Director was
responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.
21. In Sabitha Ramamurthy v. R.B.S. Channabasavaradhya
[Sabitha Ramamurthy v. R.B.S. Channabasavaradhya,
(2006) 10 SCC 581 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 621] , it was held
by this Court that: (SCC pp. 584-85, para 7)
“7. ... it is not necessary for the complainant to specifically
reproduce the wordings of the section but what is required
is a clear statement of fact so as to enable the court to
arrive at a prima facie opinion that the accused is vicariously
liable. Section 141 raises a legal fiction. By reason of the
said provision, a person although is not personally liable for
commission of such an offence would be vicariously liable
therefor. Such vicarious liability can be inferred so far as a
company registered or incorporated under the Companies
Act, 1956 is concerned only if the requisite statements,
which are required to be averred in the complaint petition,
are made so as to make the accused therein vicariously
liable for the offence committed by the company.”
(emphasis supplied)
By verbatim reproducing the words of the section without
a clear statement of fact supported by proper evidence,
so as to make the accused vicariously liable, is a ground
for quashing proceedings initiated against such person
under Section 141 of the NI Act.”
12. It could thus clearly be seen that this Court has held that merely
reproducing the words of the section without a clear statement of
fact as to how and in what manner a director of the company was
responsible for the conduct of the business of the company, would
not ipso facto make the director vicariously liable.
13. A similar view has previously been taken by this Court in the case
of K.K. Ahuja vs. V.K. Vora and another8.
8 [2009] 9 SCR 1144 : (2009) 10 SCC 48
658 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
14. In the case of State of NCT of Delhi through Prosecuting Officer,
Insecticides, Government of NCT, Delhi vs. Rajiv Khurana9, this
Court reiterated the position thus:
“17. The ratio of all these cases is that the complainant
is required to state in the complaint how a Director who
is sought to be made an accused, was in charge of the
business of the company or responsible for the conduct of
the company’s business. Every Director need not be and
is not in charge of the business of the company. If that
is the position with regard to a Director, it is needless to
emphasise that in the case of non-Director officers, it is
all the more necessary to state what were his duties and
responsibilities in the conduct of business of the company
and how and in what manner he is responsible or liable.”
15. In the case of Ashoke Mal Bafna (supra), this Court observed thus:
“9. To fasten vicarious liability under Section 141 of the
Act on a person, the law is well settled by this Court in a
catena of cases that the complainant should specifically
show as to how and in what manner the accused was
responsible. Simply because a person is a Director of a
defaulter Company, does not make him liable under the
Act. Time and again, it has been asserted by this Court
that only the person who was at the helm of affairs of
the Company and in charge of and responsible for the
conduct of the business at the time of commission of
an offence will be liable for criminal action. (See Pooja
Ravinder Devidasani v. State of Maharashtra [Pooja
Ravinder Devidasani v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 16
SCC 1 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 384 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri)
378 : AIR 2015 SC 675].)
10. In other words, the law laid down by this Court is
that for making a Director of a Company liable for the
offences committed by the Company under Section 141
of the Act, there must be specific averments against
the Director showing as to how and in what manner the
9 [2010] 9 SCR 387 : (2010) 11 SCC 469
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 659
Susela Padmavathy Amma v. M/S Bharti Airtel Limited
Director was responsible for the conduct of the business
of the Company.”
16. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the case of Lalankumar
Singh and others vs. State of Maharashtra10 to which one of us
(B.R. Gavai, J.) was a party.
17. In the light of this settled legal position, let us examine the averments
made in the complaints.
18. It will be relevant to refer to para 16 of the complaint bearing No.
CC 3151/2017 filed by the respondent before the Court of XVIII
Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai dated 30th November
2016, which reads thus:
“16. The Complainant states that the Accused has an
intention of cheating the Complainant. The 2nd and 3rd
Accused herein has no intention to pay the dues that
they owe to the Complainant. Instead, making the
complainant believe that the same would be paid and
through which trying to push the liability to future. It is
also pertinent to note that the 2nd and 3rd of the Accused
herein are the Directors, promoters of the 1st Accused
being the Company. The 2nd of the Accused herein
is the authorized signatory, who is in-charge of and
responsible for the day to day affairs of the Company,
the 1st Accused.”
19. It can thus be seen that the only allegation against the present
appellant is that the present appellant and the accused No.2 had
no intention to pay the dues that they owe to the complainant. It is
stated that the 2 nd accused and the 3rd accused (appellant herein)
are the Directors, promoters of the 1st accused being the Company.
It is further averred that the 2 nd accused is the authorized signatory,
who is in-charge of and responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the
Company, i.e., the 1st accused.
20. It can thus be clearly seen that there is no averment to the effect
that the present appellant is in-charge of and responsible for the
day-to-day affairs of the Company. It is also not the case of the
10 [2022] 14 SCR 573 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1383
660 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
respondent that the appellant is either the Managing Director or the
Joint Managing Director of the Company.
21. It can thus clearly be seen that the averments made are not sufficient
to invoke the provisions of Section 141 of the N.I. Act qua the appellant.
22. In the result, we find that the present appeals deserve to be allowed.
It is ordered accordingly. The judgment and order passed by the
High Court dated 26th April, 2022 is quashed and set aside. The
proceedings in CC Nos. 3151 and 3150 of 2017 on the file of learned
XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai (now transferred to
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Fast Track Court-III, Saidapet,
Chennai) in connection with the offence punishable under Section
138 read with Section 142 of the N.I. Act are quashed and set aside
qua the present appellant.

","Judgment
Ahsanuddin Amanullah, J.
1. Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent-in-person.
2. The present appeal arises out of the final judgment and order dated
31.03.2022 (hereinafter referred to as the “impugned judgment”),
passed by a learned Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka
at Bengaluru (hereinafter referred to as the “High Court”) in Writ
Appeal No.4067 of 2019 (L-TER) arising from Writ Petition No.13842
of 2018 (L-TER) by which the High Court dismissed the appeal filed
by the appellant (hereinafter also referred to as the “Company”),
which was occasioned on account of the learned Single Judge partly
allowing the respondent’s writ petition.
THE FACTUAL COMPASS:
3. The respondent, upon being interviewed by the appellant’s concerned
officials was appointed as the Regional Business Head (South) –
Government Enterprise Services on 22.06.2009, in the grade of
Senior Manager (B2)-Sales. The same carried an annual benefits
package of Rs.22,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Two lakhs) with fixed pay
104 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of Rs.13,20,000/- (Rupees Thirteen Lakhs Twenty Thousand) and
variable pay under the Sales Incentive Plan (hereinafter referred to as
“SIP”) of Rs.8,80,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs and Eighty Thousand).
The respondent worked as Team Leader and Regional Business
Head (South) - Government Enterprise Services, heading a team
comprising four Account Managers (Sales), one each for the States
of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively.
The said Managers were working under the supervision and control
of the respondent and were in the B1 and B2 salary levels. On
24.03.2011, the respondent made an initial resignation request on the
internal system, which was accepted by the appellant on 09.05.2011.
In terms thereof, the respondent was paid Rs.5,92,538/- (Rupees
Five Lakhs Ninety-Two Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty-Eight) by
the appellant in full and final settlement of all his claims.
4. After about 19 months, the respondent filed a petition before the
Deputy Labour Commissioner, Region-2, Bengaluru, alleging his
resignation to be a forceful resignation, which resulted in initiation of
conciliation proceedings but ended in failure. However, on 27.06.2013,
brushing aside the appellant’s objections that the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the “ID Act”) was not applicable
in the case of the respondent as he performed managerial and
supervisory work at an annual package totalling Rs.22,00,000/-
(Rupees Twenty-Two Lakhs) and thus, was not a “workman”, within
the meaning of Section 2(s)1, ID Act, the “appropriate Government”2

2 ‘(a) “appropriate Government” means,—
(i) in relation to any Industrial Disputes concerning any industry carried on by or under the
authority of the Central Government or by a railway company or concerning any such
controlled industry as may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government or in relation
to an Industrial Dispute concerning a Dock Labour Board established under Section 5-A
of the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Act, 1948 (9 of 1948), or the Industrial
Finance Corporation of India Limited formed and registered under the Companies Act,
1956], or the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation established under Section 3 of the
Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 (34 of 1948), or the Board of Trustees constituted

M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
[herein, the Government of Karnataka] referred the dispute to the
Labour Court under Section 10(1)(c)3, ID Act on 27.06.2013. Pleadings
were completed and witnesses were examined by both sides.
5. On 05.09.2017, the Labour Court made its Award recording findings
of fact and held that the respondent had failed to plead or prove that
he was a “workman” and that on an assessment of the evidence on
record, he was performing the role of a Manager and thus was not a
“workman” within the meaning of Section 2(s), ID Act, and accordingly
rejected the reference. Aggrieved, the respondent filed Writ Petition
No.13842 of 2018 (L-TER) before the High Court challenging the
Labour Court’s Award and the learned Single Judge by judgment and
order dated 29.11.2019, partly allowed the writ petition, relying upon
the judgment of this Court in Ved Prakash Gupta v Delton Cable
India (P.) Ltd., (1984) 2 SCC 569. The learned Single Judge held
that since there was an absence of power in the respondent, whilst
the Unit Trust of India Act, 1963 (52 of 1963), or the Food Corporation of India established
under Section 3, or a Board of Management established for two or more contiguous States
under Section 16 of the Food Corporations Act, 1964 (37 of 1964), or the Airports Authority
of India constituted under Section 3 of the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994 (55 of 1994),
or a Regional Rural Bank established under Section 3 of the Regional Rural Banks Act,
1976 (21 of 1976), or the Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation Limited or the Industrial
Reconstruction Corporation of India Limited, or the Banking Service Commission established,
under Section 3 of the Banking Service Commission Act, 1975, or an air transport service,
or a banking or an insurance company, a mine, an oilfield, a Cantonment Board, or a major
port, any company in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is

subsidiary companies set up by the principal undertaking and autonomous bodies owned or
controlled by the State Government, the State Government:
Provided that in case of a dispute between a contractor and the contract labour employed
through the contractor in any industrial establishment where such dispute first arose, the
appropriate Government shall be the Central Government or the State Government, as the
case may be, which has control over such industrial establishment.’

opinion that any industrial dispute exists or is apprehended, it may at any time, by order in writing,—
(a) xxx; or
(b) xxx; or
(c) refer the dispute or any matter appearing to be connected with, or relevant to, the dispute, if it
relates to any matter specified in the Second Schedule, to a Labour Court for adjudication; or
(d) xxx:
Provided that where the dispute relates to any matter specified in the Third Schedule and is not likely
to affect more than one hundred workmen, the appropriate Government may, if it so thinks fit, make the
reference to a Labour Court under clause (c) :’
106 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in service of the appellant, to appoint, dismiss or hold disciplinary
enquiries against other employees, the same indicated that the
respondent did not belong to the managerial category and held him
to be a “workman”. The learned Single Judge, thus, set aside the
award and remanded the matter to the Labour Court for adjudication
on merits within 3 months therefrom. Aggrieved by the learned Single
Judge’s judgment, the appellant filed Writ Appeal No.4067 of 2019
(L-TER) before the learned Division Bench, which was dismissed
vide the impugned judgment.
SUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT:
6. Mr C U Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that
the Labour Court’s order covered in detail all the factual and legal
aspects based on the evidence produced before it by both sides and
needed no interference. It was urged that the learned Single Judge
as also the learned Division Bench of the High Court erroneously
interfered in the matter. It was submitted that the respondent was a
Regional Business Head, whose nature of duties clearly established
that he was a senior manager in the managerial cadre, earning an
annual package of Rs.22,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Two Lakhs)
and thus, was not covered by the definition of “workman” as per
Section 2(s), ID Act. He contended that even the approach adopted
by the learned Single Judge of re-appreciating the entire evidence
and coming to a fresh conclusion was not proper while exercising
jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India,
1950 (hereinafter referred to as the “Constitution”) as it was not a
Court of first instance.
7. Mr Singh submitted that even without examining the Award and
findings of the Labour Court, the learned Single Judge concluded
that the same were perverse. It was advanced that the learned
Division Bench, on the assumption that the learned Single Judge
had examined the materials on record, concurred with the judgment
of the learned Single Judge, ignoring the admitted fact that the
respondent had worked in progressively more senior managerial
positions before joining the appellant as Senior Manager (Sales) in
Band-2 which was equivalent to Deputy General Manager as also
that his previous employment was as Regional Manager (South)
in Kodak India Private Limited and he had joined the appellant as
Head of Sales Operations for four Southern States (Karnataka, Tamil
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 107
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala) and was also the Team Leader
of a managerial team which comprised an Account Manager (Sales)
each for the four States. It was canvassed that the respondent was
also writing the half-yearly and annual performance assessments
and appraisals of the Account Managers referred supra as also
liaising, negotiating and representing the appellant/Company with
senior government officials of the Indian Administrative Service and
the General Managers of various Public Sector Undertakings.
8. Further, learned Senior Advocate submitted that the burden of proving
that the respondent was a “workman” under the ID Act, was not
discharged and he had neither pleaded nor proved the nature of
duties and functions performed by him. It was his stand that once
the respondent tendered his resignation on 24.03.2011, which was
accepted and he was relieved from service on 09.05.2011, pursuant
whereto he accepted the full and final settlement on 23.06.2011
along with receipt of SIP on 26.08.2011, he had clearly accepted
what had transpired. It was advanced that, therefore, after a period
of over 1½ years raising an industrial dispute before the Deputy
Labour Commissioner and Conciliation Officer, Bengaluru, on the
ground that his resignation was obtained under coercion and duress,
was not tenable and was rightly rejected by the Labour Court. It was
submitted that ironically the documents relied upon by the respondent
himself clearly demonstrated that he was a member of the senior
management cadre, being in-charge of and supervising the Accounts
Managers in the four Southern States as noted hereinbefore, which,
by no stretch of imagination can lead to the conclusion that he was
a “workman”. Learned Senior counsel submitted that in the written
statement filed by the Company in reply to the Statement of Claim
of the respondent, it was specifically pleaded that the respondent
was not a “workman” and the nature of his duties were described in
detail. However, the learned Single Judge grossly erred and misread
the documentary and oral evidence while reaching the incorrect
conclusion that the respondent was a “workman” within the meaning
of Section 2(s), ID Act.
9. On the legal aspect, it was contended that the High Court had
exceeded its jurisdiction in such matters, as the law was that a writ
of certiorari under Article 226 of the Constitution can be issued only
to correct errors of jurisdiction where a Court or Tribunal acts with
material irregularity or in violation of natural justice but not for the
108 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
purpose of re-appreciation of evidence or acting as a Court of appeal.
For such proposition, reliance was placed on the judgment in Syed
Yakub v K S Radha Krishnan, AIR 1964 SC 477, the relevant being
Paragraph 74. Similarly, it was contended that in matters pertaining
to industrial law, it has been held that unless the High Court first
concludes that the Award or Order of a Labour Court or Industrial
Tribunal is based on no evidence or is perverse, the High Court
cannot proceed to reappreciate the evidence under Articles 226 or
227 of the Constitution. In this regard, following judgments were
relied on - Indian Overseas Bank v IOB Staff Canteen Workers
Union, (2000) 4 SCC 245; Anoop Sharma v Public Health Division,
Haryana, (2010) 5 SCC 497, relevant being Paragraphs 12-145, and;
4 ‘7. The question about the limits of the jurisdiction of High Courts in issuing a writ of certiorari under Article
226 has been frequently considered by this Court and the true legal position in that behalf is no longer
in doubt. A writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by inferior courts
or tribunals : these are cases where orders are passed by inferior courts or tribunals without jurisdiction,
or is in excess of it, or as a result of failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ can similarly be issued where
in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the Court or Tribunal acts illegally or properly, as for instance,
it decides a question without giving an opportunity, be heard to the party affected by the order, or where
the procedure adopted in dealing with the dispute is opposed to principles of natural justice. There is,
however, no doubt that the jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari is a supervisory jurisdiction and the
Court exercising it is not entitled to act as an appellate Court. This limitation necessarily means that
findings of fact reached by the inferior Court or Tribunal as result of the appreciation of evidence cannot
be reopened or questioned in writ proceedings. An error of law which is apparent on the face of the
record can be corrected by a writ, but not an error of fact, however grave it may appear to be. In regard
to a finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal, a writ of certiorari can be issued if it is shown that in recording
the said finding, the Tribunal had erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence, or
had erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which has influenced the impugned finding. Similarly,
if a finding of fact is based on no evidence, that would be regarded as an error of law which can be
corrected by a writ of certiorari. In dealing with this category of cases, however, we must always bear
in mind that a finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal cannot be challenged in proceedings for a writ
of certiorari on the ground that the relevant and material evidence adduced before the Tribunal was
insufficient or inadequate to sustain the impugned finding. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence led
on a point and the inference of fact to be drawn from the said finding are within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Tribunal, and the said points cannot be agitated before a writ Court. It is within these limits that the
jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 226 to issue a writ of certiorari can be legitimately
exercised (vide Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque [(1955) 1 SCR 1104] Nagandra Nath Bora v.
Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals Assam [(1958) SCR 1240] and Kaushalya Devi v. Bachittar
Singh [AIR 1960 SC 1168].’
5 ‘12. A reading of the impugned order shows that the Division Bench of the High Court set aside the award
of the Labour Court without even adverting to the fact that challenge to similar award passed in the cases
of other employees was negatived by the High Court and this Court. We have no doubt that if the Division
Bench had taken the trouble of ascertaining the status of the disputes raised by other employees, then
it would have discovered that the award of reinstatement of similarly situated employees has been
upheld by the High Court and this Court and in that event, it may not have passed the impugned order.
That apart, we find that even though the Division Bench did not come to the conclusion that the finding
recorded by the Labour Court on the issue of non-compliance with Section 25-F of the Act is vitiated
by an error of law apparent on the face of the record, it allowed the writ petition by assuming that the
appellant’s initial engagement/employment was not legal and the respondent had complied with the
conditions of a valid retrenchment.
13. In our view, the approach adopted by the Division Bench is contrary to the judicially recognised
limitations of the High Court’s power to issue writ of certiorari under Article 226 of the Constitution—Syed
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 109
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
Pepsico India Holding (P) Ltd. v Krishna Kant Pandey, (2015)
4 SCC 270.
10. Further, it was submitted that unless a person proves that he is
employed to perform any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical,
operational, clerical, or supervisory work, such person does not
fall within the definition of “workman” under Section 2(s), ID Act
and that it has been held that a teacher, an advertising manager, a
chemist employed in a sugar mill, gate sergeant in a tannery, and a
welfare officer in an educational institution are not “workman”, and
that a legal assistant, whose job is not stereotyped and involves
creativity can never be a “workman”. It was submitted that the High
Court has, thus, clearly fallen in error in not appreciating the ratios
of judgments of this Court in Heavy Engineering Corporation v
Presiding Officer, Labour Court, (1996) 11 SCC 236; Muir Mills
Yakoobv. K.S. Radhakrishnan [AIR 1964 SC 477 : (1964) 5 SCR 64] , Municipal Board, Saharanpur
v. Imperial Tobacco of India Ltd. [(1999) 1 SCC 566] , Lakshmi Precision Screws Ltd. v. Ram Bahagat
[(2002) 6 SCC 552 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 926] , Mohd. Shahnawaz Akhtar v. ADJ, Varanasi [(2010) 5 SCC
510 : JT (2002) 8 SC 69] , Mukand Ltd. v. Staff and Officers’ Assn. [(2004) 10 SCC 460 : 2004 SCC (L&S)
798] , Dharamraj v. Chhitan [(2006) 12 SCC 349 : (2006) 11 Scale 292] and CIT v. Saurashtra Kutch
Stock Exchange Ltd. [(2008) 14 SCC 171 : (2008) 12 Scale 582]
14. In Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan [AIR 1964 SC 477: (1964) 5 SCR 64] the Constitution Bench
of this Court considered the scope of the High Court’s jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari in cases
involving challenge to the orders passed by the authorities entrusted with quasi-judicial functions under
the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Speaking for the majority of the Constitution Bench, Gajendragadkar, J.
observed as under: (AIR pp. 479-80, para 7)
“7. … A writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by inferior
courts or tribunals; these are cases where orders are passed by inferior courts or tribunals without
jurisdiction, or is in excess of it, or as a result of failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ can similarly
be issued where in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the court or tribunal acts illegally or
improperly, as for instance, it decides a question without giving an opportunity to be heard to
the party affected by the order, or where the procedure adopted in dealing with the dispute is
opposed to principles of natural justice. There is, however, no doubt that the jurisdiction to issue a
writ of certiorari is a supervisory jurisdiction and the court exercising it is not entitled to act as an
appellate court. This limitation necessarily means that findings of fact reached by the inferior court
or tribunal as a result of the appreciation of evidence cannot be reopened or questioned in writ
proceedings. An error of law which is apparent on the face of the record can be corrected by a writ,
but not an error of fact, however grave it may appear to be. In regard to a finding of fact recorded
by the Tribunal, a writ of certiorari can be issued if it is shown that in recording the said finding, the
Tribunal had erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence, or had erroneously
admitted inadmissible evidence which has influenced the impugned finding. Similarly, if a finding
of fact is based on no evidence, that would be regarded as an error of law which can be corrected
by a writ of certiorari. In dealing with this category of cases, however, we must always bear in mind
that a finding of fact recorded by the tribunal cannot be challenged in proceedings for a writ of
certiorari on the ground that the relevant and material evidence adduced before the Tribunal was
insufficient or inadequate to sustain the impugned finding. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence
led on a point and the inference of fact to be drawn from the said finding are within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and the said points cannot be agitated before a writ court. It is within
these limits that the jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 226 to issue a writ of
certiorari can be legitimately exercised.”’

1128] , SCC p. 396, paras 21-23)
“21. Once the ratio of May and Baker [AIR 1967 SC 678] and other decisions following the same
had been reiterated despite observations made to the effect that S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 :
1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and other decisions following the same were rendered on the facts of that
case, we are of the opinion that this Court had approved the reasonings of May and Baker [AIR
1967 SC 678] and subsequent decisions in preference to S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983
SCC (L&S) 510] .
22. The Constitution Bench further took notice of the subsequent amendment in the definition
of ‘workman’ and held that even the legislature impliedly did not accept the said interpretation
of this Court in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] and other decisions.
23. It may be true, as has been submitted by Ms Jaising, that S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 :
1983 SCC (L&S) 510] has not been expressly overruled in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC
737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] but once the said decision has been held to have been rendered
perincuriam it cannot be said to have laid down a good law. This Court is bound by the decision of
the Constitution Bench.”
We respectfully agree with the aforesaid exposition of law. There can be no cavil over the proposition
that once a judgment has been declared per incuriam, it does not have the precedential value. After so
stating, the three-Judge Bench did not accept the stand of the appellant therein that he was a workman
and accordingly declined to interfere.
11. As has been stated earlier, the decision that was pressed into service in the application filed for
review is the judgment in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] . In the said case,
the question that was posed in the beginning of the judgment reads thus : (SCC p. 321, para 2)
“2. Whether jurisdiction of the Industrial Courts is ousted in regard to an order of dismissal passed
by Life Insurance Corporation of India, a corporation constituted and incorporated under the Life
Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, is the question involved in this appeal which arises out of a
judgment and order dated 3-2-2006 [LIC v. Industrial Tribunal, Writ Appeal No. 3360 of 2001,
decided on 3-2-2006 (Ker)] passed by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court at Ernakulam.”
12. The facts of R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] that were the subject-
matter of the lis in the said case were that the respondent was appointed as a Development Officer
of LIC and a departmental proceeding was initiated against him and eventually he was found guilty in
respect of certain charges and was dismissed from service by the disciplinary authority. As an industrial
dispute was raised by him, the appropriate Government referred the dispute for adjudication by the
Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal passed an award on 6-2-1993 and reduced the punishment imposed
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 111
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
the appellant contends the said decision squarely covers the case,
but has not been accepted by the learned Single Judge.
by the employer. The said order was assailed before the High Court in the writ petition. Before the High
Court, the decision in M. Venugopal v. LIC [(1994) 2 SCC 323 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 664 : (1994) 27 ATC 84]
was cited. The High Court opined that the said decision was not applicable and placed reliance on the
authority in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] . Thereafter, the Court referred to the
jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal in interfering with the quantum of punishment and after referring to
various provisions of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, opined that it is “State” and on that basis
ruled thus : (R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] , SCC p. 328, paras 35-36)
“35. The jurisdiction of the Industrial Court being wide and it having been conferred with the power
to interfere with the quantum of punishment, it could go into the nature of charges, so as to arrive
at a conclusion as to whether the respondent had misused his position or his acts are in breach of
trust conferred upon him by his employer.
36. It may be true that quantum of loss may not be of much relevance as has been held in Suresh
Pathrella v. Oriental Bank of Commerce [(2006) 10 SCC 572 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 612 : (2007) 1
SCC (L&S) 224] , but there again a question arose as to whether he was in the position of trust
or not.”
13. At this juncture, we are obliged to state that the two-Judge Bench in R. Suresh case [(2008) 11 SCC
319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] referred to the decision in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC
(L&S) 510] and also stated that they were not unmindful of the principle stated in Mukesh K. Tripathi
[(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] . Dealing with the decision in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8
SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] , the Court said that there the question was whether the Apprentice
Development Officer would be a “workman” within the meaning of the provisions of Section 2(s) of the
Act and observed that it was not dealing with the case that pertains to an apprentice.
14. Mr Singh, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant built the plinth of his argument on
the basis of the aforesaid authority with the hope that an enormous structure would come into existence
but as we find on a studied and anxious reading of the judgment, we notice that there is no reference
to the Constitution Bench decision in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5 SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] and
the two-Judge Bench, though has referred to S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510]
and Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] but has not taken note of what the
three-Judge Bench has said in Mukesh K. Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] with
regard to the precedent and how S.K. Verma case [(1983) 4 SCC 214 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 510] is no more
a binding precedent.
15. In our considered opinion, the decision in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S)
1083] cannot be regarded as the precedent for the proposition that a Development Officer in LIC is a
“workman”. In fact, the judgment does not say so but Mr Vasdev, the learned Senior Counsel would
submit that inferring such a ratio, cases are being decided by the High Courts and other authorities.
Though such an apprehension should not be there, yet to clarify the position, we may quote a few lines
from Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat [(1987) 1 SCC 213 : AIR 1987 SC 1073] : (SCC p. 221,
para 18)
“18. … It has been said long time ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides,
and not what logically follows from it. (See Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 :
(1900-03) All ER Rep 1 (HL)] .)”
In view of the aforesaid, any kind of interference is not permissible but, a pregnant one, it has dealt with
the cases of Development Officers of LIC.
16. As we find, the said judgment R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] has been
rendered in ignorance of the ratio laid down by the Constitution Bench in H.R. Adyanthaya [(1994) 5
SCC 737 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 1283] and also the principle stated by the three-Judge Bench in Mukesh K.
Tripathi [(2004) 8 SCC 387 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 1128] that the decision in S.K. Verma [(1983) 4 SCC 214 :
1983 SCC (L&S) 510] is not a precedent, and hence, we are compelled to hold that the pronouncement
in R. Suresh [(2008) 11 SCC 319 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 1083] is per incuriam. We say so on the basis of
the decisions rendered in A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [(1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372] , Punjab
Land Development and Reclamation Corpn. Ltd. v. Labour Court [(1990) 3 SCC 682 : 1991 SCC (L&S)
71] , State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. [(1991) 4 SCC 139] and Siddharam Satlingappa
Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra [(2011) 1 SCC 694 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 514] .’
112 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
12. Learned counsel summed up his arguments by pointing out that
the Labour Court had rightly noticed Clause 5.5 of the respondent’s
Appointment Letter which starts with “being a managerial cadre
employee you will be………”, which should leave no manner of doubt
that the respondent cannot come within the definition under Section
2(s), ID Act and his post/position was a pure managerial position.
13. Learned counsel submitted that the learned Single Judge has
erroneously relied on Ved Prakash Gupta (supra) to hold that
since there was an absence of power to appoint, dismiss or hold
disciplinary enquiry against other employees, the same indicated
that the respondent did not belong to the managerial capacity as the
observation therein was not a water-proof compartment to hold that
the respondent was a “workman”. Mr Singh urged that the impugned
judgment deserved to be set aside.
SUBMISSIONS BY THE RESPONDENT-IN-PERSON
14. The respondent, who appeared in person, vehemently opposed the
instant appeal. He submitted that the arguments advanced on behalf
of the appellant are without any basis. He submitted that before the
learned Single Judge and the learned Division Bench of the High
Court, he had succeeded in establishing that he was a “workman”
based on the nature of duties performed by him. Further, he contended
that the Labour Court had ignored the fact that there was enough oral
and documentary evidence showing the nature of duties performed
by him, which was ignored in a hyper-technical manner on the
ground that specific pleading that he was a “workman” was missing
in his Statement of Claim. It was his stand that only because of his
designation and salary, it was held that he was not a “workman”
which was an incorrect approach by the Labour Court. He submitted
that the proceedings before the Labour Court do not require strict
compliance of Rules of Evidence, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He canvassed that basically it is
the rules of natural justice which have to prevail. It was further argued
that in the Statement of Claim, the expression “workman” was not
expressly used as he had engaged the services of an advocate to
draft such claim and was also because of inadvertence and sheer
oversight. The respondent urged that the same cannot be held to
be against him as he has mentioned in sufficient detail, the duties
performed by him and nature thereof, which are neither managerial
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 113
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
nor supervisory but, as per him, purely clerical. He reiterated that
the appellant had obtained his resignation under coercion, and he
was removed from his services wrongfully/unlawfully and virtually
at gunpoint. He submitted that the resignation was not out of his
free will as he had pleaded for alternative job/employment with the
appellant and had stated the reason for resignation.
15. It was submitted that the appellant is a telecommunications enterprise
and offers telecom-related products and services to individuals and
entities as also to Government Departments and participates in
government tenders. The respondent stated that the appellant has a
separate division called “Government Vertical Division/Department”
which has to liaison with Government Departments by collecting
information and passing it on to the superior officers/management in
the Company. The Respondent states that he was working in such
vertical division and thus his duties were clerical in nature.
16. Continuing, the respondent stated that he had no decision-making
knowledge, and/or qualification, and/or powers and nobody reported
to him. The stand taken was that to facilitate its employees for having
ease of access to Government Departments, the appellant like many
other private organisations, tactfully gave fanciful and impressive
designations like “Regional Business Head”, “Team Leader”, etc.
without any real power or authority. It was submitted that subsequently,
the appellant did not issue any further Memo or Letter designating
him as “Regional Business Head” or “Team Leader”. He reiterated
that he was not writing any appraisals of any employee and was also
not an “Assessing Manager”. The respondent also tried to indicate
discrepancies in the stand of the appellant before different fora.
17. The respondent, in support of his contentions above, has placed
reliance upon the following pronouncements:

ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:
18. Having carefully considered the facts and circumstances and
submissions of the parties, the Court finds that the Impugned
Judgment as also the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge
cannot be sustained. The moot issue is whether the respondent would
or would not come within the definitional stipulation of a “workman”
as laid out under Section 2(s), ID Act. The same reads as under:
“2(s) “workman” means any person (including an apprentice)
employed in any industry to do any manual, unskilled,
skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory work
for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be
express or implied, and for the purposes of any proceeding
under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute, includes
any such person who has been dismissed, discharged or
retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of, that
dispute, or whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has
led to that dispute, but does not include any such person—
(i) who is subject to the Air Force Act, 1950 (45 of 1950),
or the Army Act, 1950 (46 of 1950), or the Navy Act,
1957 (62 of 1957); or
(ii) who is employed in the police service or as an officer
or other employee of a prison; or
(iii) who is employed mainly in a managerial or
administrative capacity; or
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 115
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
(iv) who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, draws
wages exceeding ten thousand rupees per mensem or
exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached
to the office or by reason of the powers vested in
him, functions mainly of a managerial nature.”
19. The story begins with induction of the respondent into the appellant-
Company on 22.06.2009. Perusal of the Appointment Letter of even
date, which has also been taken note of by the Labour Court, reveals
at the very beginning that the respondent’s appointment was as
“Senior Manager(B2) - Sales” in the Company.
20. Clause 5.5 of the Appointment Letter provides as under:
“Being a managerial cadre employee you will be
responsible for the overall smooth and effective functioning
of the department/ establishment/ office/ staff/ employees
under you charge and will be directly responsible for the
successful and timely completion of any job / work assigned
to you or any person working under your control and
supervision and/ or within the department/ establishment/
office of which you are for the tire being holding the charge
You would adhere to the norms of office discipline. You
would also be responsible to ensure proper and effective
adherence to the norms of office discipline including
working hours, systems and procedures by the staff/
employees working under your supervision and/or In the
department/ office/ establishment under your charge.” [sic]
21. Coupled with the above, Annexure ‘A’ to the Appointment Letter
discloses that the respondent had perks such as Special Allowance,
Car Hiring Charges, Petrol and Maintenance, Driver’s Salary,
Professional Body Membership(s) and Credit Card Reimbursement
etcetera.
22. The fixed pay of the respondent was Rs.13,20,000/- (Rupees Thirteen
Lakhs and Twenty Thousand), whereas the SIP was Rs.8,80,000/-
(Rupees Eight Lakhs and Eighty Thousand), with the total coming
to Rs. 22,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty-Two Lakhs) per annum. In the
orders of the Labour Court, the learned Single Judge and the learned
Division Bench as also the material placed before us in the present
proceedings, it is clear that even prior to joining the appellant-
Company, the respondent, had worked in a managerial capacity
116 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in another organisation7. The respondent himself described his
position as a Member of the senior management cadre, in-charge of
supervising the Account Managers in the four Southern States. Even
the application made by the respondent seeking employment in the
appellant-Company shows that it was for the position of “Head Sales
Operations”. Further, in the said application, relating to professional
experience, he disclosed that he was Regional Manager South –
Graphic Communication Group in Kodak India Private Limited from
June, 2007 till the date of making the application; in Xerox India as
“Corporate Account Relationship Manager”(2005-2007), “Manager
Graphic Arts” (2002-2005) and “Account Manager – Government”
(2000-2002); in Food World Supermarkets Limited as “Assistant
Manager-Operations” (April, 2000-October, 2000) and in STM &
Sterling Resort (I) Limited as “Assistant Manager Sales” (July,
1992–March, 2000).
23. The records also show that the respondent, in fact, performed a
supervisory role over the managers and was the Assessing Manager
of his team, which consisted of Managers in the B-1 & B-2 Levels.
Moreover, after adducing the evidence led by both sides, the Labour
Court vide a detailed order and discussion, has held the respondent
not to be covered under “workman” as per Section 2(s), ID Act. The
learned Single Judge has not appreciated the discussion by the
Labour Court and the available evidence in their true perspective,
relying mainly upon the judgment in Ved Prakash Gupta (supra).
In Paragraph 12 of Ved Prakash Gupta (supra), it was held “…It
must also be remembered that the evidence of both WW1 and MW1
shows that the appellant could never appoint or dismiss any workman
or order any enquiry against any workman. In these circumstances
we hold that the substantial duty of the appellant was only that of
a Security Inspector at the gate of the factory premises and that it
was neither managerial nor supervisory in nature in the sense in
which those terms are understood in industrial law. In the light of
the evidence and the legal position referred to above we are of the
opinion that the finding of the Labour Court that the appellant is not
a workman within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Act is perverse
and could not be supported.”
7 Kodak India Private Limited.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 117
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
24. A bare perusal of the above makes it crystal clear that absence of
power to appoint, dismiss or conduct disciplinary enquiries against
other employees was not the only reason for the Court to conclude
in Ved Prakash Gupta (supra) that the appellant therein was a
“workman”. At this juncture, we may note that although Ved Prakash
Gupta (supra) was decided by a 3-Judge Bench, in a later judgment
by a 2-Judge Bench of this Court in S K Maini v M/s Carona Sahu
Company Limited, (1994) 3 SCC 510, it was held that “…It should
be borne in mind that an employee discharging managerial duties
and functions may not, as a matter of course, be invested with the
power of appointment and discharge of other employees. It is not
unlikely that in a big set-up such power is not invested to a local
manager but such power is given to some superior officers also
in the management cadre at divisional or regional level. …” The
judgment in S K Maini (supra) is innocent of Ved Prakash Gupta
(supra), but we do not find any inconsistency in the statement of law
laid down in S K Maini (supra), given our reading of Ved Prakash
Gupta (supra) as enunciated hereinabove.
25. That being said, in our considered view, mere absence of power to
appoint, dismiss or hold disciplinary inquiries against other employees,
would not and could not be the sole criterion to determine such an
issue. Holding otherwise would lead to incongruous consequences, as
the same would, illustratively, mean that, employees in high-ranking
positions but without powers to appoint, dismiss or hold disciplinary
enquiry would be included under the umbrella of “workman” under
Section 2(s), ID Act. We cannot be oblivious of the impact of our
decisions. In this context, reference to the decision in Shivashakti
Sugars Limited v Shree Renuka Sugar Limited, (2017) 7 SCC
729 is apposite:
“43. It has been recognised for quite some time now that
law is an interdisciplinary subject where interface between
law and other sciences (social sciences as well as natural/
physical sciences) come into play and the impact of other
disciplines on Law is to be necessarily kept in mind while
taking a decision (of course, within the parameters of
legal provisions). Interface between Law and Economics
is much more relevant in today’s time when the country
has ushered into the era of economic liberalisation, which
is also termed as “globalisation” of economy. India is on
118 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the road of economic growth. It has been a developing
economy for number of decades and all efforts are made,
at all levels, to ensure that it becomes a fully developed
economy. Various measures are taken in this behalf by the
policy-makers. The judicial wing, while undertaking the task
of performing its judicial function, is also required to perform
its role in this direction. It calls for an economic analysis
of law approach, most commonly referred to as “Law and
Economics”. In fact, in certain branches of Law there is a
direct impact of Economics and economic considerations
play predominant role, which are even recognised as legal
principles. Monopoly laws (popularly known as “Antitrust
Laws” in USA) have been transformed by Economics. The
issues arising in competition laws (which has replaced
monopoly laws) are decided primarily on economic analysis
of various provisions of the Competition Commission
Act. Similar approach is to be necessarily adopted while
interpreting bankruptcy laws or even matters relating to
corporate finance, etc. The impress of Economics is strong
while examining various facets of the issues arising under
the aforesaid laws. In fact, economic evidence plays a
big role even while deciding environmental issues. There
is a growing role of Economics in contract, labour, tax,
corporate and other laws. Courts are increasingly receptive
to economic arguments while deciding these issues. In
such an environment it becomes the bounden duty of
the Court to have the economic analysis and economic
impact of its decisions.
44.We may hasten to add that it is by no means suggested
that while taking into account these considerations, specific
provisions of law are to be ignored. First duty of the Court
is to decide the case by applying the statutory provisions.
However, on the application of law and while interpreting a
particular provision, economic impact/effect of a decision,
wherever warranted, has to be kept in mind. Likewise, in a
situation where two views are possible or wherever there
is a discretion given to the Court by law, the Court needs
to lean in favour of a particular view which subserves the
economic interest of the nation. Conversely, the Court
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 119
M/S Bharti Airtel Limited v. A.S. Raghavendra
needs to avoid that particular outcome which has a potential
to create an adverse effect on employment, growth of
infrastructure or economy or the revenue of the State. It
is in this context that economic analysis of the impact of
the decision becomes imperative.”
(emphasis supplied)
26. As regards the power of the High Court to re-appraise the facts,
it cannot be said that the same is completely impermissible under
Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. However, there must be a
level of infirmity greater than ordinary in a Tribunal’s order, which is
facing judicial scrutiny before the High Court, to justify interference.
We do not think such a situation prevailed in the present facts.
Further, the ratio of the judgments relied upon by the respondent
in support of his contentions, would not apply in the facts at hand.
27. Though much emphasis was laid by the respondent on his claim
that his resignation was forced, this Court is not persuaded to
accept such a contention, basically on the ground that the language
employed by the respondent in his resignation letter is to the effect
that he was submitting his resignation, which may be approved,
keeping the interest of his family and career and also that with
utmost feeling of humiliation and insult he was submitting such
resignation. It further indicates that over the six months preceding
his resignation, he felt that he had been subjected to unfair rating,
which indicates his disillusionment and dissatisfaction, while working
for the Company. Pausing here, the Court would indicate that a
person, in the employment of any company, cannot dictate terms of
his employment to his employer. He has channels of venting her/his
grievances but ultimately, it is the view of the competent authority
within the organisation that will prevail with regard to his appraisal/
rating. In his resignation letter dated 24.03.2011, the respondent has
further stated that because of being subjected to unfair rating without
any feedback or review, he faced personal and professional insult,
harassment and was left with no option but to submit his resignation,
which was not out of his free will. Again, the Court would indicate
that the phraseology, “not of his free will” would not mean that it was
forced upon him by the Company. Rather, what can be gathered
from the materials on record and the orders of the fora below, is
that the resignation was more out of a sense of being unfairly rated
by the appellant. From the material available, it also transpires that
120 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the respondent had made a complaint to the Ombudsman pertaining
to his unfair rating. Needless to point out, it would be far-fetched for
the Court to assume that the entire organisation i.e., the Company
would be against one individual (the respondent) and that a person
of such high calibre and quality, who could deliver so much to the
Company, would be forced to put in his papers.
28. The respondent asserts that he was one of the best performers and
an asset to the Company. Such being the situation, it is hard to fathom
why all his superiors would have turned against him. On the record,
there is no direct allegation of any bias against or victimisation of
the respondent as he himself has stated as also written to various
persons venting his grievances. Only because things did not turn out
the way the respondent wanted them to, or for that his grievances
were not adequately or appropriately addressed, cannot lead to
the presumption that the resignation was forced upon him by the
Company. One way to label the respondent’s resignation as “forced”
would be to attribute the compulsion to the respondent, rather than
factors relating to the Company and/or its management. In other
words, it can be termed a result of feeling suffocated due to lack of
proper appreciation and not being given his rightful due that led to
the chain of events supra, rather than by way of any arbitrariness or
high-handedness on the part of the appellant. Bearing due regard to
the nature of duties performed by the respondent, we are satisfied

Section 2(s), ID Act.
29. For reasons aforesaid, this appeal succeeds and is, accordingly,
allowed. The impugned judgment as well as the judgment rendered
by the learned Single Judge are set aside. The judgment of the
Labour Court is revived and restored. Ex consequenti, it is held and
declared that the respondent is not a “workman” and thus, reference

not be maintainable. We commend the respondent for his spirited
resistance to the appeal.

stamp duty will be payable on increased share capital – This
is however subject to the maximum, i.e., Rs. 25 lakhs – If
there is no specific provision for charging the increase, then no
stamp duty is payable for any increase in the share capital of a
company – Ceiling of Rs. 25 lakhs is applicable on Articles of
Association and the increased share capital therein, not on every
increase individually – In case stamp duty equivalent to or more
than the cap has already been paid, no further stamp duty can
be levied – Further, argument of the appellant that stamp duty
paid before the 2015 amendment cannot be taken into account,
not agreed with – It is true that the amendment does not have
retrospective effect, however since the instrument ‘Articles of
Association’ remained the same and the increase was initiated
by the respondent after the cap was introduced, the duty already
paid on the same very instrument will have to be considered – It
is not a fresh instrument which had been brought to be stamped,
but only the increase in share capital in the original document,
which was specifically made chargeable by the Legislation –

Sudhanshu Dhulia, J.
1. The State of Maharashtra is in appeal before us challenging the order
of the Division Bench of Bombay High Court dated 18.08.2009, which
has allowed the writ petition of the respondent, while setting aside
the order of the Deputy Superintendent of Stamps, Maharashtra
(appellant no.2).
We have heard learned counsel Mr. Aniruddha Joshi for the
appellants and learned senior counsel Ms. Madhavi Divan for the
respondents.
2. National Organic Chemical India Ltd. (respondent) was incorporated
with an initial share capital of Rs.36 crores. In 1992 it increased its
share capital to Rs. 600 crores and accordingly paid a stamp duty
of Rs.1,12,80,000/- as per Article 10 of Schedule-I of the Bombay
Stamp Act, 1958 (hereinafter “Stamp Act”). At that time, the provision
read as under:
1 2
Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty
10. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION One thousand rupees for
OF A COMPANY – Where the every rupees 5,00,000 or
Company has no share capital or part thereof.
nominal share capital or increased
share capital.
The State of Maharashtra (appellant no.1) on 02.08.1994 amended
Article 10 and introduced a maximum cap of Rs.25 lakhs on stamp
duty which would be payable by a company. The amending notification
is reproduced below in part:
344 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of Section
9 of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 (Born. LX of 1958), the
Government of Maharashtra, having satisfied that it is
necessary to do so in the public interest, hereby reduces,
with effect from the 1st August, 1994, the maximum duty
chargeable on Article of Association of a Company under
Article 10 of Schedule-I to the said Act, to Rs. Twenty
Five Lakhs.”
Subsequently, the respondent passed a resolution for a further
increase in its share capital to Rs.1,200 crores and paid Rs. 25 lakhs
as stamp duty when it filed its Notice in Form No.5,1 pursuant to
Section 97 of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter “Companies Act”).
However, according to the respondent this was done inadvertently
as it was soon realised that stamp duty was not liable to be paid
by them since the maximum stamp duty which was of Rs. 25 lakhs
payable on Articles of Association as per the provisions of the Stamp
Act, had already been paid by them in 1992. Consequently, the
respondent wrote a letter to appellant no.2 seeking a refund of the
payment of Stamp Duty of Rs. 25 lakhs.
This request was turned down by appellant no.2, vide Order dated
20.01.1998 where it was stated that whenever the authorised share
capital of a company is increased, stamp duty is payable on each
such occasion at the time of filing of Form No. 5 and it is not a one
time measure. Aggrieved, the respondent filed a writ petition before
the Bombay High Court challenging the aforesaid order and seeking
refund of Stamp Duty of Rs. 25 lakhs with interest, paid by them
inadvertently.
The Bombay High Court, after hearing the parties, concluded that
Form No.5 is not an instrument as defined by Section 2 of the
Stamp Act and that stamp duty can only be charged on Articles of
Association, where the maximum duty (Rs.25 Lakhs), payable as
per the amendment has already been paid by the respondent. The
High Court allowed the writ petition and directed the appellants to
refund Stamp Duty of Rs.25 lakhs along with interest @ 6% per
annum.
1 Form No. 5 of the Companies (Central Government’s) General Rules & Forms, 1965 is the prescribed
form of notice, which has to be sent under Section 97 of the Companies Act.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 345
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
3. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that a company increases
its share capital by sending a notice in Form No.5 as per Section 97
of the Companies Act. Thus, he contends that every time a company
increases its share capital, it is a separate taxing event and stamp
duty is liable to be paid irrespective of whether the maximum amount
payable under the section has previously been paid.
The learned counsel further relies on Section 14A of the Stamp Act
to contend that any material or substantial alteration in the character
of an instrument requires a fresh stamp duty according to its altered
character.
Finally, it is also contended that the maximum cap or upper ceiling
of Rs. 25 lakhs was introduced after the payment of Stamp Duty of
Rs.1,12,80,000/-. Therefore, the stamp duty paid earlier cannot be
taken into consideration in any case.
4. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent submits
that it is only the Articles of Association of a company which are
chargeable to Stamp Duty under Article 10. Form No.5 which is
being contended by the appellants to be a separate instrument, is
completely alien to the Stamp Act as it serves a very limited purpose
of giving notice to the Registrar that a company has increased its
share capital beyond the authorised share capital.
She would further submit that increase in the share capital of a
company does not materially or substantially alter the character of the
Articles of Association so as to fall within Section 14A of the Stamp
Act. She refers to Section 31 of the Companies Act to submit that
any alterations made to the Articles of Association are valid and are
to be taken as if originally contained therein.
Finally, she relies on a catena of judgements to contend that fiscal
statutes have to be construed strictly and in case of any ambiguity
in the charging provision, the same has to be resolved against the
Department.
5. Let us now examine the relevant provisions of the Stamp Act. Section
3 of the Stamp Act provides that inter alia stamp duty is payable
on instruments which are executed in the State of Maharashtra and
the duty payable is the amount indicated in Schedule-I of the Stamp
Act. The definition of instrument is provided under Section 2(l) of the
Stamp Act, which is reproduced below:
346 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“(l) instrument” includes every document by which any
right or liability is, or purports to be, created, transferred,
limited, extended, extinguished or recorded, but does not
include a bill of exchange, cheque, promissory note, bill
of lading, letter of credit, policy of insurance, transfer of
share, debenture, proxy and receipt.”
6. The first question that we now have to answer is whether the notice
sent to the Registrar in Form No.5 is an “instrument” as defined
under Section 2(l).
Learned counsel for the appellants contends that Form No.5 records
or purports to record the right or extension of the right of a company
to increase its share capital as recorded in its Articles of Association
and thus falls within the definition of an “instrument”.
Share capital of a company refers to the amount invested in the
company for it to carry out its operations while Articles of Association
contain the prescribed rules and regulations that a company adopts
for its internal management.2 When a company is incorporated it has
to present certain documents, including its Articles of Association,
to the Registrar under Section 33 of the Companies Act and if the
Registrar is satisfied that all necessary requirements have been
complied with, he then registers the documents submitted. This is
because of the implication that provisions contained in the articles
amount to a public notice to all those who deal with the company.
7. Section 2(2) of the Companies Act inter alia defines “articles” as the
Articles of Association of a company as originally framed or as altered
from time to time. A company is empowered to alter its Articles of
Association by passing a special resolution in the manner provided
in Section 31 of the Companies Act, which states that:
“31. Alteration of articles by special resolution.— (1)
Subject to the provisions of this Act and to the conditions
contained in its memorandum a company may, by special
resolution, alter its articles:
Provided that no alteration made in the articles under
this sub-section which has the effect of converting a
2 Section 26 of the Companies Act, 1956.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 347
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
public company into a private company, shall have effect
unless such alteration has been approved by the Central
Government.
(2) Any alteration so made shall, subject to the provisions
of this Act, be as valid as if originally contained in the
articles and be subject in like manner to alteration by
special resolution.
(2-A) …
(3) …”
(emphasis supplied)
Any alteration in the share capital of a limited company is provided
under Section 94 of the Companies Act, which reads as under:
“94. Power of limited company to alter its share
capital.— (1) A limited company having a share capital,
may, if so authorised by its articles, alter the conditions of
its memorandum as follows, that is to say, it may—
(a) increase its share capital by such amount as it thinks
expedient by issuing new shares;
(b) …
(c) …
(d) …
(e) …
(2) The powers conferred by this section shall be exercised
by the company in general meeting and shall not require
to be confirmed by the Court.
(3) …”
(emphasis supplied)
A perusal of Section 94 of the Companies Act shows that a company
is empowered to increase its share capital, by such amount as it
thinks expedient, by passing a resolution in a general meeting. It
is pertinent to note that no approval or confirmation by the Court is
required to exercise this power.
348 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Once a resolution for authorising increase in share capital has been
passed in terms of Section 94 of the Companies Act, a notice is required
to be sent by the company in Form No.5 to the Registrar, pursuant to
Section 97 of the Companies Act. The provision is reproduced below:
“97. Notice of increase of share capital or of members.—
(1) Where a company having a share capital, whether its
shares have or have not been converted into stock, has
increased its share capital beyond the authorised capital,
and where a company, not being a company limited by
shares, has increased the number of its members beyond
the registered number, it shall file with the Registrar, notice
of the increase of capital or of members within thirty days
after the passing of the resolution authorising the increase;
and the Registrar shall record the increase and also make
any alterations which may be necessary in the company’s
memorandum or articles or both.
(2) …
(3) …”
(emphasis supplied)
A perusal of the provisions referred above shows that it is the Registrar
who is the custodian of the articles of a company and not the company.
Thus, when a company has to alter the same or modify its share
capital as recorded therein, it has to pass a resolution and file its
Form No. 5. The relevant portion of Form No.5 is reproduced below:
“Notice is hereby given –
1…
2. In accordance with Section 97 of the Companies Act,
1956, that by ordinary resolution / special resolution of the
company dated the day of ______
(i) the authorised share capital of the company has been
increased by the addition thereto of the sum of Rs. ______
beyond the present authorised capital of Rs. ______.
(ii)...
3…
4…”
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 349
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
8. The appellants have relied on Hindustan Lever v. State of
Maharashtra, (2004) 9 SCC 438, and would submit that Form
No.5 is an instrument. In this case, the question whether an order
passed by the Court (under Section 394 read with Section 391 of
the Companies Act), sanctioning a scheme of amalgamation of two
companies is an instrument within the meaning of Section 2(l) of the
Stamp Act, was answered in the affirmative. It was observed that
the Court passes the order of sanction based on the arrangement
arrived at between the parties and thereby affects transfer of assets
and liabilities between them, which binds all. This is what was said:
“32. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that
the order passed by the Court under Section 394 of the
Companies Act is based upon the compromise between two
or more companies. Function of the court while sanctioning
the compromise or arrangement is limited to oversee that
the compromise or arrangement arrived at is lawful and that
the affairs of the company were not conducted in a manner
prejudicial to the interest of its members or to public interest,
that is to say, it should not be unfair or contrary to public
policy or unconscionable. Once these things are satisfied
the scheme has to be sanctioned as per the compromise
arrived at between the parties. It is an instrument which
transfers the properties and would fall within the definition of
Section 2(1) of the Bombay Stamp Act which includes every
document by which any right or liability is transferred…”
The above judgment nowhere states that Form No. 5 is an instrument.
The reliance of the appellant here, on the above judgment, seems
to be misconceived. An order of the Court sanctioning a scheme of
amalgamation cannot be equated to Form No. 5. Any increase in the
share capital by a company is neither required to be confirmed by
the Court in view of Section 94(2), nor does the Registrar exercise
any discretion, provided Form No. 5 is duly filled.
On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent has
relied on New Egerton Woollen Mills, In re, 1899 SCC OnLine
All 22, where the Allahabad High Court was faced with a similar
question; as to whether stamp duty is payable on the document
whereby alterations were made to Articles of Association. A Full
Bench of the High Court (in the context of the Indian Companies
Act, 1882) answered in the negative with the following reasoning:
350 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“... we are satisfied that the document which was submitted
to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies was submitted
to him under s. 79 to be recorded by him, and not, as he
states, for registration. The document was not new articles
of association, or articles of association at all within the
meaning of the Indian Companies Act. It was a copy of
the special resolution passed by the company, notifying
to the Registrar, and through him to the world concerned,
that the regulations of the company, which were covered
by the resolution, would be the regulations by which the
company would in future be bound. These regulations, even
though they were new regulations to the exclusion of all
the existing regulations of the company, are, by the second
paragraph of s. 76, to be deemed to be regulations of the
company of the same validity as if they had been originally
contained in the articles of association. The law does not
say that they are to be deemed articles of association, but
expressly declares that they are to be deemed regulations
of the same validity as if they had been contained in the
articles of association. The document which has been
forwarded to us is certainly not one which falls within art.
8 of sch. I of the Stamp Act of 1879, and is not liable to
stamp-duty as provided by that article.”
9. We agree with the view taken by the Allahabad High Court. Filing of Form
No. 5 is only a method prescribed, whereby “notice” of increase in share
capital or of members of a company has to be sent to the Registrar,
within 30 days of passing of such resolution. The Registrar then has
to record such increase in share capital or members, and carry out the
necessary alterations in the articles. Stamp Duty is affixed on Form No.
5 as a matter of practical convenience because a company itself cannot
carry out the alterations and record the increase in share capital in its
Articles of Association. It is only the articles which are an instrument
within the meaning of Section 2(l) of the Stamp Act and accordingly have
been mentioned in Article 10 of Schedule-I of the Stamp Act.
10. Counsel for the appellants, however, contends that increase in the
share capital of the respondent from Rs. 600 crores to Rs.1,200
crores, materially alters the character of the instrument, i.e., Articles
of Association. As such, it requires a fresh stamp according to its
altered character and needs to be charged as a separate instrument.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 351
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent refers
to Section 31(2) of the Companies Act, which provides that any
alteration of the articles shall, subject to the provisions of this Act,
be valid as if it were originally in the articles. She further submits
that whether an instrument has been materially altered or not is
a question of fact and the appellants have neither taken this plea
while rejecting the request for the refund, nor before the High Court.
11. It is a settled position of law that in case of conflict between two
laws, the general law must give way to the special law. A conjoined
reading of the Stamp Act and the Companies Act would show that
while the former governs the payment of stamp duty for all manner
of instruments, the latter deals with all aspects relating to companies
and other similar associations.
In the case at hand, we are concerned with an instrument which is
chargeable to Stamp Duty and finds its origin in the Companies Act.
The various provisions of the Companies Act provide the purpose and
scope of the instrument. Thus, it has to be said that the Companies Act
is the special law and the Stamp Act is the general law with regards
to Articles of Association, and the special will override the general.
12. A Division Bench of the High Court of Madras in M. Swaminathan
v. Chairman and Managing Director, 1987 SCC OnLine Mad
438 discussed Section 31(2) of the Companies Act and made the
following observations:
“The section cannot be understood to mean that any
alteration made in the Articles of Association would have
retrospective effect as if it was there from the inception
of the Articles of Association. The section is intended
only to confer validity on the alteration made to the
Articles. It is only for the limited purpose of making the
alteration valid it is to be treated as if it was originally
in the Articles. It is seen from Sec. 29 and 30 of the
Companies Act, that certain formalities are prescribed
for Articles of Association. Unless the requirements of
Ss. 29 and 30 are satisfied, the Articles of Association
will not be valid in law. If the same formalities are to be
gone through whenever any alteration is made, it may
lead to several difficulties.”
352 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Section 31(2) was thus introduced with the intention to confer validity
on any alterations to the articles as if they were originally contained
therein. Therefore, any increase in the share capital of the company
also shall be valid as if it were originally there when the Articles of
Association were first stamped. As discussed by the Allahabad High
Court in New Egerton Woollen Mills, In re, (supra) there is no concept
of a company having new Articles of Association. Thus, Section 14A
of the Stamp Act would not be of any help to the appellants.
13. We may here add that the Legislature has specifically mentioned
Articles of Association in Article 10 of Schedule-I of the Stamp Act,
where stamp duty is to be charged inter alia on increase in the share
capital of a company. Thus, in spite of Section 31(2) of the Companies
Act stamp duty will be payable on increased share capital. This is
however subject to the maximum, i.e., Rs. 25 lakhs which we shall
refer to in a while.
If there is no specific provision for charging the increase, then no
stamp duty is payable for any increase in the share capital of a
company. In order to clarify, we may refer to a decision of the Delhi
High Court in S.E. Investments Ltd. v. Union of India, 2011 SCC
OnLine Del 1867. In Delhi, the charging provision of the Indian
Stamp (Delhi Amendment) Act, 2007 which was under consideration
of the High Court was as follows:
10 ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF A COMPANY:-
(a) When the authorized 0.15% of the Authorized
capital of the company share capital with a
does not exceed one lac monetary ceiling of Rs. 25
Lakhs.
(b) In other cases 0.15% of the Authorized
share capital with a
monetary ceiling of Rs. 25
Lakhs.
The Single Judge of the High Court3 observed that other State
Legislatures have included a specific provision for levy of stamp
duty on increase in authorised share capital and held as follows:
3 The judgement of the Single Judge was upheld by the Division Bench in Collector of Stamps v. Se
Investment Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3857.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 353
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
“13. In the absence of a specific provision that permits
the levy of stamp duty on the increase in authorized
share capital, it would not be open to the Respondents
to insist upon the Petitioner having to pay stamp duty for
the increased authorized share capital. The fact that the
Petitioner earlier paid stamp duty when the authorized
share capital was increased to Rs. 8.5 crores cannot act
as an estoppel against the Petitioner.”
14. The second question is whether the maximum cap on stamp duty
is applicable every time there is an increase in the share capital
or it is a one-time measure. It is an admitted fact that when the
respondent increased its share capital from Rs. 36 crores to Rs.
600 crores it paid a stamp duty of Rs.1,12,80,000/- and at that time
there was no provision for a maximum cap or upper ceiling on the
amount payable.
On 02.08.1994, the State Legislature amended Article 10 of Schedule-I
of the Stamp Act and the amended provision, which was applicable
when the respondent passed a resolution to increase its authorised
share capital to Rs. 1200 crores, is reproduced below:
1 2
Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty
10. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION One thousand rupees for
OF A COMPANY – Where the every rupees 5,00,000 or part

share capital.
15. The appellant has relied on Collector of Stamps v. Se Investment
Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3857 to contend that each increase
in authorised share capital will be chargeable to stamp duty in
Maharashtra due to the inclusion of “increased share capital” in the
charging provision and hence, respondent has rightfully paid Rs. 25
lakhs (for the subsequent increase from Rs.600 crores to Rs.1200
crores) as stamp duty in view of the maximum cap.
The Stamp Act authorises involuntary exaction of money and is in the
nature of a fiscal statute, which has to be interpreted strictly. This Court
in CWT v. Ellis Bridge Gymkhana, (1998) 1 SCC 384 held as under:
354 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“5. The rule of construction of a charging section is that
before taxing any person, it must be shown that he falls
within the ambit of the charging section by clear words
used in the section. No one can be taxed by implication.
A charging section has to be construed strictly. If a person
has not been brought within the ambit of the charging
section by clear words, he cannot be taxed at all.”
Thus, even though “increased share capital” is a part of Article 10,
which column it has been placed in assumes importance. Column
1 of the Schedule describes the instrument on which stamp duty is
to be levied whereas Column 2 prescribes the stamp duty payable.
Column 1 has to be construed as describing three situations or
contingencies relating to Articles of Association, i.e., “where the
company has no share capital or nominal share capital or increased
share capital”. In cases where a company has no share capital it
would have to pay no stamp duty and if a company is submitting
its articles for the first time, stamp duty would be calculated as per
the nominal share capital. The effect of adding “increased share
capital” is that stamp duty will be charged on subsequent increases
in the authorised share capital, subject to the maximum cap. In
other words, the ceiling of Rs. 25 lakhs in Column 2 is applicable
on Articles of Association and the increased share capital therein,
not on every increase individually. In case stamp duty equivalent
to or more than the cap has already been paid, no further stamp
duty can be levied. For a better understanding, let us consider a
hypothetical example:
SHARE STAMP STAMP DUTY TO TOTAL
CAPITAL OF A DUTY BE ACTUALLY PAID STAMP
COMPANY PAYABLE DUE TO CAP DUTY
50 crores 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 10 lakhs
100 crores 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 20 lakhs
150 crores 10 lakhs 5 lakhs 25 lakhs
200 crores 10 lakhs Nil 25 lakhs
16. The fact that the maximum cap of Rs.25 lakhs would be applicable
as a one-time measure and not on each subsequent increase in the
share capital of a company is fortified directly by the Maharashtra
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 355
State of Maharashtra & Anr. v.
National Organic Chemical Industries Ltd.
Stamp (Amendment) Act, 2015 which amended the charging section
for Articles of Association i.e., Article 10 of the Stamp Act. The Section
as it stands now is reproduced below:
1 2
Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty
10. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION [0.2 per cent. on share capital
OF A COMPANY – Where the or increased share capital,

share capital.
The effect of the 2015 amendment is that “increased share capital”
has also been added in Column 2 and proper stamp duty shall be
calculated, for either of the three situations, as per the share capital
or increased share capital. This means that the cap will now be
applicable on each individual increase.
17. A reference can also be made to the provisions of Stamp Duty
Acts of a few other States where Articles of Association are
chargeable:

a maximum of twenty five

18. We also do not agree with the appellant that stamp duty paid before
the amendment cannot be taken into account. It is true that the
amendment does not have retrospective effect, however since the
instrument ‘Articles of Association’ remains the same and the increase
was initiated by the respondent after the cap was introduced, the duty
already paid on the same very instrument will have to be considered.
It is not a fresh instrument which has been brought to be stamped,
but only the increase in share capital in the original document, which
has been specifically made chargeable by the Legislation.
19. For the reasons stated above, we dismiss this civil appeal and uphold
the order of the High Court of Bombay. Accordingly, we direct the
appellants to refund Rs. 25 lakhs paid by the respondent along with
interest @ 6% per annum. Let the needful be done within 6 weeks
from today.
20. Interim order(s) shall stand vacated. Pending application(s), if any,
shall stand disposed of.

(Civil Appeal No. 1121 of 2016)
30 April 2024
[Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan,* JJ.]","The issue for consideration is whether an activity of re-labelling of
goods i.e. cocoa butter and cocoa powder, by affixing additional
labels on both the sides of the packs containing goods, amounts
to “manufacture” in terms of Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central
Excise Tariff Act, 1985, for availing the CENVAT Credit and rebate
on the duty paid while exporting the said goods.
","Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 – Note 3 to Chapter 18 – Cocoa
and Cocoa preparations – Whether re-labelling amounts to
‘manufacture’ as per Section 2(f) of the Act – Explained:
Held: Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985
(post amendment), which deals with Cocoa and Cocoa Preparations
contemplates that if any of the three processes are satisfied, then
the activity shall amount to ‘manufacture’, viz., (i) labelling or re-
labelling of containers; or (ii) repacking from bulk packs to retail
packs; or (iii) the adoption of any other treatment to render the
product marketable to the consumer – In the present case, while
upholding the decision of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax
Appellate Tribunal, it was held that the activity carried out by the
Respondent of relabelling on both sides of the packs containing
the goods and thereafter, introducing in the market or sending it
for export, amounts to ‘manufacture’ in terms of Note 3 to Chapter
18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. [Para 13.3, 15]

the words ‘or’ by ‘and’ – Interpretation of:
Held: By way of the amendment in 2008, the word ‘and’ was replaced

constitute manufacture should either be labelling or re-labelling of
containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs – This process
was construed to be one whole – In other words, the activity should
not only include labelling or re-labelling of containers but the same
should relate to repacking from bulk packs to retail packs – This was
one activity – However, after the amendment i.e. post 01.03.2008,
Note 3 has undergone a change – Now because of substitution of
the word ‘or’ in place of the word ‘and’ between the two expressions
‘labelling or re-labelling of containers’ and ‘repacking from bulk packs
to retail packs’, the earlier composite process of labelling or re-labelling
of containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs has been
split up into two independent processes – Labelling or re-labelling
of containers is one process and repacking from bulk packs to retail
packs has now become another process – Therefore, instead of two
activities, Note 3 now contemplates three activities – The composite
activity of labelling or re-labelling of containers and repacking from
bulk packs to retail packs has been split up into two activities i.e.
labelling or re-labelling of containers is one and the other is repacking
from bulk packs to retail packs. [Paras 13.2, 13.3]

2. Issue raised in the present batch of appeals is identical. Therefore,
the civil appeals were heard together and are being disposed by
this common judgment and order.
3. However, Civil Appeal No. 1121 of 2016 was argued as the lead
appeal. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, we would refer to
the facts of this appeal.
4. This is an appeal by the revenue under Section 35L (1)(b) of the
Central Excise Act, 1944 (referred to hereinafter as ‘the Central
Excise Act’) against the order dated 16.04.2015 passed by the
Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, West Zonal
Bench at Mumbai (briefly ‘CESTAT’ hereinafter) in Appeal No.
E/86389/13-Mum. (Jindal Drugs Limited Vs. Commissioner of Central
Excise, Belapur).
4.1. By the impugned order dated 16.04.2015, CESTAT has allowed
the appeal filed by the respondent holding that as per Note 3
to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (referred
to hereinafter as ‘the Central Excise Tariff Act’), the activity of
labelling amounted to manufacture and hence the activity of the
respondent fell within the ambit of the definition of manufacture
as per the said Note. Therefore, the respondent was eligible for
availing the cenvat credit of the duty paid by its Jammu unit and
was also eligible for rebate on the duty paid by it while exporting
its goods. CESTAT further held that there was no suppression by
the respondent and, therefore, the extended period of limitation
was not available to the department (revenue).
5. Though facts lie within a narrow compass, nonetheless it is necessary
to make a brief reference to the relevant facts for a proper perspective.
274 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
5.1. Respondent is engaged in the business of exporting cocoa
butter and cocoa powder. Its factory at Jammu manufactures
cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Respondent has another unit
located at Taloja in the State of Maharashtra. Cocoa butter
and cocoa powder manufactured at Jammu are received by
the respondent’s unit at Taloja. In the Taloja unit, respondent
affixed two labels on two sides of the packages of the said
goods received from its Jammu factory and cleared the same
for export on payment of duty and claimed rebate of the duty
paid on the exported goods. Further, respondent availed
cenvat credit of the duty paid on those two goods at the time
of clearance from Jammu. Respondent also imported cocoa
butter and cocoa powder from China and Malaysia, receiving
the same in its factory at Taloja.
5.2. The factory of the respondent at Taloja was visited by officials
of the appellant and it was found that the respondent was only
putting labels on the goods brought from Jammu as well as on
the imported goods. As the labels were already fixed on the
boxes containing the two goods, additional labels affixed by
the respondent did not amount to manufacture since affixing of
additional label did not enhance the marketability of the goods
which were already marketable.
5.3. In such circumstances, appellant issued show cause cum
demand notice dated 09.10.2012 to the respondent to show
cause as to why the activity of labelling undertaken by the
respondent on the product cocoa butter received from the
Jammu unit and also on the imported goods should not be held
as activities not amounting to manufacture in terms of Note 3
to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act. It was alleged
that respondent had wrongly availed cenvat credit amounting
to Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 for the period from June, 2008 to July,
2012 which should not be demanded and recovered under Rule
14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11A(1) of the
Central Excise Act (since renumbered as Section 11A (4) of the
Central Excise Act with effect from 08.04.2011). It was further
alleged that rebate claims amounting to Rs. 13,22,30,368.00
for the period from June, 2008 to July, 2011, were erroneously
sanctioned and utilised by the respondent which should not be
demanded and recovered under Section 11A(1) of the Central
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 275
Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd.
Excise Act (since renumbered as Section 11A(4) of the Central
Excise Act with effect from 08.04.2011). Respondent was also
called upon to show cause as to why interest at the appropriate
rate on the cenvat credit wrongly availed of and utilised as
determined and demanded should not be recovered from it
under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules,
2004 read with Section 11AB of the Central Excise Act (now
Section 11AA of the said Act with effect from 08.04.2011).
5.4. Respondent submitted written reply dated 08.02.2013 denying
all the allegations made in the show cause notice.
5.5. Following adjudication, the appellant vide the order in original
dated 25.02.2013 held that cocoa butter received by the
respondent at its Taloja unit from its unit at Jammu as well as
the imported cocoa butter were already packed in corrugated
boxes of 25Kg each. The exported cocoa butter was also in
corrugated boxes of 25Kg each. Hence no repackaging activity
was undertaken either on the goods received from the Jammu
unit or on the imported cocoa butter. Appellant further held that
the goods received from the Jammu unit already contained a
label. On receipt of the goods at Taloja, two more labels on two
sides of the carton were affixed. Appellant concluded that it was
a case of additional labelling and not relabelling. Therefore, such
labelling at Taloja did not amount to manufacture. After holding
that Rule 3 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 (hereinafter referred
to as ‘the Cenvat Credit Rules’) allows cenvat credit only in a
case where the process undertaken amounts to manufacture,
respondent held that the process of labelling undertaken by the
respondent in its unit at Taloja did not amount to manufacture.
Therefore, the cenvat credit availed of by the respondent was
contrary to Rule 3 of the Cenvat Credit Rules. Hence, the
credit of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 availed of by it was irregular
which was liable to be recovered under Rule 14 of the Cenvat
Credit Rules read with Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise
Act. Further, appellant held that the respondent had already
utilised part of the irregular credit availed of and claimed rebate
of Rs. 13,22,30,368.00 during the period from June, 2008 to
July, 2012. As the credit availed of was irregular, the rebate
sanctioned was erroneous since the respondent was not entitled
to take the credit and to utilize the same. Therefore, it was held
276 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the erroneous refund of Rs. 13,22,60,368.00 was liable
to be recovered on which the respondent was also liable to
pay interest under Section 11AB/Section 11AA of the Central
Excise Act. Proceeding further, appellant held that respondent
had suppressed the information from the department that it
was only undertaking labelling activity at its Taloja unit which
did not amount to manufacture. Thus, with the intention to avail
irregular credit, respondent had suppressed the information
and claimed that the process undertaken by its unit at Taloja
amounted to manufacture. Therefore, there was suppression
of material fact with the intent to avail irregular credit. Hence,
the respondent was held liable to pay penalty equivalent to
the irregular credit availed of under Rule 15(2) of the Cenvat
Credit Rules read with Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act.
Thereafter, appellant passed the following order:
1. credit of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 (Rupees twenty three crores
two lakhs fifty three thousand seven hundred fifty two
only) was wrongly availed and therefore demanded under
provisions of Rule 14 of Cenvat Credit Rules read with
Section 11A(4) (erstwhile Section 11A(1) of the Central
Excise Act.
2. rebate of Rs. 13,22,30,368.00 (Rupees thirteen crores
twenty two lakhs thirty thousand three hundred sixty
eight only) sanctioned during the period from June 2008
to July 2012 was erroneous as the duty on the exported
goods were paid by utilizing the regularly availed credit
which was not eligible to the assessee. Hence, the same
was demanded under Section 11A(1)/Section 11A(4) of
Central Excise Act.
3. interest at the appropriate rate under Rule 14 of the Cenvat
Credit Rules read with Section 11AA (erstwhile Section
11AB) of the Central Excise Act, was demanded on the
irregular credit availed/erroneous rebate sanctioned.
4. penalty of Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 (Rupees twenty three
crores two lakhs fifty three thousand seven hundred fifty
two only) under the provisions of Rule 15(2) of Cenvat
Credit Rules read with Section 11AC(1)(a) of the Central
Excise Act was imposed. However, the penalty would be
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 277
Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd.
reduced to 25% of the above amount if the assessee paid
the duty determined along with interest within 30 days of
receipt of the order. The reduced penalty of 25% of the
amount of duty so determined would be available to the
assessee only if the 25% of the penalty was also paid
within the period of thirty days of receipt of the order.
Otherwise, the penalty imposed under Section 11AC(1)
(a) equal to the duty amount would remain.
5.6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order in original passed by the
appellant, respondent preferred appeal before the CESTAT.
After hearing the matter, both Judicial Member and Technical
Member passed separate orders on 05.01.2015.
5.7. In his order, the Judicial Member recorded that the respondent
after clearing the goods in its Jammu unit, received the same in
its factory at Taloja and claimed the benefit of notification No.
56/2002-CE(NT) dated 14.11.2002. As per the said notification,
the Jammu unit was entitled to refund of the duty paid whereas
the Taloja unit was also entitled to avail cenvat credit of the
duty paid by the Jammu unit. Judicial Member noted that after
receiving the goods at Taloja, respondent affixed two labels on
the packages on two different sides and thereafter exported the
goods. After referring to the show cause cum demand notice,
the Judicial Member opined that the only issue for consideration
was whether the labelling/re-labelling or putting additional labels
on the containers in the Taloja unit amounted to manufacture
in terms of Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff
Act. As per Note 3, in relation to products of Chapter 18,
labelling or re-labelling of containers or repacking from bulk
packs to retail packs or the adoption of any other treatment to
render a product marketable to the consumer shall amount to
manufacture. Judicial Member opined that all the three activities
are independent and separate. Note 3 to Chapter 18 is a deeming
provision whereby the processes mentioned therein, if carried
out, would amount to manufacture though there may not be any
actual manufacture. In the above context, the Judicial Member
held that activities of labelling or re-labelling of containers without
enhancing marketability amounted to manufacture. A reading
of Note 3 would clearly indicate that the activity of labelling
or re-labelling of the containers amounted to manufacture.
278 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Thereafter, it was held that both the Jammu unit and the Taloja
unit of the respondent are separate units. Therefore, it could
not be said that respondent was availing double benefit. The
Taloja unit had rightly availed the cenvat credit of the duty
paid at Jammu as well as the countervailing duty paid for the
imported goods. Consequently, the rebate claim was correctly
sanctioned to the respondent. Therefore, the respondent had
rightly availed of the cenvat credit. Since the issue, whether the
activity of labelling or re-labelling amounted to manufacture as
per Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act was
related to interpretation of a statutory provision, question of any
suppression or misrepresentation of fact by the respondent did
not arise. Hence, question of getting the benefit of any extended
period of limitation by the appellant for issuing show cause cum
demand notice and thereafter passing adjudication order did
not arise. In the above background, the Judicial Member set
aside the order in original dated 25.02.2013.
5.8. However, the Technical Member did not agree with the view
taken by the Judicial Member. He held that no manufacture had
taken place in the Taloja unit of the respondent both in respect
of the goods manufactured at Jammu as well as the imported
goods. He further held that the activity of the respondent in
bringing the goods from Jammu to Taloja and thereafter to
affix labels so as to avail the benefit of Note 3 to Chapter 18
was not known to the department. Therefore, it was a case
of misrepresentation of facts with the intent to avail rebate
fraudulently. Consequently, the extended period of limitation
was available to the department. That being the position, the
Technical Member was of the view that the order in original was
justified on all counts and dismissed the appeal.
5.9. In view of the difference of opinion between the Judicial Member
and the Technical Member, the matter was placed before the
President of CESTAT to nominate a third member to resolve
the same.
5.10. Thereafter, pursuant to the order passed by the President,
the matter was placed before the third member to resolve the
difference of opinion between the Judicial Member and the
Technical Member.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 279
Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd.
5.11. After hearing the matter, the third member passed the order
dated 16.04.2015. Referring to Note 3 to Chapter 18, both prior
to 01.03.2008 and post 01.03.2008, the third member noted that
Parliament has consciously substituted the word ‘or’ in place of
‘and’ appearing between the words ‘labelling or re-labelling of
containers’ and ‘repacking from bulk packs to retail packs’ to
widen the scope of Note 3. According to the third member, any
one of the three activities referred to in Note 3 i.e. (i) labelling
or re-labelling, (ii) packing or repacking from bulk and retail
packing and (iii) adoption of any other treatment to render a
product marketable would be deemed to be manufacture. He
held that the activity undertaken by the respondent at its Taloja
unit i.e. labelling amounted to manufacture. He negated the
stand of the revenue that labelling or re-labelling should enhance
marketability of the goods as contrary to the plain reading of Note
3. He, therefore, agreed with the Judicial Member that the activity
of labelling undertaken by the respondent is covered by Note 3
to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act which amounts to
manufacture. Further, he also recorded a finding of fact based
on the evidence on record that respondent had repacked the
imported cocoa butter in new cartons and exported them after
labelling. He thus fully concurred with the view expressed by
the Judicial Member that the activity of labelling undertaken by
the respondent amounted to manufacture in terms of Note 3 to
Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act. He also concurred
with the view expressed by the Judicial Member that there was
no suppression or misrepresentation of material fact by the
respondent. Therefore, the extended period was not available
to the revenue. He further held that the respondent is entitled
to the credit of the duty paid on the goods received from the
Jammu unit as well as credit of the countervailing duty paid on
the imported goods. That being the position, he held that the
credit and the rebate were rightly availed of by the respondent.
Question of refund of the same did not arise. Further, no penalty
can be imposed on the respondent.
5.12. Following the opinion rendered by the third member, the matter
was placed before the two-member Bench of CESTAT. In view
of the majority decision, the appeal filed by the respondent was
allowed vide the order dated 16.04.2015.
280 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
6. This Court by the order dated 08.02.2016 had issued notice.
Thereafter, the appeal was admitted on 18.11.2019.
7. Respondent has filed counter affidavit supporting the order of CESTAT
and has sought for dismissal of the appeal. In response thereto,
appellant has filed rejoinder affidavit reiterating the grounds urged
in the appeal.
8. Learned counsel for the appellant has laid great emphasis on the
fact that the activity undertaken by the respondent at its Taloja unit
i.e. putting labels on the two sides of the cartons which were already
labelled at Jammu, cannot be said to be a manufacturing activity. Note
3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise and Tariff Act cannot be read in
a manner to hold that the activity of labelling amounted to manufacture.
Learned counsel, therefore, contended that appellant was fully justified
in passing the order in original. CESTAT was divided in its opinion
as to whether such an activity could be termed as manufacture. The
Technical Member had given good reasons as to why such an activity
cannot be called manufacture while differing from the view taken by
the Judicial Member. The third member has erred in concurring with
the view taken by the Judicial Member. He, therefore, submits that the
order passed by the CESTAT by way of majority should be interfered
with and order in original should be restored.
9. Mr. V. Sridharan, learned senior counsel in his brief submission
referred to Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act,
both prior to its amendment with effect from 01.03.2008 and post
amendment. According to him, Parliament has consciously replaced
the word ‘and’ by the word ‘or’ and post amendment, it is clear that
the activity of labelling or re-labelling amounted to manufacture. He,
therefore, supports the decision of the CESTAT and seeks dismissal
of the appeal.
10. Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have received
the due consideration of the Court.
11. The core issue to be considered is whether the activity of labelling
carried out by the respondent amounts to manufacture? While
contention of the appellant is that the same does not amount to
manufacture, on the other hand according to the respondent, as
per Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, the above
activity amounts to manufacture.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 281
Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd.
12. The Central Excise Act which has since got subsumed in the Central
Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 was enacted to provide for levy
of central duties of excise on goods manufactured or produced in
India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
12.1. Section 2 is the definition clause. ‘Manufacture’ is defined in
Section 2(f) which reads as follows:
“manufacture” includes any process,-
(i) incidental or ancillary to the completion of a
manufactured product;
(ii) which is specified in relation to any goods in the
Section or Chapter notes of the First Schedule to the
Central Excise Tariff Act (5 of 1986) as amounting
to manufacture; or
(iii) which, in relation to the goods specified in the Third
Schedule, involves packing or repacking of such
goods in a unit container or labelling or re-labelling
of containers including the declaration or alteration of
retail sale price on it or adoption of any other treatment
on the goods to render the product marketable to
the consumer,
and the word “manufacturer” shall be construed
accordingly and shall include not only a person who
employs hired labour in the production or manufacture
of excisable goods, but also any person who engages
in their production or manufacture on his own account;
12.2. Therefore, the word ‘manufacture’ includes any process which
is incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufacture
product; any process which is specified in relation to any goods
in the Section or Chapter notes of the First Schedule to the
Central Excise Tariff Act as amounting to manufacture; or any
process which in relation to the goods specified in the Third
Schedule involves packing or repacking of such goods in a unit
container or labelling or re-labelling of containers including the
declaration or alteration of retail sale price on it or adoption
of any other treatment on the goods to render the product
marketable to the consumer.

13. Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act deals with cocoa and cocoa
preparations. Note 3 to Chapter 18 has undergone amendment with
effect from 01.03.2008. Prior to the amendment, Note 3 to Chapter
18 read as under:
In relation to products of this Chapter, labelling or re-labelling of
containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs or the
adoption of any other treatment to render the product marketable
to the consumer, shall amount to ‘manufacture’.
13.1. Post 01.03.2008, Note 3 now reads as follows:
In relation to products of this Chapter, labelling or re-labelling of
containers or repacking from bulk packs to retail packs or the
adoption of any other treatment to render the product marketable
to the consumer, shall amount to ‘manufacture’.
13.2. Thus by way of the amendment, the word ‘and’ has been
replaced by the word ‘or’ between the expressions ‘labelling
or re-labelling of containers’ and ‘repacking from bulk packs
to retail packs’. Prior to 01.03.2008, the legislative intent was
quite clear. The process to constitute manufacture should either
be labelling or re-labelling of containers and repacking from
bulk packs to retail packs. This process was construed to be
one whole. In other words, the activity should not only include
labelling or re-labelling of containers but the same should relate
to repacking from bulk packs to retail packs. This was one
activity. The other activity was adoption of any other treatment
to render the product marketable to the consumer. Therefore,
the legislature was quite clear that if either of the two processes
were followed, the same would amount to manufacture.
13.3. However, after the amendment i.e. post 01.03.2008, Note 3
has undergone a change as indicated above. Now because of
substitution of the word ‘or’ in place of the word ‘and’ between
the two expressions ‘labelling or re-labelling of containers’ and
‘repacking from bulk packs to retail packs’, the earlier composite
process of labelling or re-labelling of containers and repacking
from bulk packs to retail packs has been split up into two
independent processes. Labelling or re-labelling of containers
is one process and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs
has now become another process. Therefore, instead of two
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 283
Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd.
activities, Note 3 now contemplates three activities. As pointed
out above, the composite activity of labelling or re-labelling of
containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs has
been split up into two activities i.e. labelling or re-labelling of
containers is one and the other is repacking from bulk packs to
retail packs. The other activity of adopting any other treatment
to render the product marketable to the consumers remains the
same. Therefore, Note 3, post amendment, as it exists today
contemplates three different processes; if either of the three
processes are satisfied, the same would amount to manufacture.
The three processes are:
(i) labelling or re-labelling of containers; or
(ii) repacking from bulk packs to retail packs; or
(iii) the adoption of any other treatment to render the product
marketable to the consumer.
13.4. As already observed above, if any one of the above three
processes is satisfied then the same would amount to
manufacture.
14. We have already noticed the definition of ‘manufacture’ in the Central
Excise Act. Any one of the processes indicated in Note 3 to Chapter
18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act would come within the ambit of
the definition of ‘manufacture’ under Section 2(f)(ii) of the Central
Excise Act.
15. There is no factual dispute as to the activity carried out by the
respondent at its Taloja unit. Whether the goods are brought from
the Jammu unit or are imported, those are relabelled on both sides
of the packs containing the goods at the Taloja unit of the respondent
and thereafter, introduced in the market or sent for export. In terms
of Note 3 to Chapter 18, this process of re-labelling amounts to
‘manufacture’.
16. That being the position, we are of the considered opinion that the
view taken by CESTAT is the correct one and no case for interference
is made out. This is because all the other aspects are related and
hinges upon the core issue. Resultantly, the impugned order of
CESTAT dated 16.04.2015 is affirmed and the appeal by the revenue
is dismissed.

17. In view of the above decision, Civil Appeal Nos. 788-790 of 2022

Vikram Nath, J.
1. The present appeal assails the correctness of the judgment and
order dated 09.03.2010 passed by the High Court of Punjab &
Haryana at Chandigarh in R.S.A No. 250 of 1983, whereby the High
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 613
Ujagar Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Anr. v. Punjab State & Ors.
Court set aside the judgment and decree dated 25.9.1982 of the
Additional District Judge, Hoshiarpur. The High Court held that the
Civil Court’s jurisdiction was barred under Section 21 of the Punjab
Land Reforms Act, 19721.
2. The background of this case is as follows:
2.1 The appellants, followers of the religious shrine of Dam Dama
Baba Sahib Singh of Una, filed a suit for declaration and
perpetual injunction against the respondents and one Smt.
Sangeet Kaur, daughter of Baba Madhusudan Singh Sahib Una.
The appellants contended that the land detailed in the headnote
of the plaint was dedicated to the religious and charitable
institution Dam Dama Sahib of Una, under the management
and supervision of Baba Madhusudan Singh.
2.2 The appellants pleaded that the shrine was worshipped by them
and countless Sikhs. They asserted that Shri Kala Dhari, the
founder of Una and a descendant of Baba Nanak, established
the shrine, which was later managed by his successors. Shri
Sahib Singh, the successor of Shri Kala Dhari, established
another shrine at Quilla Jawahar Singh in Gujranwala (now in
Pakistan), where followers gifted land for religious and charitable
purposes. The income from these lands was used for maintaining
the shrine and other charitable activities.
2.3 Upon the partition of India, 1440 kanals and 8 marlas of land
were allotted to the Bedi families of Una in lieu of their land in
Pakistan, including 735 kanals and 7 marlas allotted to Tikka
Devinder Singh, a descendant of Baba Sahib Singh. The
appellants argued that this land, though recorded in the name
of Tikka Devinder Singh, was actually meant for the shrine and
managed by Baba Madhusudan Singh.
2.4 The appellants claimed that despite not having the right to
transfer the land, Baba Madhusudan Singh transferred 156
kanals and 8 marlas to the Agriculture Department of Punjab
and 330 kanals and 14 marlas to his daughter, Sangeet Kaur.
These transfers, the appellants contended, were illegal and not
binding on the worshippers of the shrine.
1 In short, the “Land Reforms Act”
614 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
2.5 The Government of Punjab initiated proceedings to declare
part of this land as surplus. The Collector, Agrarian, Hoshiarpur,
declared 20.0943 standard acres of the land as surplus on
28.06.1976. The appellants filed a suit for declaration and
perpetual injunction, asserting that the land was of religious and
charitable nature, and thus exempt under the Land Reforms
Act. They sought a declaration that the land belonged to Dam
Dama Sahib of Una and an injunction to prevent the respondents
from transferring or declaring it surplus.
2.6 The Trial Court framed several issues for determination, including
whether the Civil Court had jurisdiction to try the suit under
Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act. The Trial Court noted that
the issue of jurisdiction was not pressed by the defendants
during the proceedings and, regardless, decided it in favour
of the plaintiffs. After considering the evidence, the Trial Court
dismissed the suit on 15.12.1980, holding that the appellants
failed to prove that the land was dedicated to a religious and
charitable institution.
2.7 Aggrieved by the dismissal, the appellants filed an appeal before
the Additional District Judge, Hoshiarpur. The First Appellate
Court, by judgment and decree dated 25.09.1982, partly allowed
the appeal. The Appellate Court concluded that 133/290 share
of the land in the suit was charitable and belonged to Dam
Dama Baba Sahib Singh of Una. The court held that this share
could not be declared surplus by the Collector and restrained
the respondents from making further transfers of this share of
the land.
3. The respondents, dissatisfied with the First Appellate Court’s
judgment, filed a Regular Second Appeal before the High Court of
Punjab & Haryana. The High Court, vide its order dated 09.03.2010,
set aside the judgment and decree of the Additional District Judge,
holding that the Civil Court’s jurisdiction was barred under Section
21 of the Land Reforms Act. The High Court emphasized that the
appellants had not challenged the order declaring the land surplus
before the appropriate authorities under the Act, and thus, the suit
was not maintainable. The same has been challenged giving rise
to the present appeal.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 615
Ujagar Singh (Dead) Thr. Lrs. & Anr. v. Punjab State & Ors.
4. Having heard the arguments of both sides, this Court is of the opinion
that the High Court fell in error in dismissing the suit primarily on
the ground that the Civil Court’s jurisdiction was barred by Section
21 of the Land Reforms Act.
5. It is pertinent to note that the issue of jurisdiction was not pressed by
the respondents during the Trial Court proceedings. The Trial Court
specifically recorded that the issue of jurisdiction was not pressed
and decided it in favour of the plaintiffs. The respondents did not
challenge this finding in the First Appellate Court, and hence, they
were precluded from raising it in the second appeal before the High
Court.
6. Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act reads as follows:
“21. Bar of jurisdiction.
(1) Save as provided by or under this Act, the validity of
any proceedings or order taken or made under this Act
shall not be called in question in any court or before any
other authority.
(2) No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any
suit, or proceed with any suit instituted after the appointed
day, for specific performance of a contract for transfer of
land which affects the right of the State Government to
the surplus area under this Act.”
7. Section 21 of the Land Reforms Act bars the jurisdiction of Civil Courts
only in specific circumstances: (a) suits for specific performance of
a contract for transfer of land, and (b) questioning the validity of any
proceeding or order taken or made under the Act. The present suit
does not fall under either of these two categories. The appellants’
suit was essentially for a declaration that the land belonged to the
religious and charitable shrine Dam Dama Sahib, and there was no
challenge to the validity of any order under the Act. The Civil Court
alone has the jurisdiction to decide and declare whether the land
belonged to the religious shrine or to Tikka Devinder Singh in his
personal capacity. The suit filed by the appellants was not a challenge
to the validity of the surplus order but a suit for declaration regarding
the ownership of the land.
616 [2024] 7 S.C.R.

8. In view of the above, the High Court’s order is set aside. The matter
is remitted back to the High Court for fresh consideration on merits
in accordance with law.
9. The appeal is accordingly allowed as above.
10. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

this Court (two-judge Bench) was justified in restoring the arbitral
award which had been set aside by the Division Bench of the
High Court on the ground that it suffered from patently illegality.
","Curative Petition – Curative Jurisdiction may be invoked if
there is a miscarriage of justice:
Held: The Supreme Court laid down an overarching principle in
Rupa Hurra v. Ashok Hurra [2002] 2 SCR 1006 that the Court may
entertain a curative petition to (i) prevent abuse of its process; and
(ii) to cure a gross miscarriage of justice – The enumeration of
the situations in which the curative jurisdiction can be exercised
is not intended to be exhaustive – The Court went on to lay down
certain procedural requirements to entertain a curative petition

requirements. [Paras 33 and 34]

interference of courts with arbitral awards:
Held: Section 34 of the Arbitration Act delineates the grounds for
setting aside an arbitral award – In addition to the grounds on
which an arbitral award can be assailed laid down in section 34(2),
there is another ground for challenge against domestic awards,

Court finds that it is vitiated by ‘patent illegality’ appearing on the
face of the award. [Paras 36, 37]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 – s.34 – Setting aside
of domestic award – Ground of patent illegality:
Held: The ground of patent illegality is available for setting aside
a domestic award, if the decision of the arbitrator is found to be
perverse, or so irrational that no reasonable person would have
arrived at it; or the construction of the contract is such that no fair
or reasonable person would take; or, that the view of the arbitrator
is not even a possible view – A ‘finding’ based on no evidence
at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its
decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside under the
head of ‘patent illegality’ – An award without reasons would suffer
from patent illegality – The arbitrator commits a patent illegality by
deciding a matter not within his jurisdiction or violating a fundamental
principle of natural justice. [Para 40]

Held: In the statutory scheme of the Arbitration Act, a recourse to
s.37 is the only appellate remedy available against a decision u/s.

system – Dispute arose between the parties – DAMEPL
alleged that the line was unsafe to operate – Operations were
stopped – DAMEPL issued a notice to DMRC listing defects
attributable to faulty construction and deficient designs
which affected project safety – DMRC was requested to
cure the defects within 90 days from the date of this notice
– Thereafter, DAMPEL issued another notice terminating the
2008 agreement as defects were not cured within 90 days –
Arbitral Tribunal passed award in favour of DAMPEL – Single
Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition filed u/s. 34
of 1996 Act – Division Bench of the High Court allowed the
appeal u/s. 37 of 1996 Act in part – DAMEPL moved a SLP
u/Art. 136 of the Constitution – A two-judge bench of the
Supreme Court allowed the appeal, and restored the award
– Correctness:
Held: Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety (CMRS), after inquiry
and inspection had issued sanction for running of the metro line
– In the instant case, the Division Bench of the High Court found
the award to be perverse, irrational and patently illegal since it
ignored the vital evidence of CMRS certification in deciding the
validity of termination – It underlined the significance of the CMRS
sanction under the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance)
Act, 2002 – Also, clause 29.5.1(i) of the 2008 agreement entitles
the concessionaire to terminate the agreement if DMRC “failed to
cure such breach or take effective steps for curing such breach”
within the cure period – Pertinently, the clause uses two separate
phrases, “cure” and “effective steps to cure” – The Tribunal found
that since certain defects remained after the cure period, this was
indicative of the fact that the defects were not cured and that no
effective steps were taken – The Tribunal fails to explain what
amounts to an ‘effective step’ and how the steps taken by DMRC
were not effective, within the meaning of the phrase – Parties
clearly intended that once a cure notice was served on a party, it
would be open to them to either cure defects or to initiate effective
steps, even if they could not culminate into the complete curing of
defects within the cure period – Incremental progress, even if it
does not lead to complete cure, is an acceptable course of action
to prevent termination according to the 2008 Agreement – The
decisions of the Single Judge of the High Court and this Court
(two-judge bench) are similarly silent on the aspect of “effective
steps” – The judgment of this Court also never tested the relevance
476 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of the CMRS certificate vis-à-vis “effective steps” – Admittedly,
some of the defects were cured in their entirety and steps were
taken by DMRC to cure the remainders – DMRC did take certain
steps to alleviate DAMEPL’s concerns so as to warrant this change
of position – There is no explanation forthcoming in the award
about why none of these steps initiated during the cure period
were ‘effective steps’ – This gap in reasoning stems from the
arbitral tribunal wrongly separating the issue of termination and
the CMRS certificate – The structure and safety of the project,
as certified by the CMRS, were thus relevant before the Tribunal,
making the CMRS certificate a vital piece of evidence in deciding
the issue – The CMRS certificate was relevant evidence about
the safety of the structure – The arbitral tribunal erroneously
rejected the CMRS sanction as irrelevant – The Division Bench
correctly held that the arbitral tribunal ignored vital evidence on
the record, resulting in perversity and patent illegality, warranting
interference – The conclusions of the Division Bench are, thus, in
line with the settled precedent including the decisions in Associate
Builders and Ssangyong – The judgment of the two-judge Bench
of this Court, which interfered with the judgment of the Division
Bench of the High Court, has resulted in a miscarriage of justice
– Thus, Curative Petitions allowed. [Paras 44, 48, 49, 50, 53,

1. The curative jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the
Constitution has been invoked in regard to its decision in Delhi Airport
Metro Express Private Limited vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
Ltd.1. The judgment remained undisturbed in the exercise of the
review jurisdiction of this Court.2
A. Factual Background
2. The petitioner, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation3 is a state-owned
company wholly owned by the Government of India and the National
Capital Territory of Delhi. The respondent, Delhi Airport Metro
Express Private Limited4 is a special-purpose vehicle incorporated
by a consortium comprising of Reliance Infrastructure Limited
and Construcciones Y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA, Spain. The
consortium bagged the contract for the construction, operation and
maintenance of the Delhi Airport Metro Express Ltd5 in 2008. The
Concession Agreement6 envisaged a public-private partnership

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
for providing metro rail connectivity between New Delhi Railway
Station and the Indira Gandhi International Airport and other points
within Delhi.
3. Under the 2008 Agreement, DAMEPL was granted exclusive rights,
license and authority to implement the project and concession in
respect of AMEL. This included the right to manage and operate
the Project as a commercial enterprise. DMRC was to undertake
clearances and bear costs relating to land acquisition, and civil
structures, while DAMEPL was to undertake among other things,
the design, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of railway
systems. DAMEPL was to complete the work in two years, and
thereafter, to maintain AMEL until August 2038.
4. In April 2012, DAMEPL sought a deferment of the concession fee,
citing delays in providing access to the stations by DMRC. DAMEPL
stated that while AMEL had been running without a glitch since 23
February 2011, the retail activity had not picked pace. DAMEPL
urged DMRC to extend their support, to this first-of-its-kind public-
private partnership by deferring the concession fee payable by
DAMEPL.
5. There was an exchange of correspondence between the parties
which ultimately led the Ministry of Urban Development to convene
a meeting of stakeholders in July 2012. A Joint Inspection Committee
was set up to inspect the defects alleged by DAMEPL.
6. Meanwhile, DAMEPL expressed its intention to halt operations,
alleging that the line was unsafe to operate. Operations were stopped
on 08 July 2012. On 09 July 2012, DAMEPL issued a notice to DMRC
containing a ‘non-exhaustive’ list of eight defects which according to
them, affected the performance of their obligations under the 2008
Agreement7. The notice stated that the defects were attributable to
faulty construction and deficient designs which affected project safety.
7. DAMEPL stated that the defects caused a “material adverse effect”
on the performance of the obligations by it to operate, manage and
maintain the project. DMRC was therefore requested to cure the
defects within 90 days from the date of this notice, failing which
it stated that it would be considered that a “Material Breach” and
7 “Cure Notice”
480 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
a “DMRC Event of Default” had occasioned, entitling DAMEPL to
terminate the 2008 agreement.
8. On 8 October 2012, DAMPEL issued a notice terminating the 2008
agreement.8 The termination notice stated that as 90 days had
elapsed since the cure notice in spite of which the defects had not
been cured within the ‘cure period’, DAMEPL as Concessionaire
was terminating the agreement in terms of clause 29.5.1 of the
2008 agreement.
9. DMRC initiated conciliation under clause 36.1 of the 2008 Agreement.
Since conciliation did not succeed, DMRC initiated arbitration
proceedings on 23 October 2012 under clause 36.2 of the 2008
agreement.
10. On 30 June 2013, DAMEPL halted operations and handed over the
line to DMRC. Before this, on 19 November 2012, both parties made
a joint application to the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety9
for re-opening of AMEL for public carriage of passengers. Enclosed
with the application, was an administrative note jointly signed by
representatives of both DAMEPL and DMRC, which we shall avert
to in the course of the judgment.
11. Following this application, after inquiry and inspection, the CMRS
issued sanction on 18 January 2013. This sanction was subject to
certain conditions including speed restrictions. Specifically, the metro
was to be run at a speed of 50kmph, and an increase in speed beyond
50kmph up to 80kmph was to be authorized in steps of 10kmph at
a time. For an increase in speed beyond 80kmph, DMRC was to
approach the Commissioner for sanction with a justification as to
the improvements carried out by it.
12. Consequently, on 22 January 2013, AMEL operations were
commenced by DAMEPL. On 30 June 2013, the project assets were
handed over by DAMEPL to DMRC. After that, from 01 July 2013,
DMRC continued AMEL operations.
13. In August 2013, the arbitral tribunal comprising Mr AP Mishra, Mr
SS Khurana and Mr HL Bajaj was constituted.10 On 11 May 2017,

[2024] 4 S.C.R. 481
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
the three-member Tribunal passed a unanimous award in favour of
DAMEPL11.
14. The award held that DAMEPL was entitled first, to the termination
payment of Rs. 2782.33 Crores plus interest in terms of the
concession agreement; second, to expenses incurred in operating
AMEL from 07 January 2013 to 30 June 2013 and debt service made
by DAMEPL during this period, of Rs 147.52 Crores plus interest at
11% per annum from the date of payment of stamp duty; third, to
the refund of the bank guarantee amounting to Rs 62.07 Crores plus
interest at 11% p.a. which had been encashed; fourth, to security
deposits with the service providers, amounting to Rs 56.8 Lakhs
plus interest at 11% p.a.; and that DMRC was entitled to Rs 46.04
Crores as Concession fee for the period from 23 February 2012 to
7 January 2013.
15. Assailing the award, DMRC instituted an application under Section
34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 199612 before the Delhi High
Court. The Single-Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition13.
This gave rise to an appeal under Section 37 before a Division Bench
of the High Court. The appeal was partly allowed.14
16. Against the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court, DAMEPL
moved a Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the Constitution.
A two-judge bench of this Court allowed the appeal, and restored
the award. The review petition assailing this decision was dismissed.
Thus, the curative petition.
B. DMRC’s claim and the Tribunal’s findings
17. Before the Tribunal, DMRC claimed that – (i) it took steps to cure
the defects immediately after it received the cure notice, including
approaching SYSTRA -the original design consultant and convening
meetings with the Ministry of Urban Development and that DAMEPL
actively participated in all of these steps; (ii) that the real reason
for the termination notice was that DAMPL had ceased to find the
project financially viable. DMRC sought, inter alia, quashing of the
11 “Award”
12 “Arbitration Act”.

482 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
termination notice; and a direction to the respondent to resume the
performance of its obligations under the 2008 agreement. DAMEPL,
on the other hand, claimed that there were defects attributable to
DMRC’s faulty design; that these defects were not cured and no
effective steps were taken to cure them within the 90-day cure
period, resulting in material adverse effects to DAMEPL, entitling it
to terminate the concession agreement.
18. The Tribunal was required to adjudicate on the validity of the
termination notice. It framed the following issues:
“Were there any defects in the civil structure of the airport
metro line?
If there were defects, did such defects have a material
adverse effect on the performance of the obligation of
DAMEPL under CA?
If there were defects in the civil structure, which had
a material adverse effect on the performance of the
obligations under the CA by DAMEPL, have such defects
been cured by DMRC and/or have any effective steps been
taken within a period of 90 days from the date of notice
by DAMEPL to cure the defects by DMRC and thus, were
DMRC in breach of the CA as per 29.5.1 (i)?”
19. The Tribunal undertook an analysis of the defects in the structure
and whether they had been cured or effective steps taken during
the cure period. It noted that 72% of the girders were affected by
cracks; the cause of the cracks was uncertain; the depth of the
cracks was not reliably determined; and that the inspection for
repairs carried out at the instance of DMRC was ‘non-serious’.
Further, it noted that there were twists in about 80 girders and
gaps between the shear key and the girders which were not cured
by DMRC in the cure period. Taken together, these defects were
considered to have compromised the integrity of the structure. This,
the Tribunal held, amounted to a breach of DMRC’s obligations
under the 2008 agreement resulting in a material adverse effect
on the concessionaire.
20. The Tribunal framed the legal issues that arose for its consideration.
The issue about the validity of the termination agreement was framed
in the following terms:
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 483
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
“D. Was DAMEPL entitled to or justified in termination of
the CA, since the cost of repairs of the alleged defects was
only approximately Rs.14 crores as compared to the total
costs of the project of approximately Rs. 5700 crores?”
21. The issue pertaining to the CMRS certificate was framed as follows:
“H. Did the issuance of certificate by CMRS show that the
defects were duly cured?”
22. Both these issues were answered in the negative by the Tribunal. On
Issue ‘D’ about the validity of the termination, it was held that since
the Tribunal had found that there were defects in the civil structure,
which remained uncured during the cure period, the amount incurred
by DMRC in repairs compared to the overall cost of the project was
irrelevant.15 On issue ‘H’, about the CMRS certificate, the tribunal
found that the CMRS sanction mandated rigorous monitoring of
operations of the line and imposed a speed restriction. Since the
purpose of the line was to serve as a high-speed line, the tribunal found
that the speed restrictions meant that this purpose was not served
and therefore, the CMRS certificate or the subsequent operation of
the line were not relevant in deciding the issues before it.16
C. Decisions of the High Court
23. The Single Judge of the High Court17, deciding the Section 34
application, upheld the award, observing that so long as the award
was reasonable and plausible, considering the material before the
Tribunal no interference was warranted, even if an alternate view
was possible. It was held that the Tribunal, in this case, had analysed
material and evidence in great detail, and arrived at a plausible
conclusion.
24. The Division Bench of the High Court18 partly set aside the award
as perverse and patently illegal, for the following reasons:
24.1. On the validity of the termination, ex-facie, the termination
which was effective immediately from the date of termination
15 The Award, para 93.
16 ibid, paras 105-108.
17 “Single Judge”.
18 “Division Bench”.
484 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
was invalid. There was some ambiguity on the relevant date
of termination. The award did not interpret clause 29.5.1(i)
of the concession agreement regarding the duration of the
cure period;
24.2. The speed restrictions were not stated as the reason for
termination in the cure or termination notices and there was no
deliberation on this being a justification for termination before
the Tribunal. Thus, the award was silent and unreasoned on
this issue; and
24.3. Underlining the significance of the CMRS sanction under the
Act of 2002, the findings of the tribunal on this issue were
incorrect because (i) the award overlooked the legal effect
of the CMRS certificate which was binding on the tribunal;
and (ii) the award erroneously treated the CMRS certificate
as irrelevant to the issue of the validity of the termination by
wrongly separating the issue of defects and material adverse
effects from the issue of the certificate.
D. Judgment of this Court in appeal
25. This Court set aside the decision of the Division Bench and restored
the arbitral award on the following grounds:
25.1. There was no ambiguity in the date of termination and even
if a different view from that of the tribunal were possible,
construction of the provisions of the contract was within the
exclusive domain of the tribunal;
25.2. The award was not perverse. The finding of the tribunal that
the defects were not cured was a finding of fact, not warranting
interference;
25.3. DMRC had not contended before the Tribunal that the
certificate was binding and conclusive of the fact that the
defects were cured or that effective steps had been taken; and
25.4. The Division Bench of the High Court was in error in
holding that the issue of the CMRS certificate was wrongly
separated from the issue of defects. It held that dealing with
the certificate separately from the validity of termination did
not render the tribunal’s findings on the latter erroneous. The
Tribunal comprised of engineers and the award could not
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 485
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
be scrutinised in the same manner as an award drawn by a
legally trained mind.
26. The review petition against the above judgment of this Court was
dismissed on 23 November 2021.
E. Issues in the Curative Petition
27. The issues that arise for our consideration are (i) whether the
curative petition is maintainable; and (ii) whether this Court was
justified in restoring the arbitral award which had been set aside by
the Division Bench of the High court on the ground that it suffered
from patently illegality.
F. Submissions
28. We have heard Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney General for India
and Mr K K Venugopal, Mr Parag Tripathi, and Mr Maninder Singh
senior counsel on behalf of the petitioners. They made the following
submissions:
28.1. Considering the definition of ‘material adverse effect’ under the
concession agreement, the defects had no material adverse
effect on DAMEPL’s performance of obligations under the
agreement, as is apparent from the running of the metro
line. The purpose of the agreement was fully subserved, as
evinced by the continuous running of the line;
28.2. The purpose of the cure notice was to demand cure
compliance from DMRC. As long as ‘effective steps’ were
taken by DMRC, culminating in cure compliance under the
statutory process under the Metro Railways (Operation
and Maintenance) Act, 200219, the termination notice was
invalid;
28.3. Clause 29.5.1 of the agreement shows that the termination
ought to have been effected after 90 days from the cure notice
plus 90 days in addition. Termination was thus effective only
on 07 January 2013 and on this date, none of the defects
were pending to be rectified by DMRC;
19 The 2002 Act
486 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
28.4. The sanction/certificate granted by CMRS was issued on a
joint application by both the parties after thorough inspection
of the operations. The terms of the agreement and the
provisions relating to the CMRS process under the 2002 Act
are intrinsically connected;
28.5. The Tribunal should have considered the binding effect of the
CMRS sanction as the issue of speed was neither raised, nor
deliberated before it and was irrelevant to the termination;
28.6. The line has been running since 1 July 2013. The speed
of operations was sanctioned at 50kmph, and has been
progressively increased to 60 kmph in January 2013, 80 kmph
in August 2013, 90 kmph in July 2019, and ultimately 100
kmph and then 110 kmph in 2023. The metro was running
at 80 kmph prior to the termination of the agreement. It is
currently running at 120kmph for which a fresh sanction was
obtained from the CMRS. The smooth operation of the metro
line for five and a half years, until the date of the award was
entirely ignored by the Tribunal, making the award perverse;
28.7. The running of the metro line shows that even if there were
defects, they did not render the metro unviable nor did they
interfere with DAMEPL’s obligations under the agreement.
Thus, the award is perverse and patently illegal;
28.8. The tribunal ignored vital evidence, warranting the High
Court’s interference under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
The miscarriage of justice principle is informed by the scheme
of the Arbitration Act;
28.9. The High Court’s interference with the patent illegality was
justified and this Court under Article 136 ought to have been slow
to interfere with the decision of the Division Bench of the high
Court. Miscarriage of justice in terms of the decision in Rupa
Hurra vs. Ashok Hurra20 is linked with patent illegality. The High
Court’s interference under Section 37 was justified because the
exercise of jurisdiction under Section 34 was erroneous; and
28.10. The issue of the fitness of the line was a matter falling under
the 2002 Act under which the Commissioner was the final
20 [2002] 2 SCR 1006 : 2002 4 SCC 388
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 487
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
authority to decide on the safety of the metro. The certificate
could not have been substituted by the Tribunal’s finding on
safety of the line.
29. We have heard Mr Harish Salve, Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr JJ Bhatt and Mr
Prateek Seksaria, learned senior counsel for the respondent. They
have made the following submissions:
29.1. The curative petition is not maintainable as this Court cannot
revisit the conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal;
29.2. DMRC has taken over the project and has been operating
it since 01 July 2012 without having paid for its operation
between 01 January 2013 till 30 June 2013, except for a
small fraction of the total awarded amount;
29.3. Till early March 2023, the trains were running at 90kmph,
as opposed to the speed of 120kmph at which they ought to
have been running;
29.4. The issue about the relevance of the CMRS certificate has
been squarely addressed by the Single Judge and this Court.
The arbitrator is the sole judge of the quality and the quantity
of evidence;
29.5. The award was made after 68 hearings and after consideration
of 35,000 pages of documents and oral evidence. It has been
two and a half years since this Court restored the award on
09 September 2021 and the review against this decision was
dismissed on 23 November 2021;
29.6. According to the decision in Rupa Hurra (supra), the court is
not supposed to sit over a judgment like a court of appeal. The
scope of the review jurisdiction is narrow in itself and does
not warrant rehearing and correction of a judgment. Curative
proceedings cannot be treated as a second review; and
29.7. DAMEPL is not unjustly enriching itself. DAMEPL completed
the project with an investment of Rs 2802 Crores comprising
of debt and equity contributions and it continued to service
the debt even after handing over the line to DMRC. DMRC on
the other hand, has paid the decretal amount of Rs 2599.18
Crores while Rs 5088 Crores under the decree is outstanding
as on 31 January 2024.

G. Analysis
I. Curative Jurisdiction may be invoked if there is a
miscarriage of justice
30. Senior Counsel for the respondent set forth preliminary objections
challenging the maintainability of the Curative Petition, in view of the
scope of that jurisdiction delineated inter alia in the decision in Rupa
Hurra (supra) We will first lay down the contours of the jurisdiction
of this Court to entertain a curative petition in exercise of its inherent
powers under Article 142.
31. In Rupa Hurra (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court dwelt on
whether any relief is available against a final judgement of this Court
after the dismissal of a petition seeking review of the judgement.
Two opinions were authored. The main judgment was by Justice
Syed Shah Quadri (on behalf of Chief Justice S P Bharucha, Justice
Variava, Justice Shivraj Patil and himself). A concurring opinion was
authored by Justice U C Banerjee.
32. Justice Quadri observed that the concern of the Court for rendering
justice in a cause cannot be considered less important than the
principle of finality. There are certain situations, the opinion observed,
which would require reconsideration of a final judgement even after
the review has been dismissed to set right a miscarriage of justice.
Such circumstances, the court held, are those where declining to
reconsider the judgement would be oppressive to judicial conscience
and cause the perpetuation of irremediable injustice. Justice Quadri
observed:
“42. … the duty to do justice in these rarest of rare cases
shall have to prevail over the policy of certainty of judgment
as though it is essentially in the public interest that a final
judgment of the final court in the country should not be
open to challenge, yet there may be circumstances, as
mentioned above, wherein declining to reconsider the
judgment would be oppressive to judicial conscience
and would cause perpetuation of irremediable
injustice.”
(emphasis supplied)
33. This Court laid down an overarching principle that the Court may
entertain a curative petition to (i) prevent abuse of its process; and
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 489
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
(ii) to cure a gross miscarriage of justice.21 The Court provided
examples of such circumstances, such as a violation of the principles
of natural justice; or a situation where the Judge fails to disclose his
connection with the subject matter or the parties, giving scope for
an apprehension of bias. However, the Court observed that it is not
possible to exhaustively enumerate the grounds on which a curative
petition may be entertained. The Court noted as follows:
“50. The next step is to specify the requirements to entertain
such a curative petition under the inherent power of this
Court so that floodgates are not opened for filing a second
review petition as a matter of course in the guise of a
curative petition under inherent power. It is common ground
that except when very strong reasons exist, the Court
should not entertain an application seeking reconsideration
of an order of this Court which has become final on
dismissal of a review petition. It is neither advisable nor
possible to enumerate all the grounds on which such
a petition may be entertained.
51. Nevertheless, we think that a petitioner is entitled to
relief ex debito justitiae if he establishes (1) violation of the
principles of natural justice in that he was not a party to
the lis but the judgment adversely affected his interests or,
if he was a party to the lis, he was not served with notice
of the proceedings and the matter proceeded as if he had
notice, and (2) where in the proceedings a learned Judge
failed to disclose his connection with the subject-matter or
the parties giving scope for an apprehension of bias and
the judgment adversely affects the petitioner.”
34. The enumeration of the situations in which the curative jurisdiction
can be exercised is thus not intended to be exhaustive. The Court
went on to lay down certain procedural requirements to entertain a
curative petition such as a certificate by a Senior Advocate about
fulfilling of the requirements.
35. In his concurring opinion, Justice Banerjee also laid down a similar
test of ‘manifest injustice’ to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court
21 Rupa Hurra, para 49.
490 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
under Article 142 while entertaining a curative petition. In essence, the
jurisdiction of this Court, while deciding a curative petition, extends
to cases where the Court acts beyond its jurisdiction, resulting in
a grave miscarriage of justice. We now proceed to lay down the
scope of jurisdiction of this Court and the competent courts below
while dealing with cases arising out of an application to set aside
an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
II. Scope of interference of courts with arbitral awards
36. Section 34 of the Arbitration Act delineates the grounds for setting
aside an arbitral award. The provision, as amended by the Arbitration
and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 reads as follows:
“34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.—
…
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if—
…
(b) the Court finds that--
(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of
settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being
in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy
of India.
Explanation 1. --For the avoidance of any doubt, it is
clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy
of India, only if,--
(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by
fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or
section 81; or
(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of
Indian law; or
(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality
or justice.
Explanation 2. --For the avoidance of doubt, the test as
to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 491
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits
of the dispute.
(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other
than international commercial arbitrations, may also
be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the
award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the
face of the award:
Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on
the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by
reappreciation of evidence.”
(emphasis supplied)
37. The contours of the power of the competent court to set aside an
award under Section 34 has been explored in several decisions of
this Court. In addition to the grounds on which an arbitral award
can be assailed laid down in Section 34(2), there is another ground
for challenge against domestic awards, such as the award in the
present case. Under Section 34(2-A) of the Arbitration Act, a domestic
award may be set aside if the Court finds that it is vitiated by ‘patent
illegality’ appearing on the face of the award.
38. In Associate Builders vs. Delhi Development Authority22, a two-
judge Bench of this Court held that although the interpretation of a
contract is exclusively within the domain of the arbitrator, construction
of a contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person
would take, is impermissible. A patent illegality arises where the
arbitrator adopts a view which is not a possible view. A view can be
regarded as not even a possible view where no reasonable body of
persons could possibly have taken it. This Court held with reference
to Sections 28(1)(a) and 28(3), that the arbitrator must take into
account the terms of the contract and the usages of trade applicable
to the transaction. The decision or award should not be perverse
or irrational. An award is rendered perverse or irrational where the
findings are (i) based on no evidence; (ii) based on irrelevant material;
or (iii) ignores vital evidence. Patent illegality may also arise where
the award is in breach of the provisions of the arbitration statute, as
when for instance the award contains no reasons at all, so as to be
22 [2014] 13 SCR 895 : 2015 3 SCC 49.
492 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
described as unreasoned. A fundamental breach of the principles
of natural justice will result in a patent illegality, where for instance
the arbitrator has let in evidence behind the back of a party. In the
above decision, this Court observed:
“31. The third juristic principle is that a decision which is
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would
have arrived at the same is important and requires some
degree of explanation. It is settled law that where:
(i) a finding is based on no evidence, or
(ii) an Arbitral Tribunal takes into account something
irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or
(iii) ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision,
such decision would necessarily be perverse.
…
42.2. (b) A contravention of the Arbitration Act itself
would be regarded as a patent illegality — for example
if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in
contravention of Section 31(3) of the Act, such award
will be liable to be set aside.”
(emphasis supplied)
39. In Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI23,
a two-judge bench of this Court endorsed the position in Associate
Builders (supra), on the scope for interference with domestic awards,
even after the 2015 Amendment:
“40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment
Act really follows what is stated in paras 42.3 to 45 in
Associate Builders, namely, that the construction of the
terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide,
unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner
that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; in
short, that the arbitrator’s view is not even a possible
view to take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the
23 [2019] 7 SCR 522 : 2019 15 SCC 131
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 493
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
contract and deals with matters not allotted to him,
he commits an error of jurisdiction. This ground of
challenge will now fall within the new ground added
under Section 34(2-A).
41. … Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or
an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its
decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside
on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding
based on documents taken behind the back of the parties
by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based
on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based
on evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also
have to be characterised as perverse.”
(emphasis supplied)
40. In essence, the ground of patent illegality is available for setting
aside a domestic award, if the decision of the arbitrator is found to
be perverse, or so irrational that no reasonable person would have
arrived at it; or the construction of the contract is such that no fair
or reasonable person would take; or, that the view of the arbitrator
is not even a possible view.24 A ‘finding’ based on no evidence at all
or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision
would be perverse and liable to be set aside under the head of
‘patent illegality’. An award without reasons would suffer from patent
illegality. The arbitrator commits a patent illegality by deciding a
matter not within his jurisdiction or violating a fundamental principle
of natural justice.
41. A judgment setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award
under Section 34 is appealable in the exercise of the jurisdiction
of the court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. It has been
clarified by this Court, in a line of precedent, that the jurisdiction
under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act is akin to the jurisdiction of
the Court under Section 34 and restricted to the same grounds of
challenge as Section 34.25
24 Patel Engineering Limited vs North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (2020) 7 SCC 176.
25 MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd, (2019) 4 SCC 163, para 14; Konkan Railways v. Chenab Bridge Project
Undertaking, 2023 INSC 742, para 14.
494 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
42. In the statutory scheme of the Arbitration Act, a recourse to Section
37 is the only appellate remedy available against a decision under
Section 34. The Constitution, however, provides the parties with a
remedy under Article 136 against a decision rendered in appeal under
Section 37. This is the discretionary and exceptional jurisdiction of
this Court to grant Special Leave to Appeal. In fact, Section 37(3) of
the Arbitration Act expressly clarifies that no second appeal shall lie
from an order passed under Section 37, but nothing in the section
takes away the constitutional right under Article 136. Therefore, in
a sense, there is a third stage at which this court tests the exercise
of jurisdiction by the courts acting under Section 34 and Section 37
of the Arbitration Act.
43. While adjudicating the merits of a Special Leave Petition and
exercising its power under Article 136, this Court must interfere
sparingly and only when exceptional circumstances exist, justifying
the exercise of this Court’s discretion.26 The Court must apply settled
principles of judicial review such as whether the findings of the High
Court are borne out from the record or are based on a misappreciation
of law and fact. In particular, this Court must be slow in interfering
with a judgement delivered in exercise of powers under Section 37
unless there is an error in exercising of the jurisdiction by the Court
under Section 37 as delineated above. Unlike the exercise of power
under Section 37, which is akin to Section 34, this Court (under
Article 136) must limit itself to testing whether the court acting under
Section 37 exceeded its jurisdiction by failing to apply the correct
tests to assail the award.
III. The award was patently illegal
44. In the case at hand, the Division Bench found the award to
be perverse, irrational and patently illegal since it ignored the
vital evidence of CMRS certification in deciding the validity of
termination. This, the Division Bench held, overlooked the statutory
certification deeming it irrelevant without reasons and thus the
award was patently illegal according to the test in Associate
Builders (supra).27
26 Chandi Prasad Chokhani v. State of Bihar, AIR 1961 SC 1708; Pritam Singh v. State, 1950 SCC 189.
27 Division Bench, paras 98-99.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 495
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
45. This Court in appeal against the judgment of the Division Bench
of the High Court held that the award was not perverse. Factual
findings such as the finding that the cure period was 90 days and
that DAMEPL was entitled to terminate the contract, could not, it was
held, be interfered with.28 On the CMRS Certificate, this Court held
that the arbitral tribunal was deciding whether there was a breach
of the agreement and whether the defects were cured within the
cure period; hence the safety of the line was not an issue before
the tribunal. This Court held that the Commissioner may be the
competent authority to determine the safety of the project but the
certificate itself did not show that the defects were cured within 90
days. This Court disagreed with the Division Bench and held that the
CMRS certificate had no bearing on the validity of the termination.
46. There is a fundamental error in the manner in which this Court dealt
with the challenge to the decision of the High Court. This jurisdiction
of this Court was invoked under Article 136 of the Constitution. The
Court was exercising its jurisdiction over a decision rendered by the
Division Bench of the High Court in appeal under Section 37. The
Division Bench had held that the award overlooked crucial facts and
evidence on record that were crucial to the determination of the issues
before the arbitral tribunal. This led to the award being perverse and
patently illegal within the parameters of Section 34 as explained
in the judgments of this Court in Associate Builders (supra) and
Ssangyong (supra). The award overlooked the express terms of
clause 29.5.1(i) which stipulated that if “effective steps” were taken
during the cure period by DMRC, the contractual power to terminate
could not be exercised. This Court incorrectly considered the CMRS
certificate to be irrelevant to the validity of the termination.
i. Interpretation of the termination clause by the Tribunal was
unreasonable
47. Interference with an arbitral award cannot frustrate the ‘commercial
wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution’, merely because
an alternate view exists.29 However, the interpretation of a contract
cannot be unreasonable, such that no person of ordinary prudence
would take it. The contract, which is a culmination of the parties’
28 Civil Appeal, para 31.
29 Dyna Technologies Private Limited v. Crompton Greaves Limited, (2019) 20 SCC 1, paras 24, 25.
496 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
agency, should be given full effect. If the interpretation of the terms
of the contract as adopted by the tribunal was not even a possible
view, the award is perverse.30
48. Clause 29.5.1(i) entitles the concessionaire to terminate the
agreement if DMRC “failed to cure such breach or take effective
steps for curing such breach” within the cure period. Pertinently,
the clause uses two separate phrases, “cure” and “effective steps
to cure”. The clause reads as follows:
“29.5.1 The Concessionaire may after giving 90 (ninety)
days’ notice in writing to DMRC terminate this Agreement
upon the occurrence and continuation of any of the following
events (each a “DMRC Event of Default”), unless any
such DMRC Event of Default has occurred as a result
of Concessionaire Event of Default or due to a Force
Majeure Event.
(i) DMRC is in breach of this Agreement and such breach
has a Material Adverse Effect on the Concessionaire and
DMRC has failed to cure such breach or take effective
steps for curing such breach within 90 (ninety) days of
receipt of notice in this behalf from the Concessionaire;”
(emphasis supplied)
49. The Tribunal found that since certain defects remained after the
cure period, this was indicative of the fact that the defects were not
cured and that no effective steps were taken. However, logically,
the fact that defects existed at the end of the cure period relates
to one aspect of the termination clause – that the defects were not
completely cured. It does not explain whether effective steps were
taken within the cure period. Effectively, the Tribunal considered that
in-progress steps that had not yet culminated into completely cured
defects were not “effective steps” to offset termination. This places
the two components i.e. ‘curing of defects’ and ‘taking effective steps
to cure defects’ at par, to mean that only the completed curing of
defects is relevant. The Tribunal fails to explain what amounts to an
‘effective step’ and how the steps taken by DMRC were not effective,
within the meaning of the phrase.
30 Konkan Railway Corporation Limited v. Chenab Bridge Project Undertaking, 2023 9 SCC 85.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 497
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
50. Evidently, this could not have been the intention of the parties,
because they have clearly agreed to include the phrase “effective
steps”. They clearly intended that once a cure notice was served
on a party, it would be open to them to either cure defects or to
initiate effective steps, even if they could not culminate into the
complete curing of defects within the cure period. Incremental
progress, even if it does not lead to complete cure, is an acceptable
course of action to prevent termination according to the 2008
Agreement.
51. The Tribunal did not appreciate the individual import of the two
phrases separately from each other. This was not a matter of mere
“alternate interpretation” of the clause, but an unreasonable and
uncalled for interpretation of the clause, which frustrated the very
provision, and which no reasonable person would have accepted
considering the terms of the clause. We must clarify that Tribunal
could have still arrived at the conclusion that the steps taken during
the cure period were not effective within the meaning of the clause
for certain reasons. However, such discussion and reasoning is
conspicuously absent.
52. Issue H framed by the Tribunal- “Did the issuance of certificate by
CMRS show that the defects were duly cured” similarly glosses
over the effective steps aspect of the clause. Given this framing,
the issue was bound to be answered in the negative since
the CMRS certificate does not conclude that the defects were
completely cured.
53. The decisions of the Single Judge and this Court are similarly silent
on the aspect of “effective steps”. In paragraphs 31 to 34 of its
judgment, this Court noted that since the defects were not cured in
90 days, the termination was valid. Impliedly, this Court found that
the defects ought to have been fully cured within the cure period
in order to avoid termination.
54. The judgment of this Court also never tested the relevance of the
CMRS certificate vis-à-vis “effective steps”. This Court accepted a
reading of the termination clause by the Arbitral tribunal and the
Single Judge that was not even a possible view and could not
have been arrived at on any objective assessment. This Court not
only overlooked the plain words of the clause but also rendered the
phrase “effective steps” otiose.
498 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
ii. The award overlooked vital evidence and matters on the record
55. The erroneous and misleading framing of the issue as noted above led
to the ignoring of vital evidence relevant to the issue of termination.
The arbitral tribunal held that since the Commissioner imposed
conditions of inspection and speed restrictions, this meant that the
defects were not fully cured.
56. Certainly, the imposition of conditions shows that the defects were
not cured completely, to warrant an unconditional sanction for full
speed operations. However, as the Division Bench of the High Court
correctly observed, the separation of the validity of termination and
relevance of the CMRS certificate was the reason for this erroneous
finding. Since the ‘effective steps’ aspect was overlooked, the CMRS
certificate was erroneously deemed to be irrelevant.
57. On 19 November 2012, a joint application was made by the parties
to the Commissioner under the 2002 Act. Significantly, the annexure
to the application which was jointly signed by the parties states as
set out below:
“f) The repairs have been Inspected by an Independent
Engineer M/s TUV, engaged by
DMRC to conduct the technical check on the quality
of work and to ensure that the repairs are carried out
as per the approved repair methodology. The copies
of the certificates obtained from TUV are enclosed as
Annexures xvii.
g) Cracks in soffit of some ‘U’ girders were also observed
and, therefore, inspection of all the girders have been
done and mapping of the cracks have been undertaken
accordingly (Annexure-xviii). Cracks have beery noticed
in 367 girders. These cracks were analysed by M/s
SYSTRA and their report is, enclosed as Annexure xix.
They have concluded that there is no effect on the
integrity of the girders and that there is no reason
to-be further worried. M/s SYSTRA have also given
the repair methodology for these cracks from the point of
view of durability and to avoid permeation of water during
the service life of girders, (Included in Annexure-xvi).
Accordingly, the cracks wider than 0.2 mm have been
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 499
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
Injected with epoxy resin and cracks less than 0.2 mm
have been sealed with epoxy sealant.
h) Train trials after repairs by DMRC have been
completed successfully and all systems have been
checked for correct functioning at various speeds
Including at speed of 120 kmph. Track recording was
done with OMS-2000 during these trials and no peak of
value ≥ 0.15g was recorded upto 120 Kmph (results of
OMS 2000 are enclosed in Annexure XIV)”
(emphasis supplied)
58. Admittedly, some of the defects were cured in their entirety and
steps were taken by DMRC to cure the remainders, based on which
the parties had jointly sought permission under the 2002 Act. The
parties stated that the repairs had been inspected by an independent
engineer; an analysis of the cracks revealed that the integrity of the
girders was intact and there was no cause of concern. Further, the
parties stated that the train trials “after repairs by DMRC have been
completed successfully and all systems have been checked for correct
functioning at various speeds including the speed of 120kmph”. It is
apparent on the face of the record that certain repairs were completed
by DMRC and the trials had been completed at full speed as on the
date of application, 19 November 2012.
59. On 9 July 2012, about four months before the date of the joint
application, DAMEPL had averred in the cure notice that the project
was not ‘safe for operations’ and that it posed a threat to life and
property. The arbitral tribunal was correct in concluding that the joint
application does not constitute a waiver of the termination, but this
evidence was vital considering the change in DAMEPL’s position
on the safety of the line from the date of the cure notice to the date
of the joint application. DMRC did take certain steps to alleviate
DAMEPL’s concerns so as to warrant this change of position. There
is no explanation forthcoming in the award about why none of these
steps initiated during the cure period were ‘effective steps’. This gap
in reasoning stems from the arbitral tribunal wrongly separating the
issue of termination and the CMRS certificate.
60. Besides the effective steps aspect, there is another reason why the
CMRS certificate ought to have been treated as relevant. The Tribunal
treats the cure notice as a crucial document. At paragraph 26 of the
500 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
award, it noted that “since the cure notice dated 9th July 2012 is a
crucial document in this case, it is useful to quote certain paragraphs
of the said letter”. The cure notice, in turn, was heavily premised on
the safety of operations.31 Interestingly, at paragraph 27 of the cure
notice, DAMEPL avers that the trains can only be operated once
the defects are cured to the satisfaction of the stakeholders about
the safety of operations.
61. Reference may be made to the 2002 Act under which the CMRS is
the relevant statutory stakeholder whose satisfaction about the safety
of operations is necessary for running of the metro. The relevant
provisions of the Act may be adverted to here:
“14. Sanction of Central Government to the opening
of metro railway.—The metro railway in the the National
Capital Region, metropolitan city and metropolitan area shall
not be opened for the public carriage of passengers except
with the previous sanction of the Central Government.
15. Formalities to be complied with before giving
sanction to the opening of metro railway.—(1) The
Central Government shall, before giving its sanction to the
opening of the metro railway under Section 14, obtain a
report from the Commissioner that—
(a) he has made a careful inspection of the metro railway
and the rolling stock that may be used thereon;
(b) the moving and fixed dimensions as laid down by
the Central Government have not been infringed;
(c) the track structure, strength of bridges, standards of
signalling system, traction system, general structural
character of civil works and the size of, and maximum
gross load upon, the axles of any rolling stock, comply
with the requirements laid down by the Central
Government; and
(d) in his opinion, metro railway can be opened for the
public carriage of passengers without any danger to
the public using it.
31 Cure Notice paras 18,21,26, and 27.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 501
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
(2) If the Commissioner is of the opinion that the metro
railway cannot be opened without any danger to the
public using it, he shall, in his report, state the grounds
therefor, as also the requirements which, in his opinion,
are to be complied with before sanction is given by the
Central Government.
(3) The Central Government, after considering the report
of the Commissioner, may sanction the opening of the
metro railway under Section 14 as such or subject to such
conditions as may be considered necessary by it for the
safety of the public.
18. Power to close metro railway opened for public
carriage of passengers.—Where, after the inspection
of the metro railway opened and used for the public
carriage of passengers or any rolling stock used thereon,
the Commissioner is of the opinion that the use of the
metro railway or of any rolling stock will be attended with
danger to the public using it, the Commissioner shall send
a report to the Central Government who may thereupon
direct that—
(i) the metro railway be closed for the public carriage
of passengers; or
(ii) the use of the rolling stock be discontinued; or
(iii) the metro railway or the rolling stock may be used
for the public carriage of passengers subject to such
conditions as it may consider necessary for the safety
of the public.
21. Delegation of powers.—The Central Government
may, by notification, direct that any of its powers or
functions under this chapter, except power to make rule
under Section 22, shall, in relation to such matters and
subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified in
the notification, be exercised or discharged also by the
Commissioner.”
62. In essence, the scheme of the 2002 Act, provides that no metro
line will operate except with the previous sanction of the Central
502 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Government.32 Before granting the sanction, the Central Government
has to obtain a report from the Commissioner that (inter alia) the
latter has carefully inspected the metro railway, the general structure
of civil works and that in their opinion, the metro railway can be
opened for passengers without any danger to the public.33 The
Central Government may sanction the opening of the line as such or
subject to conditions it considers necessary for public safety.34 If the
Commissioner is of the opinion that the use of the metro will “attend
danger to the public using it”, they may send a report to the Central
Government, which may in turn direct that the metro be closed or
may be open for public carriage only subject to certain conditions.35
The powers of the Central Government may be delegated to the
Commissioner.36
63. The structure and safety of the project, as certified by the CMRS,
were thus relevant before the Tribunal, making the CMRS certificate
a vital piece of evidence in deciding the issue. The CMRS certificate
was relevant evidence about the safety of the structure. Considering
the statutory scheme of the 2002 Act, especially Section 15, the
Tribunal erred in deeming the sanction irrelevant to its central issue
– which was the validity of the termination, which, according to the
cure notice, was premised on safety.
64. Overall, the cure notice places great emphasis on the safety of the
passengers, which, they claimed stood compromised by defects,
justifying discontinuation of operations. This issue falls directly within
the domain of the Commissioner under the scheme of the 2002 Act.
65. Rather than considering the vital evidence of the CMRS certificate
towards safety and effective steps, the arbitral tribunal focussed on
the conditions imposed by the Commissioner on speed and regarding
inspections. While the Division Bench correctly noted that the
certificate was relevant for the issue of the validity of termination, this
Court held that safety was not in issue, even though DAMEPL insisted
on discontinuing operations citing safety concerns. We respectfully
32 Section 14, Metro Railways (Operations and Maintenance) Act 2002.
33 Section 15, ibid.
34 Section 15(3), ibid.
35 Section 18, ibid.
36 Section 21, ibid.
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 503
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
disagree with this Court’s re-assessment of the Division Bench’s
interpretation. The cure notice was relevant for the reasons stated
above. Moreover, the fact that DAMEPL premised it on safety could
not have been overlooked by the Tribunal. In doing so, it overlooked
vital evidence pertaining to an issue that goes to the root of the
matter. The cure notice was obviously on the record and merited
consideration for its contents bearing on vital elements of safety.
66. The cure notice, which contains statements bearing on the safety
of the line and other material indicating that the line was running
uninterrupted are matters of record. While the cure notice contains
allegations about the line not being operational, there is evidence
on the record indicating that the line was in fact running. Even if we
were to accept that the finding of the arbitral tribunal that the defects
were not completely cured during the cure period is a factual finding
incapable of interference, it is clear from the record that DMRC took
steps towards curing defects which led to the eventual resumption
of operations. The award contains no explanation as to why the
steps which were taken by DMRC were not ‘effective steps’ within
the meaning of the termination clause.
67. In essence, therefore the award is unreasoned on the above important
aspects. It overlooks vital evidence in the form of the joint application
of the contesting parties to CMRS and the CMRS certificate. The
arbitral tribunal ignored the specific terms of the termination clause. It
reached a conclusion which is not possible for any reasonable body
of persons to arrive at. The arbitral tribunal erroneously rejected the
CMRS sanction as irrelevant. The award bypassed the material on
record and failed to reconcile inconsistencies between the factual
averments made in the cure notice, which formed the basis of
termination on the one hand and the evidence of the successful
running of the line on the other. The Division Bench correctly held
that the arbitral tribunal ignored vital evidence on the record, resulting
in perversity and patent illegality, warranting interference. The
conclusions of the Division Bench are, thus, in line with the settled
precedent including the decisions in Associate Builders (supra)
and Ssangyong (supra).
H. Conclusion
68. The judgment of the two-judge Bench of this Court, which interfered
with the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court, has resulted
504 [2024] 4 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in a miscarriage of justice. The Division Bench applied the correct test
in holding that the arbitral award suffered from the vice of perversity
and patent illegality. The findings of the Division Bench were borne
out from the record and were not based on a misappreciation of law
or fact. This Court failed, while entertaining the Special Leave Petition
under Article 136, to justify its interference with the well-considered
decision of the Division Bench of the High Court. The decision of
this Court fails to adduce any justification bearing on any flaws in
the manner of exercise of jurisdiction by the Division Bench under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. By setting aside the judgement of
the Division Bench, this Court restored a patently illegal award which
saddled a public utility with an exorbitant liability. This has caused
a grave miscarriage of justice, which warrants the exercise of the
power under Article 142 in a Curative petition, in terms of Rupa
Hurra (supra).
69. The Curative petitions must be and are accordingly allowed. The
parties are restored to the position in which they were on the
pronouncement of the judgement of the Division Bench. The execution
proceedings before the High Court for enforcing the arbitral award
must be discontinued and the amounts deposited by the petitioner
pursuant to the judgment of this Court shall be refunded. The part
of the awarded amount, if any, paid by the petitioner as a result of
coercive action is liable to be restored in favour of the petitioner.
The orders passed by the High Court in the course of the execution
proceedings for enforcing the arbitral award are set aside.
70. Before concluding, we clarify that the exercise of the curative
jurisdiction of this Court should not be adopted as a matter of ordinary
course. The curative jurisdiction should not be used to open the
floodgates and create a fourth or fifth stage of court intervention in
an arbitral award, under this Court’s review jurisdiction or curative
jurisdiction, respectively.
71. In the specific facts and circumstances of this case to which we
have adverted in the course of the discussion, we have come to the
conclusion that this Court erred in interfering with the decision of the
Division Bench of the High Court. The judgment of the Division Bench
in the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
1996 was based on a correct application of the test under Section 34
of the Act. The judgment of the Division Bench provided more than
[2024] 4 S.C.R. 505
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. v.
Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.
adequate reasons to come to the conclusion that the arbitral award
suffered from perversity and patent illegality. There was no valid
basis for this Court to interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution.
The interference by this Court has resulted in restoring a patently
illegal award. This has caused a grave miscarriage of justice. We
have applied the standard of a ‘grave miscarriage of justice’ in
the exceptional circumstances of this case where the process of
arbitration has been perverted by the arbitral tribunal to provide an
undeserved windfall to DAMEPL.
72. The curative petitions are allowed in the above terms.
73. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.

[Abhay S. Oka* and Ujjal Bhuyan, JJ.]","The appellant was ordered to be enlarged on bail subject to various
terms and conditions incorporated in the said order. The petitioner
is aggrieved by the two conditions imposed while granting bail.
The two conditions are as follows: (i) A certificate of assurance
from the High Commission of Nigeria is to be placed on record
that the applicants/accused shall not leave the country and shall
appear before the Special Judge as and when required; (ii) Accuse
shall drop a PIN on the google map to ensure that their location
is available to the Investigation Officer of the case.
","Constitution of India – Art. 21 – Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 –
Terms and conditions in a bail – A condition of dropping pin
on Google Map:
Held: In an affidavit, Google LLC stated that the user has full control
over sharing PINs with other users – It does not impinge on the
user’s privacy, as the user retains full control – Most importantly,
it is stated that the PIN location does not enable real-time tracking
of the user or the user’s device – Therefore, the condition of the
accused dropping a pin on Google Maps, as it stands, is completely
redundant as the same does not help the first respondent-Narcotics
Control Bureau (NCB) – Imposing any bail condition which enables
the Police/Investigation Agency to track every movement of the
accused released on bail by using any technology or otherwise
would undoubtedly violate the right to privacy guaranteed under
Article 21 – In the instant case, the condition of dropping a PIN on
Google Maps has been incorporated without even considering the
technical effect of dropping a PIN and the relevance of the said
condition as a condition of bail – This cannot be a condition of

10.1, 10.2]
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 –
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Terms and conditions in
a bail – A condition of furnishing certificate of the Embassy:
Held: It is not necessary that in every case where bail is granted
to an accused in an NDPS case who is a foreign national on the
ground of long incarceration of more than 50% of the minimum
sentence, the condition of obtaining a ‘certificate of assurance’
from the Embassy/High Commission should be incorporated – It
will depend on the facts of each case – Even if such a condition
is incorporated, on an application made by the accused, the
concerned Embassy/High Commission declines or fails to issue
the certificate within a reasonable time, say within a period of
seven days, the Court always has the power to dispense with
the said condition – Grant of such a certificate by the Embassy/
High Commission is beyond the control of the accused to whom
bail is granted – Therefore, when the Embassy/High Commission
does not grant such a certificate within a reasonable time, as
explained above, the accused, who is otherwise held entitled to
bail, cannot be denied bail on the ground that such a condition,
which is impossible for the accused to comply with, has not been
complied with – Hence, the Court will have to delete the condition –
Instead of the condition of obtaining such a certificate, the condition
of surrendering the passport and regularly reporting to the local
police station/Trial Court can always be imposed, depending upon
the facts of each case – Accordingly, in the instant case, the said
condition of furnishing certificate of the Embassy is ordered to be
deleted. [Paras 11.1, 12]

Held: Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the Court’s power to
grant bail is constrained by Sub-section 1(b)(ii) – However, once
a case is made out for a grant of bail in accordance with Section
37, the conditions of bail will have to be in terms of Section 437(3)
of the CrPC – The reason is that because of Section 52 of the
NDPS Act, the provisions of the CrPC apply to the arrests made
under the NDPS Act insofar as they are not inconsistent with the
NDPS Act. [Para 4.1]

words “interest of justice”:
Held: A broader meaning cannot be assigned to the words “interest
of justice” in Section 437(3) of CrPC – By borrowing the language
used by the Supreme Court in its earlier decisions, it is clear that
the bail conditions cannot be fanciful, arbitrary or freakish – The
object of imposing conditions of bail is to ensure that the accused
does not interfere or obstruct the investigation in any manner,
remains available for the investigation, does not tamper with or
destroy evidence, does not commit any offence, remains regularly
present before the Trial Court, and does not create obstacles in the
expeditious conclusion of the trial – The conditions incorporated in
the order granting bail must be within the four corners of Section
437(3) – The bail conditions must be consistent with the object
of imposing conditions – While imposing bail conditions, the
Constitutional rights of an accused, who is ordered to be released
on bail, can be curtailed only to the minimum extent required –
Even an accused convicted by a competent Court and undergoing
a sentence in prison is not deprived of all his rights guaranteed
by Article 21 of the Constitution. [Para 7]

FACTUAL ASPECTS
2. The appellant is being prosecuted for the offences punishable under
Sections 8, 22, 23, and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 (short ‘NDPS Act’). The appellant was arrested
on 21st May 2014. By the first impugned order dated 31st May 2022,
the appellant was ordered to be enlarged on bail subject to various
terms and conditions incorporated in the said order. The terms and
conditions incorporated were in terms of the directions issued by
this Court in paragraph no.15 of its decision in the case of Supreme
Court Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners v.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 101
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
Union of India & Ors.1. The appellant was ordered to be enlarged
on bail on his furnishing a bail bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with
two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Special Judge under the NDPS.
3. The grievances in this appeal have been summed up in the order
dated 21st July 2023 passed by this Court, which reads thus:
“The petitioner is aggrieved by the following condition
imposed while granting bail:
“.. the learned Special Judge, NDPS seized of the
trial in SC No.27/14 shall ensure that the certificate
of assurance from the High Commission of Nigeria
is placed on record that the applicants/accused shall
not leave the country and shall appear before the
learned Special Judge as and when required, in as
much as, the complaint filed by the Narcotics Control
Bureau under Sections 8/22/23/29 of the NDPS Act,
1985 indicates that the appellants are residents of
Nigeria..”
In the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee
vs. vs Union Of India [ (1994) 6 SCC 731] Clause (iv)
reads as under:
“(iv)in the case of undertrial accused who are
foreigners, the Special Judge shall, besides
impounding their passports, insist on a certificate of
assurance from the Embassy/High Commission of
the country to which the foreigner-accused belongs,
that the said accused shall not leave the country and
shall appear before the Special Court as and when
required;”
Prima facie, we are of the view that none of the Embassies/
High Commissions may be able to give assurances as
mentioned in Clause (iv). The question is whether we need
to refer this case to a larger Bench for re-consideration
of Clause (iv).

Digital Supreme Court Reports
Another condition imposed by the High Court reads thus:
“… they shall drop a PIN on the google map to ensure
that their location is available to the Investigation
Officer of the case;...”
The question is whether this condition will offend rights of
the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
We request Mr. Vinay Navare, learned Senior Advocate
to assist us as amicus curiae on both the issues. Registry
to provide a complete set of paper book to the learned
Senior Counsel as well as a copy of this order.

3.1 We have heard Shri Vinay Navare, the learned senior counsel
appointed as Amicus Curiae, Shri Varun Mishra, the learned
counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri Vikramjeet
Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India for
the first respondent-Narcotics Control Bureau.
CONDITIONS OF BAIL
4. Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 (for short, ‘the
CrPC’) deals with the power of a Court of Sessions or a High Court
to grant bail in non-bailable offences. We are reproducing Section
439 for ready reference:
“439. Special powers of High Court or Court of Session
regarding bail.—(1) A High Court or Court of Session
may direct—
(a) that any person accused of an offence and in
custody be released on bail, and if the offence is of the
nature specified in sub-section (3) of Section 437, may
impose any condition which it considers necessary
for the purposes mentioned in that sub-section;
(b) that any condition imposed by a Magistrate when
releasing any person on bail be set aside or modified:
Provided that the High Court or the Court of Session
shall, before granting bail to a person who is accused
of an offence which is triable exclusively by the Court of
Session or which, though not so triable, is punishable
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 103
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
with imprisonment for life, give notice of the application
for bail to the Public Prosecutor unless it is, for reasons to
be recorded in writing, of opinion that it is not practicable
to give such notice:
[Provided further that the High Court or the Court of Session
shall, before granting bail to a person who is accused of
an offence triable under sub-section (3) of Section 376
or Section 376-AB or Section 376-DA or Section 376-DB
of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), give notice of the
application for bail to the Public Prosecutor within a period
of fifteen days from the date of receipt of the notice of
such application.]
[(1-A) The presence of the informant or any person
authorised by him shall be obligatory at the time of hearing
of the application for bail to the person under sub-section
(3) of Section 376 or Section 376-AB or Section 376-DA
or Section 376-DB of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)].
(2) A High Court or Court of Session may direct that any
person who has been released on bail under this Chapter
be arrested and commit him to custody.”
Section 437(3) reads thus:
“437. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable
offence.—
(1) …………………………………………………
(2)…………………………………………………
(3) When a person accused or suspected of the commission
of an offence punishable with imprisonment which may
extend to seven years or more or of an offence under
Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abetment of, or conspiracy
or attempt to commit, any such offence, is released on
bail under sub-section (1), the [Court shall impose the
conditions,—
(a) that such person shall attend in accordance with the
conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter,
104 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(b) that such person shall not commit an offence similar
to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected,
of the commission of which he is suspected, and
(c) that such person shall not directly or indirectly
make any inducement, threat or promise to any person
acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade
him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any
police officer or tamper with the evidence,
and may also impose, in the interests of justice, such
other conditions as it considers necessary.]
(4) …………………………………………”
4.1 In this case, we are concerned with the offences under the
NDPS Act which are punishable with imprisonment of seven
years or more. The provision relating to bail is contained in
Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which reads thus:
“37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable.—
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),—
(a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be
cognizable;
(b) no person accused of an offence punishable for
[offences under Section 19 or Section 24 or Section
27-A and also for offences involving commercial
quantity] shall be released on bail or on his own
bond unless—
(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity
to oppose the application for such release, and
(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the
application, the court is satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty
of such offence and that he is not likely to commit
any offence while on bail.
(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in
clause (b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the
limitations under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 105
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
1973 (2 of 1974), or any other law for the time being
in force on granting of bail]”
Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the Court’s power to grant bail is
constrained by Sub-section 1(b)(ii). However, once a case is made
out for a grant of bail in accordance with Section 37, the conditions
of bail will have to be in terms of Section 437(3) of the CrPC. The
reason is that because of Section 52 of the NDPS Act, the provisions
of the CrPC apply to the arrests made under the NDPS Act insofar
as they are not inconsistent with the NDPS Act.
5. Apart from conditions (a) to (c) in Section 437(3) of the CrPC, there
is a power to impose additional conditions “in the interest of justice”.
The scope of the concept of “interest of justice” in Section 437(3) of
the CrPC has been considered by this Court in the case of Kunal
Kumar Tiwari v. State of Bihar2. In paragraph 9, this Court held thus:
“9. There is no dispute that clause (c) of Section 437(3)
allows courts to impose such conditions in the interest
of justice. We are aware that palpably such wordings
are capable of accepting broader meaning. But such
conditions cannot be arbitrary, fanciful or extend
beyond the ends of the provision. The phrase “interest
of justice” as used under the clause (c) of Section
437(3) means “good administration of justice” or
“advancing the trial process” and inclusion of broader
meaning should be shunned because of purposive
interpretation.”
(emphasis added)
6. In view of Section 438(2)(iv) of the CrPC, while granting anticipatory
bail, the Court is empowered to impose the conditions as provided
in Section 437(3) of the Cr. PC. While dealing with the condition
which can be imposed while granting anticipatory bail, this Court,
in the case of Munish Bhasin v. State (NCT of Delhi)3, held thus:
“10. It is well settled that while exercising discretion
to release an accused under Section 438 of the Code
2 (2018) 16 SCC 74
3 [2009] 2 SCR 806 : (2009) 4 SCC 45
106 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
neither the High Court nor the Sessions Court would
be justified in imposing freakish conditions. There is no
manner of doubt that the court having regard to the facts
and circumstances of the case can impose necessary, just
and efficacious conditions while enlarging an accused on
bail under Section 438 of the Code. However, the accused
cannot be subjected to any irrelevant condition at all.”
(emphasis added)
7. A broader meaning cannot be assigned to the words “interest of
justice” in Section 437(3) of Cr. PC. By borrowing the language
used by this Court in the above decisions, we can say that the bail
conditions cannot be fanciful, arbitrary or freakish. The object of
imposing conditions of bail is to ensure that the accused does not
interfere or obstruct the investigation in any manner, remains available
for the investigation, does not tamper with or destroy evidence, does
not commit any offence, remains regularly present before the Trial
Court, and does not create obstacles in the expeditious conclusion
of the trial. The Courts have imposed a condition that the accused
should cooperate with the investigation when bail is granted before
filing the final report or chargesheet. Cooperating with the investigation
does not mean that the accused must confess. The conditions
incorporated in the order granting bail must be within the four corners
of Section 437(3). The bail conditions must be consistent with the
object of imposing conditions. While imposing bail conditions, the
Constitutional rights of an accused, who is ordered to be released
on bail, can be curtailed only to the minimum extent required. Even
an accused convicted by a competent Court and undergoing a
sentence in prison is not deprived of all his rights guaranteed by
Article 21 of the Constitution. This Court, in the case of State of
A.P. v. Challa Ramkrishna Reddy,4 reiterated the settled position
by holding as follows:
“22. Right to life is one of the basic human rights. It is
guaranteed to every person by Article 21 of the Constitution
and not even the State has the authority to violate that
right. A prisoner, be he a convict or undertrial or a detenu,
does not cease to be a human being. Even when lodged
4 [2000] 3 SCR 644 : (2000) 5 SCC 712
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 107
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
in the jail, he continues to enjoy all his fundamental
rights including the right to life guaranteed to him
under the Constitution. On being convicted of crime
and deprived of their liberty in accordance with the
procedure established by law, prisoners still retain
the residue of constitutional rights.”
(emphasis added)
7.1. We are dealing with a case of the accused whose guilt is
yet to be established. So long as he is not held guilty, the
presumption of innocence is applicable. He cannot be deprived
of all his rights guaranteed under Article 21. The Courts must
show restraint while imposing bail conditions. Therefore,
while granting bail, the Courts can curtail the freedom of
the accused only to the extent required for imposing the bail
conditions warranted by law. Bail conditions cannot be so
onerous as to frustrate the order of bail itself. For example,
the Court may impose a condition of periodically reporting to
the police station/Court or not travelling abroad without prior
permission. Where circumstances require, the Court may
impose a condition restraining an accused from entering a
particular area to protect the prosecution witnesses or the
victims. But the Court cannot impose a condition on the
accused to keep the Police constantly informed about his
movement from one place to another. The object of the bail
condition cannot be to keep a constant vigil on the movements
of the accused enlarged on bail. The investigating agency
cannot be permitted to continuously peep into the private
life of the accused enlarged on bail, by imposing arbitrary
conditions since that will violate the right of privacy of the
accused, as guaranteed by Article 21. If a constant vigil is
kept on every movement of the accused released on bail by
the use of technology or otherwise, it will infringe the rights of
the accused guaranteed under Article 21, including the right to
privacy. The reason is that the effect of keeping such constant
vigil on the accused by imposing drastic bail conditions will
amount to keeping the accused in some kind of confinement
even after he is released on bail. Such a condition cannot
be a condition of bail.
108 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
8. In view of sub-section (2) of Section 441 of the CrPC, the conditions
imposed by the Court while granting bail always stand incorporated
in the bail bond executed by the accused. Therefore, the accused is
bound by the conditions imposed while granting bail. If the accused,
after being enlarged on bail, commits a breach of bail conditions or
commits any offence, the Courts always have the power to cancel
the bail.
9. A condition cannot be imposed while granting bail which is impossible
for the accused to comply with. If such a condition is imposed, it
will deprive an accused of bail, though he is otherwise entitled to it.
CONDITION OF DROPPING PIN ON GOOGLE MAP
10. Firstly, we will deal with the issue of the condition of dropping a PIN
on Google Maps. The condition imposed on the appellant of dropping
a PIN on Google Map gives an impression that the condition will
enable the first respondent Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to monitor
the movements of the accused on a real-time basis, which will be
violative of the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India. To understand the technical aspects of “dropping
a PIN on Google Map”, we issued a notice to Google LLC, having
its office in the USA. Accordingly, Shri R. Suresh Babu, authorised
signatory of Google LLC, has filed an affidavit. Paragraphs 5 to 10
of his affidavit read thus:
“5. Google Maps is a web and app-based service that
enables users to search for and navigate to local places.
It inter alia offers real-time traffic conditions, and route
planning for travelling by foot, car, bike, air, and public
transportation. Google Maps can be accessed through the
Google Maps application available on mobiles or through
a web browser at www.google.com/maps.
6. One of the features available to users on Google
Maps is the ability of users to drop a ‘PIN’ on a
location of their choosing on the map. Dropping a
PIN, allows the user to mark or identify a location on
the map without necessarily requiring access to the
user’s location data. Users may drop a PIN either on
the mobile application or on the web browser. To drop a
PIN, a user may either:
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 109
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
a. press and hold the desired location where the
PIN is to be dropped on the map on the mobile
application; or
b. click on the desired location on the map on a
web browser.
7. Upon dropping the PIN, the user dropping the PIN can
identify the specific coordinates of the location on the map.
Through the Google Maps app or through a web browser,
the user dropping the PIN may opt to get directions to the
location, mark the location with a label, add a business
address to the location, or share the location with another
user.
8. The PIN identifies and marks a specific location of the
user’s choosing on Google Maps. The PIN need not be
dropped at the location where the user/the user’s device
is located at the time of sharing the PIN. The PIN dropped
and shared need not be the real-time location of the user
sharing the PIN.
9. Google Maps allows users to share information, such
as the PIN, with third parties. This is explained in Google’s
privacy policy, which is available at https:policies.google.
com/privacy?hI=en-US, and shares as follows: “Many of
our services let you share information with other people,
and you have control over how you share [emphasis
supplied]”. Users consent to the privacy policy when they
create a Google Account. In this case, if a user wants to
share a PIN, they can do so by clicking on the ‘share’
button. This generates a link to Google Maps that the
user can share with others through messaging platforms
or other modes of online communication. When clicked,
the link directs users (having access to the link) to the
location where the PIN was dropped on the map.
10. The Google Maps PIN feature, which includes the
creation of a PIN or the sharing of such a PIN with another
user, does not impinge on the user’s privacy as the user
has full control over sharing of such information. The
user with access to the link can only access the static
110 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
location pinned and shared on Google Maps. The pinned
location does not enable real-time tracking of the user
or their device. Even if the PIN were to coincide with a
user’s location at a given time, this would (a) be the static
location pinned by the user; and (b) only be accessible to
others when a user affirmatively shares the PIN with them
by clicking on the share button.”
(emphasis added)
10.1. In paragraph 10 of the affidavit, Google LLC stated that the user
has full control over sharing PINs with other users. Moreover,
it does not impinge on the user’s privacy, as the user retains
full control. Most importantly, it is stated that the PIN location
does not enable real-time tracking of the user or the user’s
device. Therefore, the condition of the accused dropping a pin
on Google Maps, as it stands, is completely redundant as the
same does not help the first respondent.
10.2. Imposing any bail condition which enables the Police/
Investigation Agency to track every movement of the accused
released on bail by using any technology or otherwise would
undoubtedly violate the right to privacy guaranteed under
Article 21. In this case, the condition of dropping a PIN on
Google Maps has been incorporated without even considering
the technical effect of dropping a PIN and the relevance of
the said condition as a condition of bail. This cannot be a
condition of bail. The condition deserves to be deleted and
ordered accordingly. In some cases, this Court may have
imposed a similar condition. But in those cases, this Court was
not called upon to decide the issue of the effect and legality
of such a condition.
THE CONDITION OF FURNISHING CERTIFICATE OF THE
EMBASSY
11. Now, we come to the decision of the Supreme Court Legal Aid
Committee1 relied upon by the High Court. In the first part of
paragraph 15, the prayers made in the petition filed before this Court
have been set out. We are quoting the relevant part of paragraph
15, which reads thus:
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 111
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
“15. But the main reason which motivated the Supreme
Court Legal Aid Society to file this petition under
Article 32 of the Constitution was the delay in the
disposal of cases under the Act involving foreigners.
The reliefs claimed included a direction to treat further
detention of foreigners, who were languishing in jails
as undertrials under the Act for a period exceeding two
years, as void or in any case they be released on bail
and it was further submitted by counsel that their cases
be given priority over others. When the petition came up
for admission it was pointed out to counsel that such an
invidious distinction between similarly situate undertrials
who are citizens of this country and who are foreigners
may not be permissible under the Constitution and even if
priority is accorded to the cases of foreigners it may have
the effect of foreigners being permitted to jump the queue
and slide down cases of citizens even if their cases are
old and pending since long. Counsel immediately realised
that such a distinction if drawn would result in cases of
Indian citizens being further delayed at the behest of
foreigners, a procedure which may not be consistent with
law. He, therefore, rightly sought permission to amend
the cause-title and prayer clauses of the petition which
was permitted. In substance the petitioner now prays that
all undertrials who are in jail for the commission of any
offence or offences under the Act for a period exceeding
two years on account of the delay in the disposal of cases
lodged against them should be forthwith released from jail
declaring their further detention to be illegal and void and
pending decision of this Court on the said larger issue,
they should in any case be released on bail. ………….”
(emphasis added)
In the same paragraph 15, directions have been issued which read
thus:
“We, therefore, direct as under:
(i) Where the undertrial is accused of an
offence(s) under the Act prescribing a
punishment of imprisonment of five years
112 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
or less and fine, such an undertrial shall
be released on bail if he has been in jail
for a period which is not less than half the
punishment provided for the offence with
which he is charged and where he is charged
with more than one offence, the offence
providing the highest punishment. If the
offence with which he is charged prescribes
the maximum fine, the bail amount shall be
50% of the said amount with two sureties
for like amount. If the maximum fine is not
prescribed bail shall be to the satisfaction
of the Special Judge concerned with two
sureties for like amount.
(ii) Where the undertrial accused is charged
with an offence(s) under the Act providing for
punishment exceeding five years and fine, such
an undertrial shall be released on bail on the
term set out in (i) above provided that his bail
amount shall in no case be less than Rs 50,000
with two sureties for like amount.
(iii) Where the undertrial accused is charged
with an offence(s) under the Act punishable
with minimum imprisonment of ten years and
a minimum fine of Rupees one lakh, such
an undertrial shall be released on bail if he
has been in jail for not less than five years
provided, he furnishes bail in the sum of
Rupees one lakh with two sureties for like
amount.
(iv) Where an undertrial accused is charged for the
commission of an offence punishable under
Sections 31 and 31-A of the Act, such an
undertrial shall not be entitled to be released
on bail by virtue of this order.
The directives in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall
be subject to the following general conditions:
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 113
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
(i) The undertrial accused entitled to be
released on bail shall deposit his passport
with the learned Judge of the Special Court
concerned and if he does not hold a passport,
he shall file an affidavit to that effect in the
form that may be prescribed by the learned
Special Judge. In the latter case the learned
Special Judge will, if he has reason to doubt the
accuracy of the statement, write to the Passport
Officer concerned to verify the statement and
the Passport Officer shall verify his record and
send a reply within three weeks. If he fails to
reply within the said time, the learned Special
Judge will be entitled to act on the statement
of the undertrial accused;
(ii) the undertrial accused shall on being released
on bail present himself at the police station which
has prosecuted him at least once in a month
in the case of those covered under clause (i),
once in a fortnight in the case of those covered
under clause (ii) and once in a week in the case
of those covered by clause (iii), unless leave of
absence is obtained in advance from the Special
Judge concerned;
(iii) the benefit of the direction in clauses (ii) and
(iii) shall not be available to those accused
persons who are, in the opinion of the learned
Special Judge, for reasons to be stated in
writing, likely to tamper with evidence or
influence the prosecution witnesses;
(iv) in the case of undertrial accused who are
foreigners, the Special Judge shall, besides
impounding their passports, insist on a
certificate of assurance from the Embassy/
High Commission of the country to which
the foreigner-accused belongs, that the said
accused shall not leave the country and
shall appear before the Special Court as and
when required;
114 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(v) the undertrial accused shall not leave the
area in relation to which the Special Court
is constituted except with the permission of
the learned Special Judge;
(vi) the undertrial accused may furnish bail by
depositing cash equal to the bail amount;
(vii) the Special Judge will be at liberty to cancel
bail if any of the above conditions are
violated or a case for cancellation of bail is
otherwise made out; and
(viii) after the release of the undertrial accused
pursuant to this order, the cases of those
undertrials who have not been released
and are in jail will be accorded priority and
the Special Court will proceed with them as
provided in Section 309 of the Code.”
(emphasis added)
However, paragraph 16 is relevant, which reads thus:
“16. We may state that the above are intended to
operate as one-time directions for cases in which the
accused persons are in jail and their trials are delayed.
They are not intended to interfere with the Special
Court’s power to grant bail under Section 37 of the Act.
The Special Court will be free to exercise that power
keeping in view the complaint of inordinate delay in
the disposal of the pending cases. The Special Court
will, notwithstanding the directions, be free to cancel bail
if the accused is found to be misusing it and grounds for
cancellation of bail exist. Lastly, we grant liberty to apply in
case of any difficulty in the implementation of this order.”
(emphasis added)
11.1. The directions contained in paragraph 15 were to operate
as one-time directions applicable only to the pending cases
of the accused who were in jail on the date of the judgment.
These conditions were required to be incorporated in the order
while releasing an accused on bail as a one-time measure.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 115
Frank Vitus v. Narcotics Control Bureau & Ors.
Paragraph 16 clarifies that if a bail application is made to the
Special Court with a grievance regarding inordinate delay
in the disposal of pending cases, the Special Court will be
empowered to exercise power to grant bail in light of what is
held in paragraph 15. Therefore, it is not necessary that in every
case where bail is granted to an accused in an NDPS case
who is a foreign national on the ground of long incarceration
of more than 50% of the minimum sentence, the condition of
obtaining a ‘certificate of assurance’ from the Embassy/High
Commission should be incorporated. It will depend on the
facts of each case.
12. Even if such a condition is incorporated, on an application made by
the accused, the concerned Embassy/High Commission declines or
fails to issue the certificate within a reasonable time, say within a
period of seven days, the Court always has the power to dispense
with the said condition. Grant of such a certificate by the Embassy/
High Commission is beyond the control of the accused to whom bail
is granted. Therefore, when the Embassy/High Commission does
not grant such a certificate within a reasonable time, as explained
above, the accused, who is otherwise held entitled to bail, cannot be
denied bail on the ground that such a condition, which is impossible
for the accused to comply with, has not been complied with. Hence,
the Court will have to delete the condition. If the Embassy/High
Commission records reasons for denying the certificate and the
reasons are based on the adverse conduct of the accused based
on material, the Court can always consider the reasons recorded
while considering an application for dispensing with the condition.
However, the Courts must remember that the accused has no right
to compel the Embassy/High Commission to issue such a certificate.
There can be very many reasons for recording adversely which again
cannot be the basis to deny bail already granted. In such a case,
instead of the condition of obtaining such a certificate, the condition
of surrendering the passport and regularly reporting to the local
police station/Trial Court can always be imposed, depending upon
the facts of each case.
13. Coming to the facts of the case, bail has been granted to the appellant
firstly on the ground that the appellant has been implicated based
on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, and that
such statements are entirely inadmissible in view of the decision
116 [2024] 7 S.C.R.

of this Court in the case of Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu 5.
So, bail has been granted on merits as well. Secondly, the bail has
also been granted relying upon what is held in paragraph 15 of the
decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee 1. As
the bail was granted on merits by relying upon the decision of this
Court in the case of Tofan Singh 2, there was no reason for the High
Court to have imposed all the onerous conditions incorporated in
paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal
Aid Committee 1.
14. Therefore, in view of the above discussion, we are of the view that it is
not necessary to refer the case to a larger Bench for reconsideration
of condition No. (iv) in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of
Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee1.
15. Based on our findings on the two issues mentioned above, we direct
that the two conditions in the order granting bail to the appellant,
namely, obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission
and dropping a pin of Google Maps, shall stand deleted.
16. The case shall be listed on 15 July 2024 for passing final orders after
considering the compliances made by the appellant so far.
Result of the case: Listed for final orders.

[Abhay S. Oka* and Rajesh Bindal, JJ.]","Whether the Courts below erred in convicting appellant u/s.302,
IPC for committing the murder of his stepmother by relying upon
the alleged extra-judicial confession of appellant before PW1 and
‘last seen together’ evidence of PW5; and the guilt of the appellant
was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.
","Penal Code, 1860 – s.302 – Prosecution case that Appellant
assaulted his step-mother; dragged her by holding her hair
from her house up to the village pond and suffocated her to
death by putting her head inside the pond water – No direct
evidence – Conviction by Courts below, relying upon alleged
extra-judicial confession of appellant before PW1-village
officer and ‘last seen together’ evidence of PW5 (deceased’s
brother) – If justified:
Held:1. The normal rule of human conduct is that if a person wants
to confess to the crime committed by him, he will do so before
the person in whom he has implicit faith. It is not the case of the
prosecution that the appellant had a close acquaintance with PW-1
for a certain length of time before the incident. Moreover, the version
of the witness in examination-in-chief and cross-examination is
entirely different. Therefore, the testimony of PW-1 is not reliable.
Hence, the case of extra-judicial confession cannot be accepted.
[Para 10]
2. Between the house of the deceased and the pond, there is a
road and ridge of the pond. This means the appellant must have
dragged the deceased for a considerable distance. The incident
happened in the evening before 7 p.m. There must be many people
around the place of the incident. None of them has been examined
as a witness. An adverse inference must be drawn against the

prosecution for not examining material witnesses. Moreover, in the
absence of injuries on the body of the deceased, it is very difficult
to accept the testimony of PW-5 that by holding the hair of his
mother, the appellant dragged her to the pond. Therefore, evidence
of PW-5 of last seen together is not worthy of acceptance. Guilt
of appellant not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant is

","Judgment
Abhay S. Oka, J.
1. The Sessions Court convicted the appellant-accused for the offence
punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (for short,
‘IPC’) for committing the murder of Smt Hemwati Bai, who was his
stepmother. Appellant was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment.
By the impugned judgment, the High Court has dismissed the appeal
preferred by the appellant.
FACTUAL ASPECT
2. The case of the prosecution in brief is that the appellant had a land
dispute with the deceased. The allegation against the appellant is
that on 2nd March 2013, he assaulted the deceased. After that, he
caught hold of the deceased by her hair and dragged her up to the
village pond. The appellant put her head inside the pond water.
The deceased was suffocated to death. The first informant–Darshu,
PW-4, informed the police that Hemwati Bai died due to drowning.
Accordingly, a First Information Report (for short, ‘FIR’) was registered.
After the completion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed
against the appellant. The prosecution examined ten witnesses.
There is no direct evidence. The prosecution relied upon evidence
of PW-1, Sukhmani Bai, the village officer. The prosecution case
is that the appellant made an extra-judicial confession before the
witness. The prosecution relied upon the evidence of PW-5, Chaprasi,
the deceased’s brother. According to PW-5, he saw the appellant
holding the hair of the deceased and was taking her towards the
pond. Though PW-1 was declared hostile, the Trial Court and High
Court relied upon a part of her testimony. The Courts also believed
the testimony of PW-5.

Ratnu Yadav v. The State of Chhattisgarh
SUBMISSIONS
3. Shri Shridhar Y. Chitale, learned counsel appearing for the appellant
as amicus curiae, has taken us through the postmortem report and
testimony of relevant prosecution witnesses. Based on the evidence
of PW-9, Dr Pankaj Kishore, his submission is that the death was due
to drowning, and the prosecution has not discharged the burden on
it to prove that it was a homicidal death. He submitted that evidence
of PW-1, who was declared as hostile, cannot be believed as in the
examination-in-chief, the witness did not depose that the appellant
made a confession of killing the deceased. However, in the cross-
examination made by the public prosecutor, the witness purportedly
stated that the appellant confessed before her about killing the
deceased. He submitted that evidence of PW-1 cannot be believed.
As regards the evidence of PW-5, he stated that though the witness
deposed that he saw the appellant dragging the deceased towards
the pond, PW-2 – Bisoha, who was allegedly present at that time, did
not support the prosecution. Moreover, another witness, Lakhan, was
allegedly present there and was not examined by the prosecution. He
pointed out that the incident happened in the evening and PW-10,
Investigating Officer admitted that there is a temple near the house
of the deceased and other people lived nearby. He would, therefore,
submit that the prosecution has failed to prove the appellant’s guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.
4. Shri Prashant Singh, learned counsel appearing for the respondent
State, submitted that in her cross-examination made by the public
prosecutor, PW-1 has clearly deposed about the confessional
statement made by the appellant. He submitted that evidence of a
hostile witness need not be rejected in its entirety and that the Court
can always rely upon a part of the testimony of such a witness.
He submitted that the evidence of PW-5 proves that the appellant
was last seen together with the deceased, and at that time, he was
holding the deceased by her hair. He submitted that this evidence
is sufficient to hold that the death of the deceased is homicidal. He
submitted that in view of the oral testimony of the said two witnesses,
the appellant’s guilt has been established.
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS
5. We have carefully perused the evidence of prosecution witnesses
and other documents on record. The prosecution is relying upon the
470 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
extra-judicial confession made by the appellant before PW-1 and
evidence of PW-5 of last seen together. The case of the prosecution is
that after an altercation with the deceased in her house, the appellant
held the deceased by her hair and dragged her to the village pond.
The prosecution is relying upon a site map. It shows that a road
separates the pond and the house of the deceased. The sketch
shows the existence of a ridge around the pond and two temples
on the ridge of the pond abutting the road. The temples are exactly
opposite the house of the deceased. According to the prosecution
case, the appellant dragged the deceased by holding her hair from
her house up to the pond. Between the house of the deceased
and the pond, there is a road and ridge of the pond. This means
the appellant must have dragged the deceased for a considerable
distance. The postmortem report records explicitly that no marks of
any injury were found on the body of the deceased. In his evidence,
PW-9 Dr Pankaj Kishore reiterated that there was no injury mark on
the body of the deceased. If the prosecution story of the appellant
dragging the deceased was true, there would have been some injury
on the body of the deceased. Therefore, the absence of any injury
marks on the body militates against the prosecution’s case.
6. Evidence of PW-9 shows that salt water was found in the trachea
and lungs of the deceased. Perhaps to find out whether the water
found in the trachea and lungs of the deceased was the water in
the pond, samples of water from the pond were collected and sent
to the laboratory. That is what PW-10, the Investigating Officer, has
stated in paragraph 11 of his deposition. He further stated that the
Director of the State Judicial Laboratory returned the samples without
testing them on the ground that the cause of death was established
in the postmortem notes.
7. According to PW-9, the cause of death was due to drowning; however,
he was unable to state whether the death was homicidal or accidental.
The reason is that it was difficult for him to state whether deceased
immersed in the water herself or she was forced into water. In fact,
in postmortem notes, PW-9 stated that an expert’s opinion should
be sought. Admittedly, an expert’s opinion was not sought.
8. Now, we turn to evidence of PW-1. She was a village Kotwal. She
was a signatory to the panchnama of the recovery of the dead body
and a signatory to the sketch of the site made by the police. In the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 471
Ratnu Yadav v. The State of Chhattisgarh
examination-in-chief, she stated that on the date of the incident,
around 7 p.m., the appellant came to her house and stated that his
mother had died. She has not deposed in her examination-in-chief
that the appellant stated that he had killed the deceased. A Statement
under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short,
‘CrPC’) of the witness was recorded by the police. Obviously, as the
said witness made a departure from what she had stated in the police
statement, at the instance of the public prosecutor, the witness was
declared hostile. The cross-examination of the witness by the public
prosecutor shows that the witness was not confronted by showing
the relevant part of her statement recorded under Section 161 of
CrPC. The witness ought to have been confronted with her prior
statement in accordance with Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act.
However, in the cross-examination made by the public prosecutor,
the witness accepted the suggestion given by the public prosecutor
that the appellant came to her house at 7 p.m. on the date of the
incident and told her that he had killed his stepmother by putting
her head into the village pond.
9. As regards the evidentiary value of an extra-judicial confession, a
bench of three Hon’ble Judges of this Court in the case of Devi Lal
v. State of Rajasthan1, in Paragraph 11, this Court held thus:
“11. It is true that an extra-judicial confession is
used against its maker but as a matter of caution,
advisable for the court to look for a corroboration
with the other evidence on record. In Gopal Sah v.
State of Bihar [Gopal Sah v. State of Bihar, (2008)
17 SCC 128 : (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 466] , this Court
while dealing with extra-judicial confession held that
extra-judicial confession is, on the face of it, a weak
evidence and the Court is reluctant, in the absence
of a chain of cogent circumstances, to rely on it, for
the purpose of recording a conviction. In the instant
case, it may be noticed that there are no additional cogent
circumstances on record to rely on it. At the same time,
Shambhu Singh (PW 3), while recording his statement
under Section 164 CrPC, has not made such statement
of extra-judicial confession (Ext. D-5) made by accused
1 [2019] 1 SCR 168 : (2019) 19 SCC 447
472 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Babu Lal. In addition, no other circumstances are on
record to support it.”
(emphasis added)
In paragraph 16 of the decision of this Court in the case of Nikhil
Chandra Mondal v. State of West Bengal2, this Court held thus:
“16. It is a settled principle of law that extra-judicial
confession is a weak piece of evidence. It has been held
that where an extra-judicial confession is surrounded
by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes
doubtful and it loses its importance. It has further
been held that it is well-settled that it is a rule of
caution where the court would generally look for an
independent reliable corroboration before placing any
reliance upon such extra-judicial confession. It has
been held that there is no doubt that conviction can be
based on extra-judicial confession, but in the very nature
of things, it is a weak piece of evidence.”
(emphasis added)
10. The normal rule of human conduct is that if a person wants to confess
to the crime committed by him, he will do so before the person in
whom he has implicit faith. It is not the case of the prosecution that
the appellant had a close acquaintance with PW-1 for a certain
length of time before the incident. Moreover, the version of the
witness in examination-in-chief and cross-examination is entirely
different. Therefore, in our considered view the testimony of PW-1
is not reliable. Hence, the case of extra-judicial confession cannot
be accepted.
11. Now, we come to the testimony of PW-5. At the beginning of his
examination-in-chief, he stated that the deceased was his elder sister.
He stated that there was an altercation between the deceased and
the appellant in her house. Thereafter, the appellant caught hold of
the deceased by her hair, and he slammed her. At that time, PW-2,
Bisoha was present. The witness further stated that by holding his
mother’s hair, the appellant took her towards the pond. At that time,
one Lakhan came there and tried to tell the appellant that he should
2 [2023] 2 SCR 20 : (2023) 6 SCC 605
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 473
Ratnu Yadav v. The State of Chhattisgarh
not do such acts with his mother. The appellant abused him and
forced him to leave. It is pertinent to note that PW-2 Bisoha did not
support the prosecution and was declared hostile. More importantly,
Lakhan, who has allegedly seen the appellant dragging the deceased
with her hair, has not been examined as a witness.
12. As admitted by PW-10, Investigating Officer, there is a temple near
the deceased’s house, and other people live nearby. The incident
happened in the evening before 7 p.m. There were two temples
on the ridge of the pond. Obviously, there must be many people
around the place of the incident. None of them has been examined
as a witness. Moreover, the officer stated that it was not revealed
during the investigation that the deceased shouted. An adverse
inference must be drawn against the prosecution for not examining
material witnesses, including Lakhan. Considering the evidence of
PW-5, Lakhan was a very crucial witness. The prosecution has not
explained his non-examination. PW-2, Bisoha has not supported
the prosecution. Moreover, in the absence of injuries on the body
of the deceased, it is very difficult to accept the testimony of PW-5
that by holding the hair of his mother, the appellant dragged her to
the pond. Therefore, evidence of PW-5 of last seen together is not
worthy of acceptance.
13. Considering what we have held earlier, the appellant’s guilt was not
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant was incarcerated
for 11 years.
14. Hence, the impugned judgment and order dated 7th April 2018 and
9th July 2013 are hereby set aside. The appellant is acquitted of
the offence registered with FIR No. 68 of 2013 of Police Station
Kharora, district Raipur. The appellant shall be immediately set at
liberty unless his custody is required in any other case. The appeal
is, accordingly, allowed.
Result of the case: Appeal allowed.

money towards the dues arising under the alleged illegal deductions

hit by s. 22(1) – Furthermore, the legislature did not intend to
include even the proceedings for the adjudication of the liabilities
not admitted by a sick company within the protective ambit of s.

of the defendant towards the plaintiff, and does not threaten the

Held: Applying the mischief rule to s. 22(1), it is found there
was a vacuum in the legal framework to deal with sick industrial
companies and provide ameliorative steps for their revival – 1985
Act was enacted to fill in this vacuum – Mischief which was sought
to be dealt with by the enactment of s. 22 was any such legal
proceeding which could impact the assets of the sick company
and in-turn negatively impact the formulation and implementation of
the rehabilitative scheme – This provision was inserted to provide
a remedy by ensuring that the multiple recourses available under
the law for recovery of debts, etc. were suspended for the period
during which the sick company was under the ameliorative shelter
of the BIFR – It was to shield the formulation and implementation
of the revival scheme from any impediments thereby maximising
the chances of revival of sick company, the ultimate object sought
to be achieved by the Act. [Para 101]

Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary

on the principal decretal amount – Claim of – High Court
granted 24%pa compound interest on the principal decretal
amount in favour of the original plaintiff-small-scale industrial
undertaking from the original defendants, from the date the
amounts were determined to have become due till the date
of their realisation by the original plaintiff, setting aside the
decree of the trial court which granted 12% simple interest
in favour the original plaintiff – Correctness:
Held: High Court committed no error in awarding 24% interest
to the original plaintiff on its dues as per the provisions of the
1993 Act – However, the period during which the defendant
company was a sick company as per the 1985 Act is excluded
for the purposes of calculation of interest – For the period during
which the defendant company was sick and before the BIFR, it
cannot be said that the withholding of the payment of the dues
of the original plaintiff was wilful and intentional – Liability of the
original defendants was disputed and was finally adjudicated
only by way of the impugned judgment, much after the BIFR
proceedings had come to an end; and even if the liability of the
original defendants was not disputed, or was even acknowledged
before the BIFR, recovery of the same could not have been done
without the permission of the BIFR in view of the suspension of
recovery proceedings by s. 22(1) of the 1985 Act – Thus, the
period commencing from the date when original defendant was
declared to be a sick company under the 1985 Act going up to
the date when it was discharged by the BIFR and declared to be
no longer a sick industrial company is excluded from the purview
of the applicability of the interest provision under the 1993 Act –
Interest would not be calculated for the aforesaid period – Thus,
the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is upheld
subject to the modification of the period for which interest may be
granted – Interest would be calculated at 24% p.a. with monthly
compounding. [Paras 140-143]

Digital Supreme Court Reports
Interpretation of Statutes – Principle of harmonious
construction – Interplay between the Sick Industrial
Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 and the Interest
on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial
Undertakings Act, 1993:
Held: Doctrine of harmonious construction is based on the
principle that the legislature would not lightly take away from one
hand what it had given with the other – Doctrine provides, that
as far as possible, two seemingly conflicting provisions within a
statute, or the seemingly conflicting provisions of one statute vis
a vis another, should be construed in a manner so as to iron out
any conflict – Beneficial provisions of the 1985 Act, was enacted
to maximise the chances of revival of sick industrial companies,
while the 1993 Act, was enacted with the intention to ensure
that small-scale industries are paid their dues in time – This
object of the 1993 Act was sought to be achieved by providing
a high interest rate, with monthly compounding, so as to act
as a deterrent for the buyers – Interest of justice requires that
both the 1985 Act and the 1993 Act, which are in the nature of
beneficial enactments, should be read harmoniously so as to
impart a meaningful construction to the language of each of the
enactments. [Paras 119, 125, 136]
Interest – Grant of interest – Concept of :
Held: When interest is awarded by the Court, normal feeling is
that it is so awarded by way of penalty or punishment, however,
interest in all cases is not granted by way of penalty or punishment
– Interest on the delayed payment of the claim amount accrues
due to the continuing wrong committed by the wilful withholding
of the payment towards the claim, resulting in a continuous injury
until such payment is made, or in other words, until the claim is
realised. [Paras 106, 107]

A. FACTUAL MATRIX
1. Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are the same;
the parties are also the same and the challenge is also to the self-
same impugned common judgment and order passed by the High
Court, those were taken up for hearing analogously and are being
disposed of by this common judgment and order.
2. The appellants herein are the original defendants and the respondent
herein is the original plaintiff.
3. The present appeals arise from the impugned common judgment and
order dated 10.06.2022 (“impugned judgment”) passed by the High
Court of Telangana at Hyderabad partly allowing the Appeal Suit No.
808 of 2002 and Appeal Suit No. 913 of 2004 respectively preferred
by the original defendants and the original plaintiff respectively against
the judgment and decree dated 19.09.2001 passed by the Senior
Civil Judge, Peddapalli in O.S. No. 37 of 1996 decreeing the suit
partly in favour of the original plaintiff.
4. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited, that is, the original plaintiff,
is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 established
with the assistance of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Development
Corporation Limited (“APIDC”) and is engaged in the manufacturing
of High Density Poly Ethylene (“HDPE”) bags.
5. Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (“FCIL”), that is, the defendant
company, is a Public Sector Undertaking (“PSU”) of the Government of
India established for the manufacturing of fertilisers and are operating
under the administrative control of the Ministry of Chemicals and
Fertilizers, Government of India.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 329
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
6. The original defendants required HDPE bags for the purpose of
packaging and supply of fertiliser to their customers. They had been
placing orders for the same with the original plaintiff since 1986-87
onwards. The terms and conditions including the technical specifications
of the bags and terms of payment were specified in the notices inviting
tender (“NIT”) issued from time to time and the purchase orders
issued in pursuance thereof. As per the terms of the NIT, the original
defendants were required to make the entire payment within 20 days
of the receipt of the bags and approval of the same. The terms of the
purchase orders also entitled the original defendants to deduct up to
a maximum of 5% of the contract price towards liquidated damages
upon delay in supply of bags by the original plaintiff.
i. Case of the original plaintiff before the trial court
7. The case of the original plaintiff before the trial court was that the
original defendants placed with it certain purchase orders for the
supply of the HDPE bags, which were manufactured by it as per the
specifications and duly supplied periodically. The purchase orders
were amended from time to time to account for the increase in the
number of bags which were required by the original defendants.
It was the case of the original plaintiff that in pursuance of the
communications exchanged with the original defendants, it supplied
42,000 bags over and above the quantity mentioned in the purchase
orders to meet with the urgent requirements of the original defendants,
on the understanding that a subsequent purchase order would be
issued to account for the extra supply.
8. The grievance of the original plaintiff was that when a formal purchase
order was subsequently issued by the original defendants to account
for the extra bags supplied by the original plaintiff, the price per
bag mentioned in the said order fell short of the price agreed upon
between the parties. The original plaintiff was also aggrieved by the
deductions made by the original defendants towards the liquidated
damages for the alleged delay in supply of the bags and the penalty
imposed towards the supply of the alleged poor quality of the bags.
The original plaintiff also claimed to have suffered losses due to the
refusal of the original defendants to accept 25,000 bags after placing
the order, which were printed as per the specifications prescribed
by the original defendants and had to be sold as scrap due to non-
acceptance by the original defendants.

9. With a view to recover the aforesaid losses, the original plaintiff
instituted the civil suit for the recovery of Rs 8,27,100.74/- along
with Rs 10,31,803.14/- towards interest up to the date of institution
of the suit. A detailed break-up of the claim of the original plaintiff
before the trial court is as follows:

i.e., from Rs. 8.75/bag to Rs. 10.25/bag

ii. Case of the original defendants before the trial court
10. The original defendants filed their written statement before the trial
court stating that there was no discrepancy in the purchase order
issued subsequent to the supply of the extra bags and that the
imposition of liquidated damages was justified as per the terms
of the NIT and the purchase orders. It was also stated that the
deductions imposed as penalty for the supply of poor quality of
the bags was also justified and interest @ 24% was not liable to
be imposed.
11. The original defendants further stated before the trial court that as
they had been declared to be a sick company under Section 3(1)
(o) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985
(“the 1985 Act”), the suit for recovery was not maintainable as per
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act and thus was liable to be dismissed.
12. The trial court, having regard to the specific pleadings of the parties
proceeded to frame 10 issues as tabulated hereinbelow.

10. Whether the suit of the plaintiff was Decided in favour of the

13. On the issue of applicability of Section 22 of the 1985 Act, it was
observed thus by the trial court:
“Both sides have not argued on this issue and no material
is produced before the Court and no evidence is also
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 333
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
adduced on this issue. Hence, the defendant company
failed to prove that it is a sick industry and the plaintiff’s
suit is maintainable. I answer this issue in favour of the
Plaintiff accordingly”
14. The final decree drawn by the trial court reads thus:
""1. That the suit of the plaintiff be and is hereby decreed.
2. That the defendants 1 to 4 be and are hereby directed
to pay Rs. 55,710/-, Rs. 100,848 and Rs. 1,18,000/- to
the plaintiff together with interest @ 12% per annum
from 01.01.1994 till realization.
3. That the defendants 1 to 4 be and are hereby further
directed to pay Rs. 1,72,734/- to the plaintiff together
with interest @ 12% per annum from 16.07.1994 till
realization.
4. That the suit of the plaintiff for the rest of the claim
of Rs. 4,89,919/- be and is hereby dismissed.
5. That the defendants do pay Rs. 37,169/- to the plaintiff
towards the costs of the suit.”
iii. Appeals before the High Court
15. Both the parties went to the High Court in appeal against the aforesaid
decision of the trial court. The original plaintiff contended before the
High Court, inter alia, that the deductions towards the liquidated
damages and penalty were wrongly imposed on it by the original
defendants, and that the interest at the rate of 24% with monthly
compounding ought to have been granted on the delayed payments
in light of the provisions of the Interest on Delayed Payments to
Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 (“the
1993 Act”).
16. The original defendants on the other hand contested that the trial
court had failed to consider the evidence properly and had wrongly
awarded the amounts under different heads to the original plaintiff.
The contention as to the applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985
Act was also raised by the original defendants.
17. The High Court, vide the impugned judgment partly allowed both
the appeals. The original defendants were allowed to deduct an
334 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
amount of Rs 1,63,471/- towards the liquidated damages, whereas
the original plaintiff was allowed to recover the amounts deducted
towards penalty, price difference in the supply of 42,000 bags and the
loss incurred due to the refusal of the original defendants to accept
the delivery of 25,000 bags. Pertinently, the High Court accepted
the contention of the original plaintiff on the issue of interest and
granted 24% compound interest on the amounts due.
18. Despite recording the submissions of the parties on the applicability of
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, neither any point for determination was
framed nor any finding was returned on the same by the High Court.
19. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, more particularly as regards
the awarding of 24% interest in favour of the original plaintiff –
which has inflated the principal decretal amount to one of mammoth
proportions – the original defendants are before this Court with the
present appeals.
B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS/
ORIGINAL DEFENDANTS
20. Ms. Malvika Trivedi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the original defendants submitted that the 1985 Act overrides the
1993 Act as the same was enacted in the larger public interest by
the Parliament with a view to secure the directive specified under
Article 39 of the Constitution.
21. It was further submitted that the 1993 Act having been enacted to
provide for and regulate the payment of interest on delayed payments
to the small-scale industries, does not envisage a situation where an
industrial undertaking becomes sick and requires a scheme for its revival.
22. It was argued that the provisions of the 1985 Act should be given
the widest possible import in light of the fact that the same is a self-
contained code containing provisions like the statutory bar on civil
suits for recovery of money from sick industrial companies under
Section 22 and the non-obstante clause under Section 32 by virtue
of which the provisions of the 1985 Act are given an overriding
effect. Reliance was placed by the learned senior counsel upon the
decisions of this Court in Jay Engineering Works Ltd. v. Industry
Facilitation Council reported in (2006) 8 SCC 677 and Tata Motors
Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. reported in (2008)
7 SCC 619.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 335
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
23. It was further submitted that the impugned judgment and order passed
by the High Court failed to take into consideration the law settled by
this Court in Bhoruka Textiles Ltd. v. Kashmiri Rice Industries
reported in (2009) 7 SCC 521 which held that if the jurisdiction of
the civil court was ousted in terms of the jurisdictional bar imposed
under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, then any judgment rendered by
it would be coram non-judice and as a result a nullity.
24. To fortify her aforesaid submission, the learned senior counsel argued
that the facts of the present case are similar to the facts in Bhoruka
Textiles (supra) as follows:
I. The defendant company was declared as a sick industrial
undertaking under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act and was
referred to the BIFR for its revival on 06.11.1992 and an
enquiry under Section(s) 16 and 17 respectively of the 1985
Act was pending in respect of the defendant company at the
time of the institution of the suit by the original plaintiff before
the trial court.
II. The suit for recovery of money was instituted by the original
plaintiff against the original defendants without obtaining the
consent of the BIFR, as mandated by Section 22 of the 1985 Act.
III. Despite the statutory bar under Section 22 against the institution
of a suit for the recovery of money, the trial court decided the suit
and decreed it. Even the High Court in the impugned judgment
failed to decide the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the trial court
in deciding the suit.
25. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the contention of
the original plaintiff that the statutory bar under Section 22 of the
1985 Act applies only against a recognized creditor and such debts
as are acknowledged before the BIFR during the pendency of the
reference application is not the correct understanding of the law and
is against the beneficial object of the Act. It was contended that the
reliance placed by the original plaintiff on the decision of the Delhi
High Court in Sunil Mittal Properties of Shree Shyam Packaging
Industries v. M/s LML Ltd. reported in (2011) 123 DRJ 249 is
misplaced as the said decision failed to consider the law settled by
this Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) and thus could be termed
as per incuriam.
336 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
26. One another submission made by the learned senior counsel was that
out of the total claim put forward by the original plaintiff before the trial
court, only the amount of Rs 55,710/- could have been recognized
as delayed payment. It was submitted that the deductions made by
the original defendants towards liquidated damages and penalty
while remitting the payment to the original plaintiff could not have
been classified as delayed payment for the purpose of computation
of interest under the 1993 Act and the interest could only have been
claimed on the undisputed and agreed upon sum under the contract.
27. It was argued that the liability, if any, of the original defendants to pay
interest on the amount of Rs 4,89,919.99/- should be limited from
the date of the impugned judgment, wherein the High Court while
partially modifying the decree awarded by the trial court, awarded the
amount as above in favour of the original plaintiff for the first time.
28. It was also argued that the High Court erred in interfering with the
exercise of discretion by the trial court in awarding 12% pendente
lite interest in favour of the original plaintiff.
29. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the original plaintiff
had the option of taking recourse to the mechanism prescribed under
Section 6 of the 1993 Act which provides for making a reference of any
dispute to the Industry Facilitation Council for acting as an arbitrator
or a conciliator. However, by consciously approaching the civil court
by way of a suit for recovery of money despite the jurisdictional bar
contained under Section 22 of the Act, the original plaintiff must now
face the consequences of approaching a non-jurisdictional forum.
30. Lastly, it was submitted by the learned senior counsel that the
defendant company remained under BIFR for a period of 21
years and was revived in 2013 after intervention of the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs. The economic distress caused by
the enforcement of the liability imposed upon the original defendants
by the High Court may potentially overwhelm the efforts at revival
of the defendant company.
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT/
ORIGINAL PLAINTIFF
31. Mr. Sundeep Pothina, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the original plaintiff submitted at the outset that Section 22 of the
1985 Act is not applicable to the instant case as neither the debt
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 337
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
came to be acknowledged, nor the name of the creditor company
figured before the BIFR. Since, in the case on hand, the original
defendants did not include the liability of the original plaintiff in their
list of liabilities in accordance with Section 21(a)(i) of the 1985 Act
nor in their book of accounts under Section 21(a)(ii) of the 1985 Act
nor did it include the original plaintiff company in the list of creditors
under Section 21(b) of the 1985 Act at the time of reference or
thereafter, the jurisdictional bar available under Section 22 of the
1985 Act cannot be said to be applicable to the suit instituted by
the original plaintiff.
32. It was further submitted that the reliance placed by the original
defendants on Bhoruka Textiles (supra) in support of their contention
regarding Section 22 of the 1985 Act is misplaced for the following
reasons:
I. This Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) decided the issue as to
whether the bar under Section 22 of the 1985 Act would apply
to a suit for recovery instituted for defaults occurring post the
reference of the sick industrial company to the BIFR when the
reference was pending. However, the issue in the present case
is different and pertains to whether a suit for determination of
‘illegal deductions’ and ‘breach of contract’ and liability would
be barred by virtue of Section 22 of the Act.
II. In Bhoruka Textiles (supra), not only the debt but the creditor
was also acknowledged before the BIFR and there was no
dispute on the issue or size of default. However, in the present
case, both the existence and quantum of liability are under
dispute. The original defendants have not referred to the original
plaintiff as a ‘creditor’ before any forum.
33. It was further argued that the reliance placed by the original defendants
on Jay Engineering (supra) is also of no avail as in the facts of
that case, there was no dispute over the quantum of dues and the
sick company therein had reckoned the dues and the liabilities were
covered in the revised rehabilitation scheme. Further, the decision
in the said case only supports the contention of the original plaintiff
that the adjudicatory process of making an award is not barred under
Section 22 of the 1985 Act and it is only the execution of such an
award against a sick company which is protected under Section
22 of the 1985 Act. Thus, as the civil court in this case was the
338 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
adjudicating authority having inherent jurisdiction to decide the suit
under Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, the adjudicatory
part of determining the liability couldn’t be said to have been barred
by Section 22 of the Act. It is only the execution of such a decree
arrived at as a result of the adjudicatory process which could be
said to be barred under Section 22 of the 1985 Act during the period
when the sick company is under the protection of the BIFR.
34. The learned counsel further submitted that the reliance placed
by the original defendants on the decision of this Court in Tata
Motors (supra) is also misplaced as the said decision pertains
to Section 26 of the 1985 Act while the case on hand pertains to
the applicability of Section 22 of the 1985 Act. He contended that
even the said decision supports the case of the original plaintiff
as it explains the distinction between the adjudicatory authority
of a civil court and the BIFR and holds that the jurisdiction of a
civil court is barred in respect of any matter for which the BIFR or
the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction
(“AAIFR”) is empowered.
35. The learned counsel, while placing reliance on the decision of the
Delhi High Court in Sunil Mittal (supra), argued that the facts of
the present case are squarely covered by the said decision. It was
submitted that in the said case, a distinction was drawn between the
‘process of assessment’ and ‘quantified recoveries’ and it was held
that while the realisation of the latter is stayed by virtue of Section
22 of the 1985 Act, the former, which is the process of finalisation
of liability, does not get stayed by operation of Section 22 of the
1985 Act.
36. The learned counsel submitted that the contention of the original
defendants that the decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) is rendered
per-incuriam as the same failed to consider the decision in Bhoruka
Textiles (supra) is incorrect as the court therein had based its
decision on the judgment of a division bench of the Delhi High Court
in Saketh India Limited v. W. Diamond India Ltd. reported in 2010
SCC OnLine Del 1786. The decision in Saketh India (supra) has
exhaustively considered the various decisions of this Court on the
issue of applicability of jurisdictional bar under Section 22 of the
1985 Act and thus the decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) cannot be
characterised as per-incuriam.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 339
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
37. The learned counsel submitted that the High Court in its impugned
judgment has determined the issue of rate of interest under Section
4 of the 1993 Act. The High Court, after looking into the relevant
material, observed that the floor rate charged by the State Bank of
India (“SBI”) for the financial year 1993-94 was 19% and thus awarded
interest at 24% which is 5 per-cent points above the floor rate.
38. The learned counsel, in the last, submitted that as opposed to the
representations made by the defendant company about its current
financial status, the net worth of the defendant company as on
31.03.2022 is in the positive and is at the least not less than 2,000/-
crores.
D. ANALYSIS
39. Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side,
we would like to briefly discuss the proceedings in respect of the
defendant company before the Board for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction (“BIFR”) in terms of Section 15 of the 1985 Act.
i. Proceedings in respect of FCIL before the BIFR
40. At the end of financial year 1991-92, the defendant company
suffered huge erosion in its net worth and became a sick industrial
company. Accordingly, a reference was made to the BIFR in terms
of Section 15 of the 1985 Act. Thereafter, the BIFR after hearing the
representatives and stakeholders declared the defendant company
to be a sick company under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act vide
its order dated 06.11.1992. The BIFR also granted FCIL and the
Government of India time till 31.03.1993 to submit their final plan
for rehabilitating the company.
41. During the entire period of adjudication of the suit by the trial court
and for a part of the period during the pendency of the appeals
before the High Court, the defendant company continued to remain
a Sick Industrial company with a Special Director appointed by the
BIFR and the SBI appointed as the Operating Agency.
42. On 09.05.2013, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (“CCEA”)
met and took decisions on the revival of the defendant company.
The Government of India waived off its loan and interest amounting
to Rs. 10,643/- crore and the debt owed to the other PSUs were
settled at 30% of their respective dues as on 31.03.2003.
340 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
43. Meanwhile, the BIFR in the course of one important hearing looked
into the progress towards the revival of the defendant company in
detail. After taking into account the developments over the course
of 20 years, the BIFR issued the following relevant directions: -
“i. The company, M/s Fertilizer Corpn. Of India (Case No.
515/1992) ceases to be a Sick Industrial Company, within
the meaning of Section 3(1)(o) of the SICA as its net-worth
has turned positive. It is therefore, de-registered from the
purview of SICA/BIFR.
xxx xxx xxx
iv. The Board discharges the State Bank of India from
the responsibility of Operating Agency (OA) to the Board.
v. All Secured Creditors, Statutory Authorities are at liberty
to recover their dues, if any, according to law.”
44. Thus, in view of the directions of the BIFR dated 27.06.2013 referred
to above, the defendant company ceased to be a Sick Industrial
company during the pendency of the appeals before the High Court.
45. The submissions of the original defendants were focussed on and
limited to the following two aspects – jurisdictional bar on the civil
court in deciding the suit instituted by the original plaintiff by virtue
of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act; and the legality & validity of the
interest rate of 24% per annum awarded by the High Court in the
original plaintiff’s favour.
ii. Issues for Determination
46. Having heard the parties extensively on the aforesaid aspects and
having perused the materials on record, the following two questions
fall for our consideration:
I. Whether the suspension of legal proceedings as envisaged
under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would extend to a civil suit
for recovery of money even if the debt sought to be proved in
the plaint has not been admitted by the sick industrial company?
If so, whether the decree in favour of the original plaintiff could
be said to be coram non-judice?
II. Whether the High Court was correct in granting 24% compound
interest on the principal decretal amount in favour of the original
plaintiff?

iii. Overview of Industrial Sickness and the Legislative Scheme
of the 1985 Act.
47. Before we proceed to answer the aforesaid issues, we would like
to discuss briefly the concept of industrial sickness, the legislative
scheme of the 1985 Act and the object behind its enactment. This will
help us develop a better contextual understanding of the questions
before us.
48. Sickness in industries is a natural fall-out of industrialisation. Industrial
sickness can be understood to refer to a situation wherein an industrial
unit fails to generate surplus and is incurring losses over a period
of time resulting in the erosion of its net-worth. Section 3(o) of the
1985 Act defines a ‘sick industrial company’ to be one which at the
end of a financial year accumulates losses equal to or exceeding
its net worth.
49. While there could be numerous causes of sickness, the mismanagement
of the industrial unit, faulty planning at the inception of an industry,
technical drawbacks, recession in the market, labour disputes,
changes in the fiscal policies of the government, unavailability of
credit facilities, and non-availability of raw-materials are some of the
prominent factors causing industrial sickness.
50. As the Indian economy transitioned from being an agriculture-intensive
one towards a more industry-centric one, a growing number of
industries suffered huge financial losses resulting in their closure,
which in turn led to the loss of employment, government revenue and
locking up of the investible funds of banks and financial institutions
which were invested in setting up of those industries. In order to
curb industrial sickness and its detrimental impacts on the Indian
economy, many policies and legislations were enacted over the
years by the executive and the legislative wing respectively. The aim
of such enactments was two-fold – first, to reduce the incidence of
sickness in industries by promoting a conducive industrial climate
and secondly, to identify sick companies and take effective remedial
steps for revival of such companies and upon failure, to wind them up.
51. One of the first such enactments was the Industrial Development and
Regulation Act, 1951 (“IDRA Act, 1951”) which contained provisions
empowering the Central Government to cause investigation into the
affairs of an Industrial Company which is to be wound up for the
342 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
purpose of reviving such Company in the interest of general public
by ensuring production, supply or distribution of articles.
52. Nationalisation of sick industries through legislations was another
approach adopted by the government to revive or continue the
operation of sick industries in national interest. An enactment brought
in with the object of dealing with sickness in the textile industry
was the Sick Textile Undertaking (Nationalization) Act, 1974 which,
inter alia, provided for the reorganisation and rehabilitation of sick
textile industries. Similarly, The Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd.
(Acquisition and Transfer of Aluminium Undertaking) Act, 1984 and
The Futwah Islampur Lightway Line (Nationalisation) Act, 1985 were
enacted with similar objects.
53. Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India Act, 1984 was enacted to
provide financial assistance to sick industrial companies for their
revival. However, the said enactment was repealed thereafter.
54. In 1981, the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) appointed a committee
under the chairmanship of late Shri T. Tiwari to look into the causes
of industrial sickness, to assess the depth of the problem and to
suggest comprehensive and focussed remedial measures to counter
the problem of industrial sickness in India. The committee submitted
its report suggesting, inter alia, the setting up of a quasi-judicial
body through a special legislation to handle the cases of industrial
sickness. This suggestion of the committee led to the enactment of
the 1985 Act.
55. The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Sick
Industrial Companies Bill, 1985 reads as follows:
“The ill effects of sickness in industrial companies such as
loss of production, loss of employment, loss of revenue
to the Central and State Governments and locking up of
investible funds of banks and financial institutions are of
serious concern to the Government and the society at large.
The concern of the Government is accentuated by the
alarming increase in the incidence of sickness in industrial
companies. It has been recognised that in order to fully
utilise the productive industrial assets, afford maximum
protection of employment and optimise the use of the
funds of the banks and financial institutions, it would be
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 343
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
imperative to revive and rehabilitate the potentially viable
sick industrial companies as quickly as possible. It would
also be equally imperative to salvage the productive assets
and realise the amounts due to the banks and financial
institutions, to the extent possible, from the non-viable
sick industrial companies through liquidation of those
companies.
2. It has been the experience that the existing institutional
arrangements and procedures for revival and rehabilitation
of potentially viable sick industrial companies are both
inadequate and time-consuming. A multiplicity of laws and
agencies makes the adoption of coordinated approach
for dealing with sick industrial companies difficult. A need
has, therefore, been felt to enact in public interest a
legislation to provide for timely determination by a body of
experts of the preventive, ameliorative, remedial and other
measures that would need to be adopted with respect to
such companies and for enforcement of the measures
considered appropriate with utmost practicable despatch.
3. The salient features of the Bill are-
(i) Application of the legislation to the industries specified
in the First Schedule to the Industries (Development
and Regulation) Act. 1951, with the initial exception
of the scheduled industry relating to ships and other
vessels drawn by power, which may however be
brought within the ambit of the legislation in due
course:
(ii) identification of sickness in an industrial company,
registered for not less than seven years, on the basis
of the symptomatic indices of cash losses for two
consecutive financial years and accumulated losses
equalling or exceeding the net worth of the company
as at the end of the second financial year,
(iii) the onus of reporting sickness and impending
sickness at the stage of erosion of fifty per cent, or
more of the net worth of an industrial company is
being laid on the Board of Directors of such company;
344 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
where the Central Government or the Reserve Bank
is satisfied that an industrial company has become
sick, it may make a reference to the Board, likewise
if any State Government, scheduled bank or public
financial institution having an interest in an industrial
company is satisfied that the industrial company has
become sick, it may also make a reference to the
Board;
(iv) establishment of Board consisting of experts in
various relevant fields with powers to enquire into
and determine the incidence of sickness in industrial
companies and devise suitable remedial measures
through appropriate schemes or other proposals and
for proper implementation thereof;
v) constitution of an Appellate Authority consisting
of persons who are or have been Supreme Court
Judges, senior High Court Judges and Secretaries
to the Government of India, etc. for hearing appeals
against the order of the Board.
4. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the
various provisions of the Bill.
NEW DELHI
THE 22nd August, 1985. VISHWANATH PRATAP SINGH”
56. The preamble to the 1985 Act reads as follows:
“An Act to make, in the public interest, special provisions
with a view to securing the timely detection of sick and
potentially sick companies owning industrial undertakings,
the speedy determination by a Board of experts of the
preventive, ameliorative, remedial and other measures
which need to be taken with respect to such companies
and the expeditious enforcement of the measures so
determined and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto.”
57. Having discussed the object behind the enactment of the 1985 Act
and the developments leading up to its inception, we shall now briefly
discuss the scheme and scope of the 1985 Act.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 345
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
58. The 1985 Act is divided into four chapters. The first chapter contains
preliminary provisions including the definitions and a declaration that
the 1985 Act is enacted in furtherance of the principles enshrined in
clauses (b) and (c) of the Article 39 of the Constitution. The second
chapter, inter alia, provides for the establishment of the BIFR and
the AAIFR and prescribes the term of office and conditions of service
of their chairperson and members and also the procedure to be
followed by them.
59. The third chapter, which is often described as the soul and essence
of the 1985 Act, provides for the methodology that is to be adopted
for the purposes of detecting, reviving or even winding up a sick
industrial company. Section 15 enables the Board of Directors of
a company which has become sick to make reference to BIFR for
determination of measures which shall be adopted with respect to
the company. The Central Government or the Reserve Bank or the
State Government concerned may also make the reference to the
BIFR for the same purpose if it has sufficient reasons to believe that
a company has become sick. Once a reference is made, it is open to
the BIFR to conduct an inquiry for determining whether the company
has become sick. If the BIFR is satisfied on completion of the inquiry
that the company has become sick, it can adopt any of the measures
envisaged in Section 17 of the 1985 Act. When an order is made
under Section 17 a scheme with respect to the company shall be
prepared by “the operating agency” specified in such order under
Section 18. The operating agency may also be directed by the BIFR
under Section 21 to prepare, inter alia, an inventory of the books of
account of the sick company and its assets and liabilities, a list of
shareholders and secured and unsecured creditors, a valuation report
in respect of the shares and the assets etc. Section 20 provides for
the winding up of a sick company where the BIFR is of the opinion
that such a company is not likely to become viable in the future.
Section 22, which is at the heart of the dispute before us, inter alia,
provides for the suspension of legal proceedings of the nature as
specified in the said section.
60. The fourth chapter, among other things, provides for the detection of
potentially sick companies in the initial stages by mandating the Board
of Directors of such companies to bring such potential sickness to
the knowledge of the BIFR and the shareholders of the companies.
Punishment of up to two years imprisonment along with fine is also
346 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
prescribed in case of default in complying with the requirement. The
issue of mismanagement leading to sickness in companies is sought
to be dealt with under Section 24 of the 1985 Act which provides
strict measures in case of proved misfeasance, breach of trust, etc.
Section 26 bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of matters
which the BIFR or the AAIFR are empowered to determine. Section
32 is the non-obstante provision which imparts overriding effect to
the 1985 Act over other laws in force except for the two legislations
mentioned in the said section itself. The 1985 Act was repealed by
the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003
which was notified on 01.12.2016.
61. Having discussed in detail the scheme of the 1985 Act and the object
and purpose behind its enactment, we shall now proceed to answer
the issues framed by us.
iv. Issue No. 1: Whether the suspension of legal proceedings
as envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would
extend to a civil suit for recovery of money even if the debt
sought to be proved in the plaint has not been admitted
by the sick industrial company? If so, whether the decree
in favour of the original plaintiff could be said to be coram
non-judice?
62. To answer the issue before us, it is important to first delineate the
scope of the relevant provision, which is reproduced hereinbelow:
“22. Suspension of legal proceedings, contracts, etc.—
(1) Where in respect of an industrial company, an inquiry
under section 16 is pending or any scheme referred to
under section 17 is under preparation or consideration or
a sanctioned scheme is under implementation or where an
appeal under section 25 relating to an industrial company
is pending, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the
Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) or any other law or the
memorandum and articles of association of the industrial
company or any other instrument having effect under the
said Act or other law, no proceedings for the winding up
of the industrial company or for execution, distress or the
like against any of the properties of the industrial company
or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof and
no suit for the recovery of money or for the enforcement
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 347
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
of any security against the industrial company or of any
guarantee in respect of any loans or advance granted
to the industrial company shall lie or be proceeded with
further, except with the consent of the Board or, as the
case may be, the Appellate Authority….”
63. Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act provides that subject to the fulfilment
of the conditions as described in the sub-section, proceedings of
the nature mentioned therein shall remain suspended in respect of
a sick industrial company.
64. For the bar under the said sub-section to get attracted, it is necessary
that in respect of an industrial company:
I. An inquiry under Section 16 of the 1985 Act is pending; OR
II. A scheme under Section 17 of the 1985 Act is under preparation
or consideration; OR
III. A sanctioned scheme is under implementation; OR
IV. An appeal under Section 25 of the 1985 Act is pending.
65. If one of the four conditions as mentioned aforesaid is fulfilled, then
notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, 1956 or
any other law or the memorandum and articles of association of
the industrial company or any other instrument having effect under
the Companies Act, 1956 or other law, proceedings in the nature of
the following cannot be initiated, and if already initiated, cannot be
proceeded with, except with the consent of the BIFR or the AAIFR,
as the case may be:
I. Winding up of the industrial company;
II. Execution, distress or the like against any of the properties of
the industrial company;
III. Appointment of receiver in respect of any of the properties of
the industrial company;
IV. Suit for recovery of money from the industrial company;
V. Suit for enforcement of a security against the industrial company;
VI. Suit for enforcement of a guarantee in respect of loans or
advance granted to the industrial company.
348 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
66. It is pertinent to mention that prior to the coming into force of the Sick
Industrial Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 w.e.f. 01.02.1994, the
proceedings in the nature of a suit as mentioned in (iv), (v) and (vi) in
paragraph 65 above were exempt from the ambit of the suspension
as envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
67. Thus, as can be seen from the plain reading of Section 22(1) of the
1985 Act, for an industrial company to avail the benefit of suspension
of legal proceedings, two conditions have to be fulfilled – First, one
of the four requirements as mentioned in paragraph 64 should be
satisfied, that is, the industrial company must be at the prescribed
stage of proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR. Secondly, the
nature of proceedings sought to be suspended should be one which
falls within the ambit of proceedings mentioned in paragraph 65 above.
68. We shall first examine whether the first of the two conditions as
mentioned above is satisfied, as the protective shield of Section
22(1) of the 1985 Act is only available so long as the proceedings
before the BIFR or the AAIFR are pending. It was observed by a
three-judge bench of this Court in Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v.
Church of South India Trust Association CSI CINOD Secretariat,
Madras reported in (1992) 3 SCC 1 thus:
“….We are, therefore, of the opinion that the passing of the
interim order dated February 21, 1991 by the Delhi High
Court staying the operation of the order of the Appellate
Authority dated January 7, 1991 does not have the effect
of reviving the appeal which had been dismissed by the
Appellate Authority by its order dated January 7, 1991
and it cannot be said that after February 21, 1991, the
said appeal stood revived and was pending before the
Appellate Authority. In that view of the matter, it cannot
be said that any proceedings under the Act were pending
before the Board or the Appellate Authority on the date
of the passing of the order dated August 14, 1991 by the
learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court for
winding up of the company or on November 6, 1991 when
the Division Bench passed the order dismissing O.S.A.
No. 16 of 1991 filed by the appellant-company against the
order of the learned Single Judge dated August 14, 1991.
Section 22(1) of the Act could not, therefore, be invoked
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 349
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
and there was no impediment in the High Court dealing
with the winding up petition filed by the respondents…”
(Emphasis supplied)
69. As discussed hereinbefore in paragraph 40 of the judgment, the
Board of Directors of the defendant company, passed a resolution
dated 20.04.1992 to the effect that the company had become a sick
company for the purposes of the 1985 Act and thus a reference to
the BIFR was required to be made. In accordance with the resolution,
a reference was accordingly made under Section 15(1) of the 1985
Act. Subsequently, a bench of the BIFR took up the reference of
the defendant company for consideration and vide order dated
06.11.1992, inter alia, decided that the company fulfilled all the
criteria prescribed under Section 3(1)(o) of the 1985 Act for being
declared a sick company. The bench also granted the defendant
company and the Government of India time till 31.03.1993 to submit
a proposal for rehabilitation of the company for the consideration
of the bench.
70. The defendant company continued to remain a sick company under
the 1985 Act and proceedings before the BIFR continued and it was
only on 27.06.2013, after a detailed consideration of the progress
made by the company towards revival, that the BIFR declared the
defendant company to have ceased to be a sick industrial company.
Consequently, the defendant company was deregistered from BIFR
on the said date.
71. It is the case of the original defendants that the original civil suit
for the recovery of money having been filed against the defendant
company during the pendency of proceedings before the BIFR, the
trial court committed an error in deciding the suit despite the statutory
bar as envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
72. From a perusal of the facts as discussed above, it is clear that the
civil suit was instituted by the original plaintiff on 21.11.1996, that
is, indeed, during the pendency of the proceedings in respect of
the defendant company before the BIFR. Thus, the first condition
precedent for the applicability of the restriction under Section 22(1)
of the 1985 Act being satisfied, the only aspect that is now required
to be determined is whether the suit instituted by the original plaintiff
was of a nature as contemplated under Section 22(1).
350 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
73. From a bare reading of the provision, it appears that any ‘suit for
recovery of money’ against a sick industrial company shall not lie or
be proceeded with during the pendency of the proceedings in respect
of such a company before the BIFR or the AAIFR, except with the
permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, as the case may be. However,
it has been contended by the original plaintiff that it is not a suit for
recovery of money simpliciter is not barred under the provision, and
only such suits for recovery of money which are instituted towards
recovery of liabilities admitted by the sick company before the BIFR
that fall within the protective ambit of Section 22(1).
74. In other words, the contention of the original plaintiff is that if a suit
for recovery of money is brought against a sick company during the
pendency of proceedings before the BIFR or the AAIFR with respect
to the recovery of an acknowledged debt, then such a suit will be
hit by Section 22(1) and cannot lie or be proceeded with except
with the permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, as the case may be.
75. This Court including many of the High Courts have had the occasion
of interpreting Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. One of the earliest
decisions concerning Section 22(1) was rendered by a two-Judge
Bench of this Court in Gram Panchayat and Another v. Shree
Vallabh Glass Works Limited and Others reported in (1990) 2
SCC 440. In the said case, while deciding an appeal against the
decision of the Bombay High Court quashing recovery proceedings
towards property taxes and other amounts due under the provisions
of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1959 against the respondent
company therein, which had been declared to be a sick company
under the Act, the Bench held:
“5. The question is whether the Panchayat could not recover
the amount due to it from out of the properties of the sick
industrial company without the consent of the Board?
xxx xxx xxx
7. Section 22(1) provides that in case the enquiry under
Section 16 is pending or any scheme referred to under
Section 17 is under preparation or consideration by the
Board or any appeal under Section 25 is pending then
certain proceedings against the sick industrial company
are to be suspended or presumed to be suspended.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 351
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
The nature of the proceedings which are automatically
suspended are: (1) Winding up of the industrial company;
(2) Proceedings for execution, distress or the like
against the properties of sick industrial company; and
(3) Proceedings for the appointment of receiver. The
proceedings in respect of these matters could, however,
be continued against the sick industrial company with
the consent or approval of the Board or of the appellate
authority as the case may be.
xxx xxx xxx
10. In the light of the steps taken by the Board under
Sections 16 and 17 of the Act, no proceedings for execution,
distress or the like proceedings against any of the properties
of the company shall lie or be proceeded further except
with the consent of the Board. Indeed, there would be
automatic suspension of such proceedings against the
company’s properties. As soon as the inquiry under Section
16 is ordered by the Board, the various proceedings set
out under sub-section (1) of Section 22 would be deemed
to have been suspended.
11. It may be against the principles of equity if the creditors
are not allowed to recover their dues from the company,
but such creditors may approach the Board for permission
to proceed against the company for the recovery of their
dues/outstandings/overdues or arrears by whatever
name it is called. The Board at its discretion may accord
its approval for proceeding against the company. If the
approval is not granted, the remedy is not extinguished. It
is only postponed. Sub-section (5) of Section 22 provides
for exclusion of the period during which the remedy is
suspended while computing the period of limitation for
recovering the dues.
12. In our opinion, the High Court was justified in quashing
the recovery proceedings taken against the properties of
the company and we accordingly, reject this petition, with
no order as to costs.”

76. One another decision interpreting Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was
delivered by a two-judge bench of this Court in Maharashtra Tubes
Ltd. v. State Industrial & Investment Corpn. of Maharashtra
Ltd. reported in (1993) 2 SCC 144. In this case, this Court, while
deciding the interplay between the power of recovery under the State
Financial Corporations Act, 1951 and the suspension of certain legal
proceedings under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, held thus:
“10. It was next contended that the right conferred on the
Financial Corporation by Section 29 of the 1951 Act is not a
‘legal proceeding’ but merely an action permitted by statute
and, therefore, Section 22(1) will have no application as
it only bars legal proceedings for the winding up of any
industrial company or for execution, distress or the like
against any of its properties or for the appointment of a
Receiver in respect thereof. Now Section 22(1) uses the
expression ‘proceedings’ and not ‘legal proceedings’ which
expression is albeit used in the marginal note to the said
provision. Mr Rao contended that Section 22 must be
read in the light of the marginal note and when so read it
becomes obvious that only legal proceedings of the type
mentioned in sub-section (1) thereof are barred and not the
exercise of a right such as the one conferred by Section
29 of the 1951 Act. In support of his contention that the
marginal note can be used as an aid to interpretation he
invited our attention to a seven-Judge Bench decision of
this Court in Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. State of
Bihar [(1955) 2 SCR 603, 636 : AIR 1955 SC 661 : (1955)
6 STC 446] . In that case the marginal note to Article 286
of the Constitution was referred to and it was said that it
furnished some clue as to the meaning and purpose of
the Article. But at the same time the Court pointed out
that unlike the marginal notes in the statutes of the British
Parliament, the various Articles of the Constitution were
passed by the Constituent Assembly with the marginal
notes and, therefore, the Court considered it permissible
to use the marginal note to understand the meaning and
purport of the Article. But so far as statutes are concerned
this Court in the case of Board of Muslim Wakfs, Rajasthan
v. Radha Kishan [(1979) 2 SCC 468] held in no uncertain
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 353
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
terms that the weight of the authority was in favour of
the view that the marginal note appended to a section
cannot be used for construing the section (see paragraph
24 at p. 479). Section 22(1) shorn of the irrelevant part
provides that where an appeal under Section 25 relating
to an industrial company is pending, then, notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law, no proceedings for
the winding up of the industrial company or for execution,
distress or the like against any of the properties of the
industrial company or for appointment of a Receiver in
respect thereof shall lie or be proceeded with further,
except with the consent of the BIFR or, as the case may
be, the appellate authority. The purpose and object of this
provision is clearly to await the outcome of the reference
made to the BIFR for the revival and rehabilitation of the
sick industrial company. The words ‘or the like’ which follow
the words ‘execution’ and ‘distress’ are clearly intended to
convey that the properties of the sick industrial company
shall not be made the subject-matter of coercive action
of similar quality and characteristic till the BIFR finally
disposes of the reference made under Section 15 of the said
enactment. The legislature has advisedly used an omnibus
expression ‘the like’ as it could not have conceived of all
possible coercive measures that may be taken against
a sick undertaking. The action contemplated by Section
29 of the 1951 Act is undoubtedly a coercive measure
directed at the take over of the management and property
of the industrial concern and confers a further right on the
Financial Corporation to transfer by way of lease or sale
the properties of the said concern and any such transfer
effected by the Financial Corporation would vest in the
transferee all rights in or to the transferred property as if
the transfer was made by the owner of the property. So
also under the said provision the Financial Corporation
will have the same rights and powers with respect to
goods manufactured or produced wholly or partly from
goods forming part of the security held by it as it had with
respect to the original goods. It is, therefore, obvious on a
plain reading of Section 29 of the 1951 Act that it permits
354 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
coercive action against the defaulting industrial concern
of the type which would be taken in execution or distress
proceedings; the only difference being that in the latter
case the concerned party would have to use the forum
prescribed by law for the purpose of securing attachment
and sale of property of the defaulting industrial concern
whereas in the case of a Financial Corporation that right
is conferred on the creditor corporation itself which is
permitted to take over the management and possession of
the properties and deal with them as if it were the owner of
the properties. If the Corporation is permitted to resort to the
provision of Section 29 of the 1951 Act while proceedings
under Sections 15 to 19 of the 1985 Act are pending it
will render the entire process nugatory. In such a situation
the law merely expects the corporation and for that matter
any other creditor to obtain the consent of the BIFR or,
as the case may be, the appellate authority to proceed
against the industrial concern. The law has not left them
without a remedy. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
the word ‘proceedings’ in Section 22(1) cannot be given
a narrow or restricted meaning to limit the same to legal
proceedings. Such a narrow meaning would run counter
to the scheme of the law and frustrate the very object and
purpose of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.”
(Emphasis supplied)
77. The decisions in Gram Panchayat (supra) and Maharashtra Tubes
(supra) considered the unamended Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
However, the said provision came to be amended by the Sick
Industrial Companies (Amendment) Act, 1994 which came into effect
from 01.02.1994. The suit in question before us having been filed
in 1996, it is the amended Section 22(1) which would apply. Thus,
we shall now look into some of the decisions wherein the amended
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act was interpreted.
78. The question whether proceedings for the recovery of dues
arising after the sanctioning of the scheme would also be covered
under the protective umbrella of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act
fell for the consideration of a two-judge bench of this Court in
Deputy Commercial Tax Officer and Others v. Corromandal
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 355
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
Pharmaceuticals and Others reported in (1997) 10 SCC 649. This
Court, while answering the issue in the negative, distinguished the
facts before it from the decisions in Gram Panchayat (supra) and
Maharashtra Tubes (supra) and held thus:
“13. On a fair reading of the provisions contained in Chapter
III of Act 1 of 1986 and in particular Sections 15 to 22,
we are of the opinion that the plea put forward by the
Revenue is reasonable and fair in all the circumstances
of the case. Under the statute, the BIFR is to consider in
what way various preventive or remedial measures should
be afforded to a sick industrial company. In that behalf,
BIFR is enabled to frame an appropriate scheme. To enable
the BIFR to do so, certain preliminaries are required to be
followed. It starts with the reference to be made by the
Board of Directors of the sick company. The BIFR is directed
to make appropriate inquiry as provided in Sections 16 and
17 of the Act. At the conclusion of the inquiry, after notice
and opportunity afforded to various persons including the
creditors, the BIFR is to prepare a scheme which shall come
into force on such date as it may specify in that behalf.
It is in implementation of the scheme wherein various
preventive, remedial or other measures are designed
for the sick industrial company, steps by way of giving
financial assistance etc. by Government, banks or other
institutions, are contemplated. In other words, the scheme
is implemented or given effect to, by affording financial
assistance by way of loans, advances or guarantees or
reliefs or concessions or sacrifices by Government, banks,
public financial institutions and other authorities. In order
to see that the scheme is successfully implemented and
no impediment is caused for the successful carrying out
of the scheme, the Board is enabled to have a say when
the steps for recovery of the amounts or other coercive
proceedings are taken against sick industrial company
which, during the relevant time, acts under the guidance/
control or supervision of the Board (BIFR). Any step for
execution, distress or the like against the properties of
the industrial company or other similar steps should not
be pursued which will cause delay or impediment in the
356 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
implementation of the sanctioned scheme. In order to
safeguard such state of affairs, an embargo or bar is
placed under Section 22 of the Act against any step for
execution, distress or the like or other similar proceedings
against the company without the consent of the Board
or, as the case may be, the appellate authority. The
language of Section 22 of the Act is certainly wide. But,
in the totality of the circumstances, the safeguard is only
against the impediment, that is likely to be caused in the
implementation of the scheme. If that be so, only the
liability or amounts covered by the scheme will be taken
in, by Section 22 of the Act. So, we are of the view that
though the language of Section 22 of the Act is of wide
import regarding suspension of legal proceedings from the
moment an inquiry is started, till after the implementation
of the scheme or the disposal of an appeal under Section
25 of the Act, it will be reasonable to hold that the bar or
embargo envisaged in Section 22(1) of the Act can apply
only to such of those dues reckoned or included in the
sanctioned scheme. Such amounts like sales tax, etc.,
which the sick industrial company is enabled to collect
after the date of the sanctioned scheme legitimately
belonging to the Revenue, cannot be and could not have
been intended to be covered within Section 22 of the Act.
Any other construction will be unreasonable and unfair and
will lead to a state of affairs enabling the sick industrial
unit to collect amounts due to the Revenue and withhold
it indefinitely and unreasonably. Such a construction which
is unfair, unreasonable and against the spirit of the statute
in a business sense, should be avoided.
14. The situation which has arisen in this case seems to be
rather exceptional. The issue that has arisen in this appeal
did not arise for consideration in the two cases decided
by this Court in Gram Panchayat v. Shree Vallabh Glass
Works Ltd. [(1990) 2 SCC 440] and Maharashtra Tubes
Ltd. v. State Industrial & Investment Corpn. of Maharashtra
Ltd. [(1993) 2 SCC 144] It does not appear from the above
two decisions of this Court nor from the decisions of the
various High Courts brought to our notice, that in any one
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 357
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
of them, the liability of the sick company dealt with therein
itself arose, for the first time after the date of sanctioned
scheme. At any rate, in none of those cases, a situation
arose whereby the sick industrial unit was enabled to
collect tax due to the Revenue from the customers after
the “sanctioned scheme” but the sick unit simply folded
its hands and declined to pay it over to the Revenue, for
which proceedings for recovery, had to be taken. The
two decisions of this Court as also the decisions of High
Courts brought to our notice are, therefore, distinguishable.
They will not apply to a situation as has arisen in this
case. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Section 22(1)
should be read down or understood as contended by the
Revenue. The decision to the contrary by the High Court
is unreasonable and unsustainable. We set aside the
judgment of the High Court and allow this appeal. There
shall be no order as to costs.”
(Emphasis supplied)
79. The decision in Corromandal Pharmaceuticals (supra) was referred
to and relied upon by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Jay
Engineering (supra) which set aside the order of the High Court as
it failed to consider that the liabilities of the appellant-sick company
therein with respect to the creditor were indisputably a part of the
revised rehabilitation scheme. This Court held that if the liabilities of
the creditor were duly considered and made a part of the rehabilitation
scheme, the bar under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would apply,
notwithstanding the fact that the liabilities arose after the company
was declared to be a sick one. The relevant observations of this
court are extracted hereinbelow:
“9. In the said scheme, the award made in favour of
the respondents finds place in the category of “dormant
creditors”. The liabilities of the appellant vis-à-vis
Respondent 2 were, therefore, indisputably a subject-
matter of the said scheme. The High Court, in our opinion,
committed an error in proceeding on the premise that
the awarded amount had not been included and could
not be included in the sanctioned rehabilitation scheme,
the same being part of transactions which took place
358 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
after 21-11-1997 ignoring the revised scheme made in
the year 2003.
xxx xxx xxx
18. The award of the Council being an award, deemed
to have been made under the provisions of the 1996
Act, indisputably is being executed before a civil court.
Execution of an award, beyond any cavil of doubt, would
attract the provisions of Section 22 of the 1985 Act.
Whereas an adjudicatory process of making an award
under the 1993 Act may not come within the purview of
the 1985 Act but once an award made is sought to be
executed, it shall come into play. Once the awarded amount
has been included in the scheme approved by the Board,
in our opinion, Section 22 of the 1985 Act would apply.
19. If the liabilities of the appellant are covered by the
scheme framed under Section 22 of the 1985 Act, the High
Court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that
the provisions thereof are not attracted only because the
debt had been incurred after the Company was declared
to be a sick one.
xxx xxx xxx
22. The High Court has placed strong reliance on CTO
v. Corromandal Pharmaceuticals [(1997) 10 SCC 649]
wherein this Court was considering an exceptional situation
by reason of the fact that the liability of the sick company
for the first time arose after the date of sanctioned scheme
and the sick industrial unit was enabled to collect tax due to
the Revenue from the exporters thereafter but declined to
pay it over to the Revenue wherefor recovery proceedings
had to be taken. This Court categorically opined that
there cannot be any impediment in the enforcement of
the scheme. Section 22 of the 1985 Act provides for a
safeguard against impediment that is likely to be caused
in the implementation of the scheme. Section 22 was
also held to be of wide import as regards suspension of
legal proceedings from the moment, the inquiry is started
till after the implementation of the scheme or disposal
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 359
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
of the scheme under Section 25 of the 1985 Act. It was
categorically held:
“… it will be reasonable to hold that the bar or embargo
envisaged in Section 22(1) of the Act can apply only to
such of those dues reckoned or included in the sanctioned
scheme….”
The ratio laid down in the said decision, therefore, instead
of assisting the respondent assists the appellant.”
(Emphasis supplied)
80. The original defendants have strongly relied upon the decision of a
two-judge bench of this Court in Bhoruka Textiles (supra). In the
said case, the respondent therein, filed a suit for recovery against
the appellant, a sick industrial company. The civil court decreed
the suit in favour of the respondent therein with the finding that the
transaction referred to took place subsequent to the reference of
the appellant company to the BIFR and thus the suspension under
Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would not apply. The civil court also
held that in the absence of any final order declaring the appellant
company as a sick company by the BIFR, mere reference of the said
company to the BIFR would not bring the protection under Section
22(1) of the 1985 Act into effect.
81. This Court negatived both the findings noted above and held that the
civil court committed a manifest error in holding that the transaction
in question was subsequent to the reference, when from the admitted
facts it was apparent that it took place prior to the referral. It was
observed by the Bench thus:
“7. Chapter III of the Act provides for reference, enquiries
and schemes. Section 15 of the Act provides for reference
to the Board in terms whereof the Board of Directors of
the company is required to make a reference within 60
days from the date of the duly audited accounts of the
company for the financial year as at the end of which the
company has become a sick industrial company. Such
reference is made for determination of the measures
which may be adopted with respect to the company. The
proviso appended thereto, however, entitles the Board of
Directors to make a reference within 60 days from the
360 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
date of formation of the opinion that the company had
become a sick industrial company before the audited
accounts of the financial year in question are finalised.
Section 16 of the Act empowers the Board to make such
enquiry as it may deem fit for determining whether any
industrial company has become a sick industrial company,
inter alia, upon receipt of a reference with respect to such
company under Section 15.
xxx xxx xxx
10. Section 22 of the Act must be interpreted giving a plain
meaning to its contents. An enquiry in terms of Section
16 of the Act by the Board is permissible upon receipt of
a reference. Thus, reference having been made on 27-
12-2001 and the suit having been filed on 17-12-2002,
the receipt of a reference must be held to be the starting
period for proceeding with the enquiry.
11. The effect of the provisions of the Act has been
considered by a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court
in Tata Motors Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India
Ltd. [(2008) 7 SCC 619] wherein it, in no uncertain terms,
held that SICA is a special statute and, thus, overrides
other Acts like the Companies Act, 1956, stating: (SCC
p. 635, paras 31-33)
“31. SICA furthermore was enacted to secure the
principles specified in Article 39 of the Constitution
of India. It seeks to give effect to the larger public
interest. It should be given primacy because of its
higher public purpose. Section 26 of SICA bars the
jurisdiction of the civil courts.
32. What scheme should be prepared by the operating
agency for revival and rehabilitation of the sick
industrial company is within the domain of BIFR.
Section 26 not only covers orders passed under
SICA but also any matter which BIFR is empowered
to determine.
33. The jurisdiction of the civil court is, thus, barred in
respect of any matter for which the Appellate Authority
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 361
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
or the Board is empowered. The High Court may not
be a civil court but its jurisdiction in a case of this
nature is limited.”
12. If the civil court’s jurisdiction was ousted in terms of the
provisions of Section 22 of the Act, any judgment rendered
by it would be coram non judice. It is a well-settled principle
of law that a judgment and decree passed by a court or
tribunal lacking inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity. In
Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan [AIR 1954 SC 340] this
Court held: (AIR p. 342, para 6)
“6. … It is a fundamental principle well established
that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction
is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up
whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced
or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and
even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction,
whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is
in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes
at the very authority of the court to pass any decree,
and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent
of parties.”
(See also Chief Engineer, Hydel Project v. Ravinder Nath
[(2008) 2 SCC 350 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 940] , SCC p.
361, para 26.)”
(Emphasis supplied)
82. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Raheja Universal Limited v.
NRC Limited and Others reported in (2012) 4 SCC 148 undertook
a comprehensive study of the various decisions of this Court on the
interpretation of Section 22 of the 1985 Act to clarify the divergences
and settle the position of law on the said provision. The relevant
observations are as follows:
“23. The provisions of SICA 1985 impose an obligation on
the sick industrial companies and potentially sick industrial
companies to make references to BIFR within the time
specified under SICA 1985. Default thereof is punishable
under the provisions of SICA 1985. Largely, the proceedings
before BIFR are specific to rehabilitation or winding up of
362 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the sick company and SICA 1985 hardly contemplates
adversarial proceedings. The bodies constituted under
SICA 1985 would least exercise their jurisdiction to a lis
between any party or upon the rival interests of the parties.
xxx xxx xxx
30. Dealing with the language of Section 22 of SICA 1985,
this Court in Jay Engg. case [(2006) 8 SCC 677 : AIR 2006
SC 3252] took the view that the said Act shall prevail and
though the adjudicatory process of making an award under
the 1993 Act would not come under the purview of SICA
1985, once an award is made and sought to be executed,
the provisions of Section 22 of SICA 1985 shall take over
and such award would not be executable against the sick
company, particularly when the party in whose favour the
award was made was, as in the present case, included
in the category of dormant creditors of the sick company.
xxx xxx xxx
48. All these provisions which fall under Chapter III of SICA
1985 have to be read conjointly and that too, along with
other relevant provisions and the scheme of SICA 1985.
It is a settled canon of interpretation of statutes that the
statute should not (sic) be construed in its entirety and a
sub-section or a section therein should not be read and
construed in isolation. Chapter III, in fact, is the soul and
essence of SICA 1985 and it provides for the methodology
that is to be adopted for the purposes of detecting, reviving
or even winding up a sick industrial company. Provisions
under SICA 1985 also provide for an appeal against the
orders of BIFR before another specialised body i.e. Aaifr.
To put it simply, this is a self-contained code and because
of the non obstante provisions, contained therein, it has
an overriding effect over the other laws. As per Section
32 of SICA 1985, the Act is required to be enforced with
all its vigour and in precedence to other laws.
xxx xxx xxx
54. Firstly, the facts of these cases are different and distinct
and, therefore, conclusions of the Court have to be read
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 363
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
with reference to the facts of the respective cases only
and not dehors thereof. Once the dictum of this Court is
read with reference to the facts of the respective cases,
it would be evident that there is no conflict of views within
the ambit of ratio decidendi of the respective judgments to
make both of them legal and binding precedents.
55. Despite these judgments and with an intention to
clarify the law, we would state that the matters which are
connected with the sanctioning and implementation of the
scheme right from the date on which it is presented or the
date from which the scheme is made effective, whichever
is earlier, would be the matters which squarely fall within
the ambit and scope of Section 22 of SICA 1985 subject to
their satisfying the ingredients stated under that provision.
This would include the proceedings before the civil court,
Revenue Authorities and/or any other competent forum
in the form of execution or distress in relation to recovery
of amount by sale or otherwise of the assets of the sick
industrial company. It is difficult for us to hold that merely
because a demand by a creditor had not been made a
part of the scheme, pre- or post-sanctioning of the same
for that reason alone, it would fall outside the ambit of
protection of Section 22 of SICA 1985.
xxx xxx xxx
58. Section 22 is the reservoir of the statutory powers
empowering BIFR to determine a scheme, right from its
presentation till its complete implementation in accordance
with law, free of interjections and interference from other
judicial processes. Section 22(1) deals with the execution,
distress or the like proceedings against the company’s
properties, including appointment of a Receiver. It also
specifically provides that even a winding-up petition would
not be instituted and no other proceedings shall lie or
proceed further, except with the consent of BIFR.
xxx xxx xxx
61. It can safely be perceived that the provisions of Section
22 of SICA 1985 are self-explanatory. They would cease
364 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to operate within their own limitations and not by force of
any other law, agreement, memorandum or even articles of
association of the company. The purpose is so very clear
that during the examination, finalisation and implementation
of the scheme, there should be no impediment caused to
the smooth execution of the scheme of revival of the sick
industrial company. It is only when the specified period
of restrictions and declarations contemplated under the
provisions of SICA 1985 is over, that the status quo ante
as it existed at the time of the consideration and finalisation
of the scheme, would become operative. This is done
primarily with the object that the assets of the company
are not diverted, wasted, taken away and/or disposed of
in any manner, during the relevant period.
xxx xxx xxx
69. Sections 22, 22-A, 26 and 32 have to be read and
construed conjointly. A common thread of legislative intent
to treat this law as a special law, in contradistinction to
the other laws except the laws stated in the provisions
and to ensure its effective implementation with utmost
expeditiousness, runs through all these provisions. It also
mandates that no injunction shall be granted by any court
or authority in respect of an action taken or to be taken in
pursuance of the powers conferred to or by under this Act.
xxx xxx xxx
78. The expression “no proceedings” that finds place in
Section 22(1) is of wide spectrum but is certainly not free
of exceptions. The framers of law have given a definite
meaning to the expression “proceedings” appearing under
Section 22(1) of SICA 1985. These proceedings are for
winding up of the industrial company or for execution,
distress or the like against any of the properties of the
industrial company or for the appointment of a Receiver
in respect thereof.
79. The expression “the like” has to be read ejusdem
generis to the term “proceedings”. The words “execution,
distress or the like” have a definite connotation. These
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 365
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
proceedings can have the effect of nullifying or obstructing
the sanctioning or implementation of the revival scheme,
as contemplated under the provisions of SICA 1985. This is
what is required to be avoided for effective implementation
of the scheme. The other facet of the same section is
that, no suit for recovery of money, or for enforcement
of any security against the industrial company, or any
guarantee in respect of any loan or advance granted to
the industrial company shall lie, or be proceeded with
further without the consent of BIFR. In other words, a suit
for recovery and/or for the stated kind of reliefs cannot lie
or be proceeded with further without the leave of BIFR.
Again, the intention is to protect the properties/assets of
the sick industrial company, which is the subject-matter
of the scheme.
80. It is difficult to state with precision the principle that
would uniformly apply to all the proceedings/suits falling
under Section 22(1) of SICA 1985. Firstly, it will depend
upon the facts and circumstances of a given case, it must
satisfy the ingredients of Section 22(1) and fall under any
of the various classes of proceedings stated thereunder.
Secondly, these proceedings should have the impact of
interfering with the formulation, consideration, finalisation
or implementation of the scheme.”
(Emphasis supplied)
83. While the decisions in each of the aforesaid cases should be seen
in the context of the specific factual situation therein, there is a
common thread that binds them all together. All of the aforesaid
decisions proceed on the footing that any proceeding which can
possibly interfere with the formulation, consideration, finalisation
or implementation of a rehabilitation scheme as envisaged under
Chapter III of the Act, has to be suspended under Section 22(1) of
the 1985 Act.
84. It is the above purpose which the scheme of Section 22(1) seeks to
achieve by suspending the proceedings of the nature either mentioned
specifically in the provision, or the proceedings of a like nature.
Although this Court has interpreted the provision liberally by widening
the ambit of its protective umbrella, yet it has also been mindful to
366 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
extend such protection only to such cases where the refusal to allow
such extension would result in miscarriage of the very purpose of
the Act, which is the expeditious revival of sick companies.
85. The ameliorative object of the 1985 Act, as envisaged by the
legislature, is sought to be achieved, inter alia, by the smooth
formulation and implementation of a rehabilitation scheme. Thus, if
any impediment exists to the successful execution of the scheme,
such an impediment is curtailed at the outset by the embargo provided
under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
86. It can be said without a cavil of doubt that the proceedings in the
nature of execution or distress by way of appointment of receiver or
attachment of immovable property, bank accounts, etc. would affect
the assets of a sick company and may inevitably come in the way of
the preparation or execution of the rehabilitation scheme. However, to
hold that the protective shield of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would
apply even to those proceedings which do not have any impact on
the prospects of successful formulation and implementation of the
scheme, and the possibility of revival of the sick company, would run
contrary to the object of the Act, which was never to confer absolute
immunity or impunity on the sick company.
87. Thus, as explained in paragraph 67 of this judgment, a perusal
of the plain text of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act brings out only
two conditions for the suspension of legal proceedings to operate.
However, various decisions of this Court, by necessary implication,
have read into the said provision a third condition which too has to
be fulfilled before a sick company can seek protection of the said
provision. This third condition is that for a legal proceeding to be
suspended under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, it should be shown
to be interfering with the formulation, consideration, finalisation or
implementation of a rehabilitation scheme.
88. A Single Judge of the Delhi High Court has explained very succinctly
these conditions in Goyal MG Gases Pvt. Ltd. v. SBQ Steels Ltd.
reported in 2016 SCC OnLine Del 5100 thus:
“25. The applicability of embargo contained in Section 22(1)
of SICA requires the cumulative and conjoint satisfaction
of two conditions; namely; a) the proceeding sought to
be suspended should clearly satisfy the ingredients of
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 367
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
Section 22(1) and fall within one or more of the categories
of proceedings indicated in the said provision and b)
additionally, the continuance of the proceeding should
have the impact of interfering with the formulation of the
scheme.
26. The Supreme Court has also made it clear that the
applicability of the embargo contained in Section 22(1)
of SICA depends on the facts and circumstances of each
individual case; and no principle of universal application
can be laid down in all such matters.
27. The use of the expressions “Firstly” and “Secondly”,
in para 80 of Raheja Universal Ltd. (supra) would make it
clear that both the conditions given in the judgment have
to be satisfied cumulatively. Even if the suit/proceeding
is of the category contemplated in Section 22(1), that by
itself will not attract the bar contained in the said provision,
unless it additionally has the impact of “interfering with the
formulation, consideration, finalisation or implementation
of the scheme.”
(Emphasis supplied)
89. A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Saketh India (supra)
considered the scope of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act in the context
of the object sought to be achieved by it and held that the term ‘suit
for recovery’ as it appears in the said provision must be construed
ejusdem generis, meaning thereby that only such a suit for recovery
which is in the nature of execution or any other coercive enforcement
will be suspended by the effect of the provision. The relevant parts
of the said decision are extracted hereinbelow:
“5. We think it appropriate, however, to consider the
provision of SICA and analyse what it endeavours to
achieve. We must immediately take note of the fact that
SICA has been repealed by Sick Industrial Companies
(Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003. While it is yet to be
notified, it is significant that provisions akin to Section 22 are
conspicuous by their absence in the new Scheme of revival
of sick companies inserted in form of Part VIA, namely,
“Revival and Rehabilitation of Sick Industrial Companies”.
368 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Obviously, empirical analysis discloses that more often
than not companies which have sought shelter of SICA
have done so to procrastinate, delay and defer clearing
its liability, with the obvious intention of coercing creditors
into unfair settlements rather than implementing projected
schemes supposed to assist in their reconstruction. When
the statute is notified, amendments to the Companies Act,
1956 will become effective and all proceedings pending
before BIFR will stand abated. To some extent, therefore,
the present controversy has been rendered academic.
6. Courts, however, have always been alive to the possible
mischief that invocation of SICA can lead to. In a nutshell,
where the not worth of a company is reduced to a negative,
and the amelioration that is sought is for reviving the
company rather than winding it up, the recourse to the
Act would be legitimate. There is no justifiable reason,
therefore, for all legal proceedings to be immediately even
held in abeyance, if not dismissed. We are mindful of the
fact that Parliament has incorporated an amendment in
the Section with effect from 1.2.1994 in these words —
“no suit for the recovery of money or for the enforcement
of any security against the industrial company or of any
guarantee in respect of any loans or advance granted to
the industrial company — shall lie or be proceeded with-
further, except with the consent of the Board, or as the case
may be, the Appellate Authority”. It appears to us that the
phrase “recovery of money” must be construed ejusdem
generis and accordingly recovery proceedings in the nature
of execution or any other coercive enforcement that has
been ordained to be not maintainable. We do not find any
logic in holding legal proceedings to be not maintainable,
or to be liable to be halted unless, even if the debt sought
to be proved in the Plaint has not been admitted. Given the
delays presently endemic in the justice delivery system if a
creditor is disallowed even from proving the indebtedness
of a recalcitrant debtor SICA company, it would cause
unjustified hardship. Whichever way we look at the matter,
there can be no logic in denying legal recourse to a party
for proving its debt. In the event that at least the principal
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 369
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
amount, or a substantial part of it stands admitted, either
in the suit or by means of a mention in the Scheme placed
before the BIFR, the aggrieved party must be permitted
to prove its claim. In holding so, the only prejudice that
we can conceive of is incurring expenditure in legal fees.
When this is weighed against the interests of a person
claiming that the company is indebted to it, the balance
tilts in favour of the latter. A holistic reading of Section
22(1) of SICA makes it manifestly clear that Parliament’s
intention was to insulate sick companies only against
proceedings for winding-up or for execution, or distress or
the like or for enforcement of any security or guarantee.
In the case in hand, despite several opportunities granted
to the Appellant, it has miserably and perhaps deliberately
failed to substantiate that the claim mentioned in the Suit
has been reflected in the Scheme placed before the BIFR
but even more poignantly, that a scheme was, in fact,
pending before BIFR. If an Appeal is pending, has BIFR
failed to grant or has withdrawn registration under SICA.
We see the conduct of the Appellant as nothing more than
an abuse of SICA.
7. The Apex Court has in Deputy Commercial Tax Officer
v. Corromandal Pharmaceuticals, (1997) 10 SCC 649
enunciated the law in the context of SICA to be that a
cessation of legal proceedings would be justified only if
the dues in respect of which adjudication is ongoing is
also included in or within the contemplation of the Scheme
presented to BIFR. Their Lordships had analysed and
distinguished its previous decisions in Gram Panchayat
v. Shree Vallabh Glass Works Limited, (1990) 2 SCC 440
as well as Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. v. State of Industrial
and Investment Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd., (1993) 2
SCC 144 on the reasoning that in those cases the liability
of the sick company had arisen for the first time after the
sanction of the Scheme by BIFR….
8. In Sirmor Sudburg Auto Ltd. v. Kuldip Singh Lamba,
[1998] 91 Comp. Cas. 727, R.C. Lahoti, J., as the Learned
Single Judge of this Court then was, opined that to be
entitled to a stay of legal proceedings under Section 22
370 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of the Act, a mere pendency of the enquiry would not
suffice; the claimed dues must be reckoned or included
in the sanctioned scheme. A suit for eviction against a
sick industrial company is not liable to be stayed under
Section 22(1) of the SICA. This decision has been followed
by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Taulis
Pharma Ltd. v. Bengal Immunity Ltd., [2002] 108 Comp.
Cas. 237. Similar views have also been expressed in
Vibgyar Ink Chem (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Safe Pack Polymers Ltd.,
[1998] 93 Com. Cas. 407, which likewise is a decision
of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court
which enunciates that “an independent transaction de hors
the scheme obviously cannot thus be covered within the
ambit of Section 22 of the 1985 Act”.
9. Justice Lahoti’s view has also been followed by a Single
Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Fort William Industries
Limited v. Usha Bentron Limited, [2002] 108 Comp. Cas.
176. His Lordship, Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J. has, in
the Cement Corporation of India v. Manohar Basin, 82
(1999) DLT 343 : 1999 (51) DRJ 535 observed that since
no documentary proof had been furnished to disclose that
any scheme stood sanctioned the so-called SICA bar was
not attracted. A Single Bench of the Bombay High Court
in Special Steels v. Jay Prestressed Products Ltd., [1991]
72 Comp. Cas. 277 has opined that the pivotal question
in connection with the current conundrum concerns the
assets of the Company and its functioning, and these
would not be jeopardized if a civil suit continues. In Hardip
Singh v. Income Tax Officer, Amritsar, [1979] 118 ITR 57
(SC) the winding-up petition was allowed to continue and
only when the third and final stage of the dissolution of
the Company came to be reached, was the moratorium
of Section 22 of the SICA enforced.”

90. The original plaintiff has placed strong reliance upon the decision of
a single judge of the Delhi High Court in Sunil Mittal (supra). It was
held therein that since the liability was neither admitted nor taken
into consideration by any rehabilitation scheme, the suit proceedings
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 371
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
could not have been adjourned sine die under Section 22(1) of the
1985 Act. The relevant paragraphs are extracted hereinbelow:
“21. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the
case, I feel as the FChas not admitted its liability to pay the
amount to the tune as claimed by the plaintiff nor such an
amount has been reckoned or taken into consideration by
any scheme of rehabilitation of the sick defendant company,
therefore, the proceedings of the present suit cannot be
adjourned sine die. As a matter of fact the defendant has
not placed on record any documentary evidence to show
that any such scheme has been formulated as yet and if
formulated whether the said amount has been taken care
of allegedly being owed to the Plaintiff.
22. For the aforesaid reasons, I feel that the application
of the Defendant totally misconceived and accordingly,
the same is dismissed.”
(Emphasis supplied)
91. It has come to our notice that the said decision in Sunil Mittal
(supra) was challenged in appeal before a division bench of the
Delhi High Court in LML Ltd. v. Sunil Mittal reported in 2013 SCC
OnLine Del 1766 wherein the bench set aside the decision and held
that Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would apply to the facts of the
case. The bench observed that from the record it was clear that the
amount as claimed by the plaintiff in the recovery suit was admittedly
covered by the scheme and thus the proceeding was liable to be
suspended by application of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. Thus,
the position of law held in Sunil Mittal (supra), could not be said to
have been disturbed, but only its incorrect application to the facts
of the specific case was set aside in LML Ltd. (supra).
92. The decision in LML Ltd. (supra), on the contrary, fortifies the
interpretation of Section 22(1) as was done in Sunil Mittal (supra)
and Saketh India (supra). The relevant paragraph of the decision
in LML Ltd. (supra) is extracted hereinbelow:
“16. The principle of law is thus unambiguous. Where
the amount claimed or the liability sought to be set up is
covered under the scheme, Section 22(1) will be attracted
and there would be an automatic suspension of all legal
372 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
proceedings including a suit for recovery of money. In the
present case, the amount Rs. 21,74,490.88 is admittedly
a part of the DRS pending before the BIFR. The debt of
Rs. 3,00,000/- on account of sales tax dues, the petitioner
admits as his liability. Even if this amount is not permitted
to be adjusted at this stage as has been pointed out by
the learned counsel for the respondent, keeping in view
the wide import of the language of Section 22 of the said
Act there can be no question of continuing with the suit
proceedings. It also cannot be lost sight of the fact that
the parties were maintaining a running account; payments
were being made from time to time; it would thus not
be possible to segregate the element of debt since the
question would be whether the debt due to the plaintiff
is correctly reflected or a lesser amount is in fact due
to him. The language of Section 22 would take into its
sweep a situation even where if the full amount is not a
part of the DRS. The question of continuation of the suit
would not arise.”
(Emphasis supplied)
93. In M/s Haryana Steel & Alloys Ltd. v. M/s Transport Corporation
of India reported in (2012) SCC OnLine Del 2140 it was held that
the mere contention of the sick company unsubstantiated by any
material indicating that the amount forming subject-matter of the
recovery suit is covered under the scheme, would not be sufficient to
bring the company under the protective ambit of Section 22(1) of the
Act. The relevant paragraphs of the said decision are extracted thus:
“11. However, there is another dimension to the said
embargo placed on filing of the suit for recovery against
a company when the proceedings are pending under the
SICA, which is the necessity of the inclusion of the dues
payable by the company to the plaintiff in the scheme
formulated before the BIFR. It is a settled legal position
that it is not by mere pendency of an enquiry under Section
16 of the said Act or preparation of the scheme thereof
being under consideration or even filing of an appeal under
section 25 before the appellate authority that by itself would
entitle the appellant for the said statutory injunction against
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 373
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
the respondent/plaintiff as the benefit of the prohibition
or embargo created under section 22 of the Act would
come into operation only where the appellant/defendant
has disclosed before the Court, that the amounts claimed
by the respondent/plaintiff have been duly shown and
disclosed in the scheme formulated and laid before the
BIFR. The Apex Court in the case of Deputy Commercial
Tax Officer v. Corromandal Pharmaceuticals, (1997) 10
SCC 649 enunciated the law to hold that a cessation of
legal proceedings would be justified only if the dues in
respect of which adjudication is ongoing is also included
in the contemplation of scheme presented by BIFR…
xxx xxx xxx
14. In the light of the above settled legal position, analyzing
the facts of the case at hand, it is manifest that no material
was placed on record by the appellant to show that the
amount in respect of which the respondent laid its claim
in the said recovery suit was reflected in the scheme
laid before the BIFR. The only contention raised by the
appellant before the trial court as well as before this
Court was that the prohibition or embargo as envisaged
in Section 22 would come into operation immediately
once the defendant brings to the notice of the Court that
an inquiry under Section 16 is pending before the Board
or an appeal is pending relating to the said inquiry before
the Appellate Authority. Having failed to place any such
material on record, this Court is of the clear view that the
bar or embargo envisaged under Section 22 of the Act will
not apply to the facts of the present case as the appellant
cannot take the advantage of the said provision merely
because an inquiry under Section 16 was pending before
the BIFR or an Appeal under Section 25 against the order
of BIFR was pending before the AAIFR.”

94. In Kusum Products Ltd. v. Hitkari Industries Ltd. reported in
2014 SCC OnLine Del 4926, a learned Single Judge of the Delhi
High Court, relying upon the decision in Raheja Universal (supra)
held that a suit for recovery of money simpliciter will not be liable
374 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to be suspended under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. It was
observed thus:
“3. The aforesaid paragraphs show that the proceedings
for which prior permission is required under Section 22 of
SICA are proceedings in the nature of execution, distress
or like. It is not every suit or every suit for recovery which
automatically becomes proceedings in the nature of
execution, distress or like, and only such suits of recovery
where there would be proceedings which cause liquidation
of assets of a sick company, would be those suits which
would be hit by the bar of Section 22 of SICA.
4. In the present case, the suit for recovery of money is
a suit for recovery of money simplicitor. Counsel for the
plaintiff does not press the interim applications under Order
38 Rule 5 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) and
Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC. Accordingly, in the subject
suit, there is no threat to the liquidation of the assets of
the sick company and therefore no prior permission is
required under Section 22 of SICA.”
(Emphasis supplied)
95. In FMI Investment Pvt. Ltd. v. Montari Industries Ltd. and Another
reported in (2012) SCC OnLine Del 5354, the High Court undertook
a comprehensive analysis of the dictum as laid in Raheja Universal
(supra) and Saketh India (supra) and held thus:
“6. The salient conclusions which can be arrived at from
reading of the aforesaid paras in the case of Raheja
Universal (supra) are : -
(i) The proceedings which are affected by Section 22(1) are
proceedings in the nature of execution, distress or the like.
(ii) It depends on facts of each case as to whether the
suit is hit by Section 22 i.e. all suits including of recovery,
are not hit by Section 22(1).
(iii) Only those suits which have the effect of execution,
distress or like action against the properties of the sick
company are hit by Section 22 i.e. where a suit is simply
for recovery of moneys, and the properties of a sick
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 375
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
company are not threatened by the proceedings including
interim proceedings such as appointment of receiver,
execution, distress or the like, such suits can continue
without permission under Section 22.
7. Learned counsel for the defendant no. 2 sought to place
reliance on the following three judgments to argue that
permission under Section 22 is a sine qua non.
(i) Managing Director, Bhoruka Textiles Ltd. v. Kashmiri
Rice Industries (2009) 7 SCC 521;
(ii) Tata Davy Ltd. v. State of Orissa (1997) 6 SCC 669;
(iii) Dr. B.K. Modi v. Morgan Securities and Credits Pvt.
Ltd. and Morgan Securities and Credits Pvt. Ltd. v.
Dr. B.K. Modi MANU/DE/2779/2012
8. In my opinion, all the three judgments, which have been
cited on behalf of defendant no. 2 have no application
because the legal position is sufficiently elaborated by
the Supreme Court in the judgment of Raheja Universal
(supra).
9. None of the aforesaid judgments cited on behalf of
defendant no. 2 deal with the issue of interpretation of
Section 22 of SICA as has been done by the Division Bench
of three Judges in the case of Raheja Universal (supra)
and which holds that unless the suit proceedings are in
the nature of ‘execution, distress or the like’, the suit can
continue. The judgments relied upon by the defendant no.
2 are judgments which simply hold that once a company
is a sick company, permission is required under Section
22 of the SICA, however, none of the judgments cited on
behalf of the defendant no. 2 deal with the proposition as
incorporated in the later judgment of the Division Bench of
three Judges of the Supreme Court in the case of Raheja
Universal (supra). Accordingly, it is held that the suit is
maintainable.
10. In the present suit for recovery it cannot be said that
the suit is of a nature which has impact of or threat to
the properties of the defendant No. 1 sick company to
affect the scheme of revival. The suit is a simple suit for
376 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
recovery under Order 37 CPC not having proceedings,
whether interim or final, of execution, distress or the
like and hence the suit is not hit by Section 22 of SICA.
So far as defendant No. 2/guarantor is concerned, the
suit against him will not surely hit any assets of the sick
company and hence is not barred under Section 22 of
SICA.”
(Emphasis supplied)
96. In one recent decision of the Delhi High Court in Chhattisgarh
Distilleries Ltd. v. Percept Advertising Limited reported in 2023
SCC OnLine Del 6417, while considering the question on applicability
of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, it was held thus:
“8. It is well settled that there was legal duty cast upon the
appellant/defendant to bring it to the notice of the Court that
it had qualified for the protection under the SICA, and this
obligation was not discharged. There is no gainsaying that
the aforesaid provision has been interpreted in umpteen
number of cases decided by the Apex Court as well as this
Court. In the cited case of Saketh India Limited (supra), it
was observed that the phrase “recovery of money” must
be construed ejusdem generis and accordingly recovery
proceedings in the nature of execution or any other coercive
enforcement that has been ordained to be not maintainable.
There is nothing in the said provision so as to hold the
legal proceedings to be not maintainable, or liable to be
halted, even if the debt sought to be proved in the plaint
has not been admitted. Furthermore, it was observed that
there can be no logic in denying legal recourse to a party
for proving its debt. The said decision was relied upon by
this Court again in the decision of Ralson Industries Ltd.
(now known as Da Rubber Industries Ltd) (supra), wherein
it was categorically held that the proceedings that can be
halted by invoking Section 22 of the SICA should be in
the nature of execution, distress or the like.”
(Emphasis supplied)
97. From the aforesaid discussion, the position of law on the first issue
before us appears to be that for the applicability of Section 22(1) of
the 1985 Act, three aspects need to be considered –
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 377
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
I. First, an inquiry under Section 16 of the 1985 Act must be
pending; or any scheme referred to in Section 17 of the 1985
Act must be under preparation or consideration or a sanctioned
scheme must be under implementation; or an appeal under
Section 25 of the 1985 Act must be pending – in relation the
company against whom the legal proceedings sought to be
suspended have been initiated.
II. Secondly, the proceedings must be one from amongst the six
types as described in paragraph 65 of this judgment, or of a
similar nature, i.e. ejusdem generis to the said six types of
proceedings.
III. Thirdly, the proceedings must have the effect of threatening the
assets of the sick company and interfering with the formulation,
consideration, finalisation or implementation of the scheme.
98. Applying the aforesaid tests to the facts of the present case, we have
already observed that requirement (i) is fulfilled. The proceeding in
question being a suit for recovery of money, requirement (ii) is also
satisfied. However, we are of the considered opinion that the third
requirement is not fulfilled. We say so because the suit for recovery
was not of a nature which could have proved to be a threat to the
properties of the defendant sick company or would have adversely
impacted the scheme of revival. The suit was a simple suit for recovery
of money towards the dues arising under the alleged illegal deductions
under the contract. This cannot be said to be a proceeding in the
nature of execution, distress or the like and hence the suit was not
hit by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
99. By no stretch of imagination could it be said that the legislature
intended to include even the proceedings for the adjudication of the
liabilities not admitted by a sick company within the protective ambit
of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. Such an adjudicatory process only
determines the liability of the defendant towards the plaintiff, and
does not threaten the assets of the sick company or interfere with
the formulation of the scheme unless execution proceedings are
initiated pursuant to the completion of such adjudicatory process. In
the case of Jay Engineering (supra), it was rightly observed by this
Court in the context of arbitration proceedings under the 1993 Act
for the adjudication of claims, that while the execution of an award
would definitely be suspended under Section 22(1) of the 1985
378 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Act, the adjudicatory process for arriving at such an award cannot
be said to be suspended by the said provision. This position also
seems to be justified in light of the fact that the proceedings before
the BIFR under the 1985 Act were generally long-drawn and time
consuming and it would subserve the interest of justice if a party was
prevented even from proving the debt/liability of the sick company
for the entirety of that lengthy period.
100. We may also look at Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act by applying
the mischief rule of interpretation. G.P. Singh in his authoritative
commentary on the interpretation of statutes describes the mischief
rule of construction as follows:
“The rule which is also known as ‘purposive construction’
or ‘mischief rule’, enables consideration of four matters
in construing an Act: (i) What was the law before the
making of the Act, (ii) What was the mischief or defect for
which the law did not provide, (iii) What is the remedy that
the Act has provided, and (iv) What is the reason of the
remedy. The rule then directs that the courts must adopt
that construction which “shall suppress the mischief and
advance the remedy.””
101. Applying the aforesaid rule to Section 22(1) of the Act, we find that
there was a vacuum in the legal framework to deal with sick industrial
companies and provide ameliorative steps for their revival. The 1985
Act was thus enacted to fill in this vacuum. The mischief which was
sought to be dealt with by the enactment of Section 22 was any such
legal proceeding which could impact the assets of the sick company
and in-turn negatively impact the formulation and implementation
of the rehabilitative scheme. This provision was inserted to provide
a remedy by ensuring that the multiple recourses available under
the law for recovery of debts, etc. were suspended for the period
during which the sick company was under the ameliorative shelter
of the BIFR. Finally, it can be said that the reason for the remedy
was to shield the formulation and implementation of the revival
scheme from any impediments thereby maximising the chances of
revival of sick company, which was the ultimate object sought to be
achieved by the Act.
102. The original defendants have placed strong reliance on 3 decisions of
this Court in Jay Engineering (supra), Bhoruka Textiles (supra) and
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 379
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
Tata Motors (supra) respectively. We have discussed in the foregoing
parts of this judgment as to how this Court in Jay Engineering
(supra) expressly observed that it was not the adjudicatory process,
but the execution of an award which would be restricted by Section
22(1) of the 1985 Act. This judgment, thus, only furthers the line of
reasoning we have adopted to negate the contention of the original
defendants on the applicability of Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
103. The decision in Bhoruka Textiles (supra) dealt with the specific facts
in that case and should be read alongwith the decision in Raheja
Universal (supra) wherein the scope of Section 22(1) of the 1985
Act was considered in detail by a three-Judge bench. We would also
like to observe that the reliance placed by this Court in Bhoruka
Textiles (supra) on the decision in Tata Motors (supra) seems to
be misplaced. The relevant paragraph of Bhoruka Textiles (supra)
is reproduced hereinbelow:
“10. Section 22 of the Act must be interpreted giving a plain
meaning to its contents. An enquiry in terms of Section
16 of the Act by the Board is permissible upon receipt of
a reference. Thus, reference having been made on 27-
12-2001 and the suit having been filed on 17-12-2002,
the receipt of a reference must be held to be the starting
period for proceeding with the enquiry.
11. The effect of the provisions of the Act has been
considered by a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court
in Tata Motors Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Products of India
Ltd. [(2008) 7 SCC 619] wherein it, in no uncertain terms,
held that SICA is a special statute and, thus, overrides
other Acts like the Companies Act, 1956, stating: (SCC
p. 635, paras 31-33)
“31. SICA furthermore was enacted to secure the
principles specified in Article 39 of the Constitution
of India. It seeks to give effect to the larger public
interest. It should be given primacy because of its
higher public purpose. Section 26 of SICA bars the
jurisdiction of the civil courts.
32. What scheme should be prepared by the operating
agency for revival and rehabilitation of the sick
380 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
industrial company is within the domain of BIFR.
Section 26 not only covers orders passed under
SICA but also any matter which BIFR is empowered
to determine.
33. The jurisdiction of the civil court is, thus, barred in
respect of any matter for which the Appellate Authority
or the Board is empowered. The High Court may not
be a civil court but its jurisdiction in a case of this
nature is limited.”
12. If the civil court’s jurisdiction was ousted in terms of the
provisions of Section 22 of the Act, any judgment rendered
by it would be coram non judice. It is a well-settled principle
of law that a judgment and decree passed by a court or
tribunal lacking inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity. In
Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan [AIR 1954 SC 340] this
Court held: (AIR p. 342, para 6)
“6. … It is a fundamental principle well established
that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction
is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up
whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced
or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and
even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction,
whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is
in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes
at the very authority of the court to pass any decree,
and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent
of parties.”
(See also Chief Engineer, Hydel Project v. Ravinder
Nath [(2008) 2 SCC 350 : (2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 940],
SCC p. 361, para 26.)”
104. A perusal of the above indicates that in Tata Motors (supra), it
was Section 26 and not Section 22 of the 1985 Act which was
under consideration. As opposed to Section 26 of the Act, which
bars the jurisdiction of the civil courts in respect of those matters
for which the BIFR or the AAIFR are empowered, Section 22 only
places a temporary embargo on the initiation or continuation of legal
proceedings in respect of certain matters mentioned therein. Further,
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 381
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
unlike Section 22, where the said suspension can be revoked by
seeking express permission of the BIFR or the AAIFR, no such
permission can be sought under Section 26 of the 1985 Act. Again,
in any view of the matter, the adjudication and determination of a
contested liability under a contract is undoubtedly the domain of the
civil court or an arbitral tribunal and not that of the BIFR or the AAIFR.
v. ISSUE NO. 2: Whether the High Court was correct in granting
24% Compound Interest on the Principal Decretal Amount
in favour of the original Plaintiff?
105. The High Court in its impugned judgment considered, as a separate
issue, whether the original plaintiff was entitled to claim 24%
compound interest from the original defendants on the delayed
payments.
a. Concept of Interest
106. When interest is awarded by the Court, our normal feeling is that it
is so awarded by way of penalty or punishment. But interest in all
cases is not granted by way of penalty or punishment. In this regard,
reference may be made to the decision of this Court in the case of
Alok Shanker Pandey v. Union of India, reported in 2007 AIR (SC)
1198, wherein the concept of grant of interest has been explained
in the following manner:
“It may be mentioned that there is misconception about
interest. Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but
it is the normal accretion on capital. For example, if A
had to pay B a certain amount, say ten years ago, but he
offers that amount to him today, then he has pocketed the
interest on the principal amount. Had A paid that amount
to B ten years ago, B would have invested that amount
somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that
A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on
it for this period. Hence equity demands that A should not
only pay back the principal but also interest thereon to B.”
107. The above-noted decision of this Court makes it clear that interest
on the delayed payment of the claim amount accrues due to the
continuing wrong committed by the wilful withholding of the payment
towards the claim, resulting in a continuous injury until such payment
is made, or in other words, until the claim is realised.
382 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
108. The High Court relied upon the provisions of the 1993 Act to hold
that as per Sections 4 and 5 respectively of the said legislation,
the original plaintiff, which was a small-scale industrial undertaking,
was entitled to claim compound interest @ 24% per annum from
the original defendants. As a result, the High Court set aside the
decree of the trial court which granted 12% simple interest in favour
the original plaintiff.
109. The original defendants are aggrieved by the awarding of 24% interest
in favour of the original plaintiff, which they contend has resulted in
the principal decretal amount getting inflated exorbitantly. The original
plaintiff, on the other hand, has argued that the impugned judgment
of the High Court insofar as it deals with the issue of interest cannot
be said to suffer from any infirmity and was arrived at after due
consideration of relevant material viz. the Handbook of Statistics of
Indian Economy published by the Reserve Bank of India, etc. and
after hearing the parties at length.
110. The original plaintiff has further submitted that the High Court
considered the floor rate charged by the SBI for the financial year
1993-1994, which was 19%, as observed under the Table 74 on
Structure of Interest Rates in the Handbook of Statistics of Indian
Economy published by the Reserve Bank of India.
111. We shall briefly consider the object and scope of the 1993 Act for a
better understanding of the issue before us. The Interest on Delayed
Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings
Ordinance, 1992 was promulgated by the President of India on
23.09.1992. To replace this ordinance, the 1993 Act was enacted
on 02.04.1993 and came into force with retrospective effect from
23.09.1992. Subsequently, the 1993 Act was repealed by the Micro
Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (“MSMED
Act, 2006”). The statement of objects and reasons to the 1993 Act
reads as under:
“A policy statement on small scale industries was made by
the Government in Parliament. It was stated at that time
that suitable legislation would be brought to ensure prompt
payment of money by buyers to the small industrial units.
2. Inadequate working capital in a small scale or
an ancillary industrial undertaking causes serious
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 383
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
and endemic problems affecting the health of such
undertaking. Industries in this sector have also been
demanding that adequate measures be taken in this
regard. The Small Scale Industries Board, which is an
apex advisory body on policies relating to small scale
industrial units with representatives from all the States,
governmental bodies and the industrial sector, also
expressed this view. It was, therefore, felt that prompt
payments of money by buyers should be statutorily
ensured and mandatory provisions for payment of interest
on the outstanding money, in case of default, should be
made. The buyers, if required under law to pay interest,
would refrain from withholding payments to small scale
and ancillary industrial undertakings.
3. An Ordinance, namely, the Interest on Delayed Payments
to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings
Ordinance, 1992, was, therefore, promulgated by the
President on the 23rd September, 1992.
4. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance and to
achieve the aforesaid objects.”
112. It is evident from the aforesaid statement of objects and reasons that
the legislature desired to bring about a legislation which would ensure
prompt payment of money to small scale units, as the absence of
working capital may have severe impacts on the functioning of small
scale and ancillary industries. The 1993 Act envisaged that there
should be minimal delay in payments to small scale units. Section 2
of the 1993 Act provides for the certain important definitions which
are reproduced hereinbelow:
“(b) “appointed day” means the day following immediately
after the expiry of the period of thirty days from the date
of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance of any
goods or any services by a buyer from a supplier;
Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause,—
(i)“the day of acceptance” means,—
(a) the day of the actual delivery of goods or the
rendering of services; or
384 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(b) where any objection is made in writing by the
buyer regarding acceptance of goods or services
within thirty days from the day of the delivery of
goods or the rendering of services, the day on
which such objection is removed by the supplier;
(ii) “the day of deemed acceptance” means, where no
objection is made in writing by the buyer regarding
acceptance of goods or services within thirty days from the
day of the delivery of goods or the rendering of services,
the day of the actual delivery of goods or the rendering
of services;
(c) “buyer” means whoever buys any goods or receives
any services from a supplier for consideration;
xxx xxx xxx
(f) “supplier” means an ancillary industrial undertaking or
a small scale industrial undertaking holding a permanent
registration certificate issued by the Directorate of Industries
of a State or Union territory and includes,—
(i) the National Small Industries Corporation, being a
company, registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1
of 1956);
(ii) the Small Industries Development Corporation of a
State or a Union territory, by whatever name called, being
a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1
of 1956).]”
113. Section 3 of the 1993 Act provides for the liability of the buyer to
make payment to the small-scale industries whereas Section 4 and
5 respectively of the said Act pertain to the date from which and
the rate at which interest is payable. Section 5 of the 1993 Act also
stipulates that the buyer shall be liable to pay compound interest.
Sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively of the 1993 Act, as existing at the
time when the dispute between the parties arose, are reproduced
thus: -
“3. Liability of buyer to make payment - Where any
supplier supplies any goods or renders any services to
any buyer, the buyer shall make payment therefor on or
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 385
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
before the date agreed upon between him and the supplier
in writing or, where there is no agreement in this behalf,
before the appointed day.
4. Date from which and rate at which interest is
payable - Where any buyer fails to make payment of the
amount to the supplier, as required under section 3, the
buyer shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any
agreement between the buyer and the supplier or in any
law for the time being in force, be liable to pay interest to
the supplier on that amount from the appointed day or,
as the case may be, from the date immediately following
the date agreed upon, at such rate, which is five per cent
points above the floor rate for comparable lending.
Explanation: For the purposes of this section, “floor rate for
comparable lending” means the highest of the minimum
lending rates charged by scheduled banks (not being co-
operative banks) on credit limits in accordance with the
directions given or issued to banking companies generally
by the Reserve Bank of India under the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949 (10 of 1949).
5. Liability of buyer to pay compound interest -
Notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement
between a supplier and a buyer or in any law for the time
being in force, the buyer shall be liable to pay compound
interest (with monthly interest) at the rate mentioned in
section 4 on the amount due to the supplier.”
114. On a perusal of Section 3 of the 1993 Act, we find that where any
supplier supplies any goods, the buyer shall make payment on or
before the date agreed upon between him and the supplier in writing
or, where there is no agreement in this behalf, before the appointed
day. In the instant case, as per the terms of the NIT, payment was
to be made within 20 days from the receipt of the goods.
115. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, the High
Court has awarded 24% compound interest on the amounts due
to the original plaintiff from the date the amounts were determined
to have become due till the date of their realisation by the original
plaintiff. While there is no doubt that the rate of interest applicable
to the dues of the original plaintiff as determined by the High Court
386 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is correct, we think it is necessary to examine if the compound
interest can be said to have continued to accrue even when FCIL
was declared a sick company and was awaiting its revival before
the BIFR. In other words, it is not the rate of interest but the period
for which it is applicable, is the question that is to be determined.
116. We have discussed at length in the foregoing paragraphs of the
judgment the object behind the enactment of the 1985 Act. Sickness
of industrial companies was considered to be a problem that affected
the country at large, and thus the 1985 Act was enacted as per the
policy directions contained in Article 39 of the Constitution to provide,
inter alia, ameliorative steps for the revival of sick companies, and for
the expeditious detection of potentially sick companies. In particular,
we would like to mention that Section 19 of the 1985 Act provides
that the scheme for rehabilitation of a sick company may provide for
financial assistance to the sick company by way of loans, advances,
reliefs or concessions or sacrifices from the Central Government, a
State Government, a public financial institution etc.
117. In the present case, in pursuance of Section 19 of the Act, a number
of decisions were taken by the CCEA on 09.05.2013 including the
waiver of loans and interest thereon by the Central Government
which ran into thousands of crores. As per the document F.No.
18055/13/2012-FCA-1 titled “Gist of the CCEA decisions dated 09th
May, 2013” published by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers,
it appears that the dues of the major unsecured creditors were
settled at 30% of their dues as on 31.03.2003. Further, the dues of
some other parties were settled without any interest or penalty, as
otherwise the entire process of revival might have gotten derailed.
118. We have also discussed how Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends
any legal proceedings of the nature specified therein if they can
potentially interfere with the consideration, sanction or execution
of the rehabilitation scheme. The intention behind the sanction and
execution of a rehabilitation scheme, without a doubt, is to increase
the chances of the revival of the sick company in public interest.
119. Thus, on one hand we have the beneficial provisions of the 1985
Act, enacted to maximise the chances of revival of sick industrial
companies, while on the other, we have the 1993 Act, which was
enacted with the intention to ensure that small-scale industries are
paid their dues in time. This object of the 1993 Act was sought to be
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 387
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
achieved by providing a high interest rate, with monthly compounding,
so as to act as a deterrent for the buyers.
120. A preliminary contention was raised by the original defendants that
the original plaintiff chose to institute a civil suit for recovery of money,
rather than following the process prescribed under Section 6 of the
1993 Act, which provides for the referring of a dispute arising under
the 1993 Act to arbitration before the Industry Facilitation Council,
and thus for this reason, the suit for recovery, which is expressly
suspended under Section 22(1) of the Act, should be held as not
maintainable. It was also argued that even otherwise no interest
should be granted on the amount claimed as due since the mechanism
prescribed under Section 6(2) of the 1993 Act was not followed.
121. Section 6 of the 1993 Act reads as follows:
“6. Recovery of amount due -
(1) The amount due from a buyer, together with the
amount of interest calculated in accordance with the
provisions of sections 4 and 5, shall be recoverable by
the supplier from the buyer by way of a suit or other
proceeding under any law for the time being in force.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),
any party to a dispute may make a reference to the
Industry Facilitation Council for acting as an arbitrator
or conciliator in respect of the matters referred to in
that sub-section and the provisions of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to
such dispute as if the arbitration or conciliation were
pursuant to an arbitration agreement referred to in
sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act.”
122. We do not find any force in this contention of the original defendants.
Section 6 merely provides that for the purpose of recovery of the
amounts due under the 1993 Act, a supplier may make a reference to
the Industries Facilitation Council, which is established under Section
7A of the 1993 Act. First, at the time of the institution of the suit by
the original plaintiff, the Industries Facilitation Councils didn’t exist
as the provision for their establishment was only brought in vide an
amendment in 1998. Secondly, even otherwise, Section 6(2) of the
1993 Act merely provides for an alternate avenue to the supplier in
388 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
addition to a suit or any other legal proceedings as mentioned in
Section 6(1) of the 1993 Act.
123. It is also pertinent to mention that in the absence of the express
permission of the BIFR, Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends any
legal proceedings in the nature of execution during the pendency of
the scheme before the BIFR, as execution would necessarily result in
negatively impacting the assets of a sick company, thereby affecting
the preparation, sanction or implementation of scheme and as a net
effect, would bring down the chances of revival of the sick company.
124. In the present case, the suit was decreed in favour of the original
plaintiff by the trial court vide its judgment dated 19.09.2001. However,
while the adjudication of the suit of the original plaintiff could not
have been said to be barred under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act as
it was for the mere determination of liability of the parties inter-se,
the execution of decree obtained as a result thereof was expressly
suspended during the period as mentioned in the said provision,
unless the requisite permission from the BIFR or the AAIFR could
be obtained.
125. Interest of justice requires that both the 1985 Act and the 1993
Act, which are in the nature of beneficial enactments, should be
read harmoniously so as to impart a meaningful construction to the
language of each of the enactments. It was held in Jay Engineering
(supra) on the interplay between the two Acts as follows:
“13. The 1993 Act was enacted to provide for and regulate
the payment of interest on delayed payments to small-
scale and ancillary industrial undertakings and for matters
connected therewith.
14. The provisions of the 1993 Act, therefore, do not
envisage a situation where an industrial company becomes
sick and requires framing of a scheme for its revival.”
(Emphasis supplied)
126. In our opinion, it would defy logic to hold that even for the period
when the principal decretal amount awarded by the civil court under
a decree could not have been realised in lieu of the suspension of
execution proceedings, interest would continue to mount on the
principal decretal amount. Thus, while there is a stay on proceedings
in the nature of distress and execution, etc. against the properties of
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 389
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
the sick company, to safeguard its assets, awarding interest for that
very same period, though not expressly barred under any provision
of the Act, could not have been the intention of the legislature.
127. Any other interpretation would only lead to an absurd result that as
soon as a sick company is revived after the steps taken by the BIFR,
and concessions, financial support, etc. provided by the government,
it would be prone to the liability of having to pay exorbitant interest
that would have accrued on any decree which can be put to execution
after the end of BIFR proceedings.
128. The net effect would be that a freshly revived sick company would
potentially be saddled with huge amounts, as has happened in the
present case because of the impugned judgment, and be at a risk
of being rendered sick again, thus defeating the very purpose of
the 1985 Act.
129. A two-judge bench of this Court, in a recent decision in Modi
Rubber Ltd. v. Continental Carbon India Ltd., reported in 2023
SCC OnLine SC 296 decided the issue as to whether it was open
to an unsecured creditor to not accept the scaled down value of its
dues, as computed in the rehabilitation scheme, and wait for the
revival of the sick company to recover its debt with interest post
the rehabilitation. This Court, after an exhaustive consideration of
the object of the 1985 Act, answered the issue in the negative and
held as follows:
“40. The short question, which is posed for the consideration
of this Court is:—
“Whether on approval of a scheme by the BIFR under the
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985,
an unsecured creditor has the option not to accept the
scaled down value of its dues, and to wait till the scheme
for rehabilitation of the respondent - sick company has
worked itself out, with an option to recover the debt with
interest post such rehabilitation?”
xxx xxx xxx
49. Thus, the primary concern of the Board would be the
revival of the sick company and to save the sick company
from winding up. That is why with a view to see that there
390 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
is no impediment in framing the rehabilitation scheme and
to get out the sick company from sickness. Section 22
provides for suspension of legal proceedings, contracts
etc. On a bare reading of Section 22 and Section 22A of
SICA, it appears that these two provisions primarily ensure
that the scheme prepared by BIFR does not get frustrated
because of certain other legal proceedings and to prevent
untimely and unwarranted disposal of the assets of the sick
industrial company. These sections clearly state certain
restrictions which will impact upon the implementation
of the scheme as well as on the assets of the company.
xxx xxx xxx
53. Keeping in mind the statement of objects and reasons
for enactment of SICA, 1985 and the powers exercised
by the BIFR and the primary concern to revive the sick
industry for which the rehabilitation scheme is to be framed
under Section 18, the question posed is required to be
considered.
xxx xxx xxx
56. The operating agency is defined under Section 3(i)
and it means any public financial institution, State-level
institution, scheduled bank or any other person as may
be specified by general or special order as its agency
by the Board. No other persons including the unsecured
creditors comes into picture like preparing the scheme
under Section 18. Section 18 of the SICA does not provide
that at the time of preparing of the scheme under Section
18 or when it is sanctioned by the Board, the unsecured
creditors are required to be heard. The only provision
for the consent required is Section 19 and the agency/
person, who is required to give the financial assistance,
its consent is required. Once the rehabilitation scheme/
scheme under Section 18 prepared by the operating agency
is sanctioned by the BIFR, which may include the scaling
down the value of dues of the unsecured creditors, the
same shall bind all, otherwise the rehabilitation scheme
shall not be workable at all and the object and purpose
of enactment of the SICA, 1985 will be frustrated. If some
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 391
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
persons/unsecured creditors and/or even the labourers
are permitted to get out of the purview of the scheme
and thereafter permitting such or some of the unsecured
creditors to wait till the scheme for rehabilitation of the sick
company has worked itself out, in that case, the scheme
shall not be workable at all. To make the company viable,
the concerned persons including the unsecured creditors
have to sacrifice to some extent otherwise the revival
efforts shall fail.
xxx xxx xxx
59. If the submission on behalf of the unsecured creditors,
which has been accepted by the High Court in the case of
Continental Carbon India Ltd. (supra) that an unsecured
creditor can opt out of the scheme sanctioned by the BIFR
under the SICA, 1985 and is allowed not to accept the
scaled down value of its dues and may wait till the scheme
for rehabilitation of the sick company has worked itself out,
with an option to recover the debt post such rehabilitation
is accepted/allowed, in that case, the minority creditors may
frustrate the rehabilitation scheme, which may frustrate the
object and purpose of enactment of SICA, 1985.
xxx xxx xxx
61. Thus, minority creditors and that too some unsecured
creditors cannot be permitted to stall the rehabilitation
of the sick company by not accepting the scaled down
value of its dues. Unless and until there is a sacrifice by
all concerned, including the creditors, financial institutions,
unsecured creditors, labourers, there shall not be any
revival of the sick industrial company/company.
62. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the
unsecured creditors that the unsecured creditors should
have an option not to accept the scaled down value of
its dues and to wait till the scheme for rehabilitation of
the sick company has worked itself out, with an option
to recover the debt post such rehabilitation is concerned,
the same has no substance and cannot be accepted. It
is required to be noted that in a given case, because of
392 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the scaling down of the value of the dues of the creditors,
the company survives. The company has survived in view
of the rehabilitation scheme because of the sacrifice/
scaling down the value of the dues of the creditors
including the financial institutions. How such a benefit
can be permitted to be given to the unsecured creditors,
who does not accept the scaled down value of its dues.
Such an unsecured creditor cannot be permitted to take
the benefit of the revival scheme, which is at the cost
of other creditors including the financial institutions and
even the labourers.
63. Now, so far as the view taken by the High Court
that the unsecured creditor had an option not to accept
the scaled down value of its dues and can wait till the
scheme for rehabilitation of the company has worked itself
out with an option to recover the debt with interest post
such rehabilitation is accepted, in a given case, the sick
company, which has been able to revive because of the
scaling down the value of the dues, may again become
sick, if the entire dues of the unsecured creditors are to
be paid thereafter. It may again lead to becoming such a
revived company again as a sick company. If such a thing
is permitted, in that case, it will again frustrate the object
and purpose of enactment of the SICA, 1985.
64. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the
unsecured creditors that to compel the unsecured creditors
to accept the scaled down value of its dues would
tantamount to and would be violative of Article 300A of the
Constitution of India is concerned, the same has also no
substance. Scaling down the value of the dues is under
the rehabilitation scheme prepared under Section 18 of
the SICA, which has a binding effect on all the creditors.
Therefore, the same cannot be said to be violative of Article
300A of the Constitution of India. The law permits framing
of the scheme taking into consideration and to provide
the measures contemplated under Section 18, therefore,
the rehabilitation scheme which provides for scaling down
the value of dues of the creditors/unsecured creditors and
even that of the labourers cannot be said to be violative
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 393
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
of Article 300A of the Constitution of India as submitted
on behalf of the unsecured creditors.
65. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above,
the view taken by the High Court of Delhi in Continental
Carbon India Ltd. (supra) that on approval of a scheme
by the BIFR under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special
Provisions) Act, 1985, the unsecured creditors has an
option not to accept the scaling down value of its dues and
to wait till the rehabilitation scheme of the sick company
has worked itself out with an option to recover the debt with
interest post such rehabilitation is erroneous and contrary
to the scheme of SICA, 1985 and the same deserves to
be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed
and set aside.”
(Emphasis supplied)
130. It is clear from the aforesaid observations of this Court that the
revival of a sick industry should be given utmost priority and any
interpretation which may result in a newly revived company becoming
sick again should be avoided at all costs. In the case on hand, the
decree in favour of the original plaintiff was not a part of the scheme
of rehabilitation approved by the BIFR. Had it been so, it is nothing
but obvious that the scheme would have proposed to settle the
dues of the original plaintiff at a scaled down value, since a similar
approach was adopted in the scheme to settle the dues of all the
other creditors. In that scenario, the original plaintiff would not have
had any other option but to accept the scaled down value and settle
its dues as per the dictum in Modi Rubber (supra).
131. The decree awarded by the trial court was contested by both the
parties before the High Court. No material was placed before us to
show whether any steps were taken by the original plaintiff to obtain
the permission of the BIFR for the execution of the decree of the
trial court, or for the inclusion of the said decree in the rehabilitation
scheme. At the same time, the original defendants too failed to bring
anything on record to show if any steps were taken by them for
the inclusion of the dues of the original plaintiff in the rehabilitation
scheme.
132. Although the facts of the case on hand are different from the facts in
Modi Rubber (supra), we are of the opinion that the general principles
394 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
enunciated in that case are equally applicable in the present case.
Thus, only for the reason that the dues of the original plaintiff were
not a part of the scheme and thus could not be settled at a scaled-
down value, it cannot be held that it will now be open for the original
plaintiff to recover its dues along with compound interest for the entire
period in a manner that will saddle the defendant company with
enormous liability, thereby possibly rendering the entire process of
its revival futile. This, in our view, could never have been the object
of the 1985 Act and the provisions of the 1993 Act thus have to be
harmonised so as to give effect to the true object of the 1985 Act.
133. We also had the occasion to look into the decision of a 2-Judge bench
of this Court in LML Limited v. Union of India & Others reported in
(2014) 13 SCC 375 wherein this Court was considering the purport
of Section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006 which is in pari-materia to
the Section 7 of the 1993 Act. The provisions read as under:
MSMED Act, 2006 The 1993 Act

[2024] 5 S.C.R. 395
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
134. In the aforesaid case, the petitioner therein, having become a sick
company, filed a reference to the BIFR under Section 15(1) of the
1985 Act. Around the same time, one of the respondents filed a claim
petition before the Industries Facilitation Council under Section 6 of
the 1993 Act. The 1993 Act was replaced by the MSMED Act, 2006
during the pendency of the proceedings. While the reference of the
company remained pending before the BIFR, the Industries Facilitation
Council passed an award in the favour of the said respondent, which
the petitioner sought to appeal under the Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996. However, both the District Court and the
High Court dismissed the challenge petition for not complying with
the Section 19 of the MSMED Act, 2006, which mandates that 75%
of the decretal/award amount has to be deposited by the appellant
before the appeal can be entertained by the appellate court.
135. However, this Court set aside the dismissal orders and held as follows:
“9. Having regard to the above position, we are satisfied
that this is not a case where we should go into the legal
question noted by us in the beginning of our order. We
are satisfied that interest of justice shall be subserved if
it is directed that failure to deposit the amount as directed
by the District Judge, Kanpur Nagar in its order dated
12-5-2011 would not result in dismissal of the arbitration
petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the 1996
Act challenging the award dated 22-12-2008. The said
arbitration petition may remain pending with the District
Judge until the finalisation of scheme by BIFR under
Section 18 of the 1985 Act. We order accordingly.
10. The special leave petition is disposed of as above.
Respondent 3 is granted liberty to apply to BIFR to hear
it before finalisation of the scheme. We observe that if
such an application is made, BIFR shall hear Respondent
3 before finalisation of the scheme or any other order
that may be passed by BIFR terminating the proceedings
under 1985 Act.”
(Emphasis supplied)
136. We would also like to advert to the principle of harmonious construction
to understand the interplay between the 1985 Act and the 1993 Act.
Simply put, the doctrine of harmonious construction is based on the
396 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
principle that the legislature would not lightly take away from one
hand what it had given with the other. Thus, this doctrine provides,
that as far as possible, two seemingly conflicting provisions within
a statute, or the seemingly conflicting provisions of one statute vis
a vis another, should be construed in a manner so as to iron out
any conflict.
137. Section 10 of the 1993 Act provides for an overriding effect to the
provisions of the said Act to the extent of inconsistency with any
other statute. Similarly, Section 32 of the 1985 Act provides overriding
effect to the provisions of the said Act except for the enactments
specified therein. Dealing with a case involving the apparent conflict
between the two statutes containing overriding provisions, this Court
in Sarwan Singh v. Shri Kasturi Lal reported in (1977) 1 SCC 750
held as follows:
“When two or more laws operate in the same field and
each contains a non obstante clause stating that its
provisions will override those of any other law, stimulating
and incisive problems of interpretation arise. Since statutory
interpretation has no conventional protocol, cases of such
conflict have to be decided in reference to the object and
purpose of the laws under consideration.”
(Emphasis supplied)
138. Similarly, in Jay Engineering (supra), it was observed by this Court
thus:
“31. The endeavour of the court would, however, always
be to adopt a rule of harmonious construction.”
139. We would also like to refer to a recent decision of the Madras High
Court in Metafilms India Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner (CT)
(Addl.), Amaindakarai Assessment Circle, Chennai and Others
reported in (2022) 96 GSTR 272. Although the said decision was
rendered in the peculiar facts of the case therein, yet the reasoning
behind the same appears to have been similar to the one that we
have employed. The relevant parts of the judgment are extracted
hereinbelow:
“27. Hence, the question would be, in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, what is the date,
on which, the repayment is due. As we have mentioned
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 397
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
earlier, the case on hand is very peculiar and appears
to have not arisen in any of the earlier litigations and
therefore, it requires to be dealt with in a different manner
and obviously on such a reasoning, any observation or
direction, which we may issue in this judgment, cannot be
treated as a precedent.
28. As mentioned above, the appellant was de-registered
by the BIFR on February 5, 2013. The first demand notice
was issued on March 20, 2013. However, the appellant
paid the dues only on April 25, 2015. The question would
be, in the facts and circumstances, what would be the
date, on which, the repayment of the loan is due.
29. The Department’s contention is that it should be
the date, on which, the default occurred. If that is to be
reckoned as the date, then an order of cancellation of the
agreement followed by recovery proceedings should have
been taken by the Department, which admittedly has not
been done. This is presumably for the reason that from
2003 to 2013, the appellant was before the Board and it
was declared as a sick industrial company and in terms of
section 22 of the SICA, the respondent-Department was
prohibited from proceeding with any recovery against the
appellant and this is a statutory prohibition, which binds
the respondent-Department.
30. From the representation given by the appellant to the
Government dated August 5, 2014, we find that the Sales
Tax Department did not appear before the Board on several
dates when the case was heard. Be that as it may, the
due date for repayment could have never occurred, in the
facts and circumstances, between August 1, 2003 when
the appellant was referred to the BIFR and May 31, 2006,
the appellant was declared as a sick industrial company
till its net worth turned positive and it was discharged from
the Board on February 5, 2013.
31. Thus, on facts, we hold that the date, on which, the
repayment became due for the appellant’s case shall
be fixed on February 6, 2013. Admittedly, the appellant
cleared the entire sales tax on April 25, 2015. Hence, for
398 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the period from February 6, 2013 to April 25, 2015, the
appellant is liable to pay interest.”
(Emphasis supplied)
140. For the period during which the defendant company was sick and
before the BIFR, it cannot be said that the withholding of the payment
of the dues of the original plaintiff was wilful and intentional. We say
so because first, the liability of the original defendants was disputed
and was finally adjudicated only by way of the impugned judgment,
much after the BIFR proceedings had come to an end; and secondly,
even if the liability of the original defendants was not disputed, or was
even acknowledged before the BIFR, recovery of the same could not
have been done without the permission of the BIFR in view of the
suspension of recovery proceedings by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
141. Thus, in view of our aforesaid discussion, we deem it fit to exclude
the period commencing from the date when FCIL was declared to
be a sick company under the 1985 Act going up to the date when
it was discharged by the BIFR and declared to be no longer a sick
industrial company from the purview of the applicability of the interest
provision under the 1993 Act. Thus, while the applicability of the
1993 Act to the dues of the original plaintiff is not disputed, such
interest shall not be calculated for the period between 06.11.1992
and 27.06.2013.
E. CONCLUSION
142. The net effect of the aforesaid discussion and findings is as follows:
I. The suit instituted by the original plaintiff before the trial court
was not hit by the embargo envisaged under Section 22(1) of
the 1985 Act. Thus, the decree awarded in favour of the original
plaintiff by the trial court and modified by the High Court, cannot
be said to be coram non-judice.
II. The High Court committed no error in awarding 24% interest to
the original plaintiff on its dues as per the provisions of the 1993
Act. However, the period during which the defendant company
was a sick company as per the 1985 Act should be excluded
for the purposes of calculation of interest.
143. As a result, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is
upheld subject to the modification of the period for which interest
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 399
Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v.
M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited
may be granted as discussed aforesaid. To clarify, the interest will
be calculated at 24% p.a. with monthly compounding.
144. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. The final
amount that may be determined in accordance with the final decree
shall be paid to the original plaintiff within a period of 4 weeks from
today, failing which interest at the rate of 36% p.a. with monthly
compounding shall accrue.
145. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
146. Parties to bear their own costs.

(Arbitration Petition No. 29 of 2023)
01 March 2024
[Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, CJI, J.B. Pardiwala*
and Manoj Misra, JJ.]","Whether the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to an application for
appointment of arbitrator u/s.11(6), Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996; if yes, whether the present petition is barred by limitation;
when does the right to apply u/s.11(6) accrues; whether the court
may refuse to make a reference u/s.11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and hopelessly
time-barred.
","Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Limitation
Act, 1963 – Article 137 – Applicability – Three franchise
agreements entered into between parties in 2013 – As per the
agreements, the petitioner-a company based in Afghanistan,
as the franchisee, was granted a non-exclusive license, by
the respondent to establish and operate businesses under
three trade names – Proposals were invited by the Indian
Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), for the execution of a
short-term course – Proposal of the respondent accepted –
Course executed by the petitioner at its centre in Kabul from
February to April, 2017 – Disputes arose between the parties in
relation to the renewal and payment of royalties for all the three
franchise agreements – Respondent issued recovery notice
for non-payment of royalty/renewal fees in 2018 – Petitioner
informed the respondent of its decision to not renew two
franchise agreements – In 2021, after a gap of around three
years, the petitioner again took up the issue of non-payment
of dues for the ICCR project with the respondent – Petitioner
invoked a pre-institution mediation in 2022 however, upon
failure thereof, it sent notice for invocation of arbitration to
the respondent – Respondent replied denying the claims

stating that notwithstanding the merits, the claims were barred
by limitation – Petitioner filed petition u/s.11(6) filed for the
appointment of an arbitrator:
Held: There is no doubt as to the applicability of the Limitation
Act, 1963 to arbitration proceedings in general and that of Article
137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to a petition u/s.11(6) in particular
– As is evident from Article 137, the limitation period for making
an application u/s.11(6) is three years from the date when the
right to apply accrues – Limitation period for filing an application
seeking appointment of arbitrator commences only after a valid
notice invoking arbitration has been issued by one of the parties
to the other party and there has been either a failure or refusal
on part of the other party to make an appointment as per the
appointment procedure agreed upon between the parties – The
request for appointment of an arbitrator was first made by the
petitioner vide notice dtd. 24.11.2022 and a time of one month from
the date of receipt of notice was given to the respondent to comply
with the said notice – Notice was delivered to the respondent on
29.11.2022 – Hence, the said period of one month from the date
of receipt came to an end on 28.12.2022 – Thus, it is only from
this day that the clock of limitation for filing the present petition
would start to tick – The present petition was filed by the petitioner
on 19.04.2023, well within the time period of 3 years provided by
Article 137 – Thus, the present petition u/s.11(6) cannot be said
to be barred by limitation – Further, the notice invoking arbitration
was received by the respondent on 29.11.2022, which is within
the three-year period from the date on which the cause of action
for the claim had arisen – Thus, it cannot be said that the claims
sought to be raised by the petitioner are ex-facie time-barred or
dead claims on the date of the commencement of arbitration –
Petition allowed, sole arbitrator appointed.[Paras 50-52, 62, 88, 92]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Petition
under, issue of limitation – Courts to satisfy themselves on
two aspects by employing a two-pronged test:
Held: While considering the issue of limitation in relation to a petition
u/s.11(6), the courts should satisfy themselves on two aspects by
employing a two-pronged test – first, whether the petition u/s.11(6)
is barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims sought
to be arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims and are thus barred by
limitation on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 75
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
– If either of these issues are answered against the party seeking
referral of disputes to arbitration, the court may refuse to appoint
an arbitral tribunal. [Para 89]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Ascertaining
the relevant point in time when the limitation period for making
a s.11(6) application would begin – Hohfeld’s analysis of jural
relations – Discussed.
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Application
for appointment of arbitrator u/s.11(6) – Categories of issues
– “jurisdictional issues/objections”; “admissibility issues/
objections”:
Held: Issues pertaining to the power and authority of the arbitrators
to hear and decide a case are referred to as the “jurisdictional
issues/objections” – Objections to the competence of arbitrators
to adjudicate a dispute, existence/validity of arbitration agreement,
absence of consent of the parties to submit the disputes to
arbitration, dispute falling out of the scope of the arbitration
agreement are some examples of jurisdictional or maintainability
issues – The second category referred to as the “admissibility is-
sues/objections” is of those issues which are related to the nature
of the claim and include challenges to procedural requirements,
viz. a mandatory requirement for pre-reference mediation; claim or
a part thereof being barred by limitation, etc. – Although, limitation
is an admissibility issue, yet it is the duty of the courts to prima-
facie examine and reject non-arbitrable or dead claims, so as to
protect the other party from being drawn into a time-consuming
and costly arbitration process. [Paras 64, 65]
Arbitration – Cause of action – When arises – Notice for
invocation of arbitration issued by the petitioner within three
years from the date of accrual of cause of action, claims not
ex-facie dead or time-barred on the date of commencement
of the arbitration proceedings:
Held: Mere failure to pay may not give rise to a cause of action
– However, once the applicant has asserted its claim and the
respondent has either denied such claim or failed to reply to it,
the cause of action will arise after such denial or failure – In the
present case, the petitioner alleged that the respondent received
the payment for the course from the ICCR on 03.10.2017 –
However, the perusal of the communication exchanged between
76 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the parties indicates that it was only on 28.03.2018 that the right
of the petitioner to bring a claim against the respondent could
be said to have been crystallised – Petitioner completed the
course sometime in April and a letter to this effect was issued
on 30.07.2017 by the EOI, Kabul – Allegedly, the ICCR made
payment to the respondent on 03.10.2017 – However, the right
of the petitioner to raise the claim could only be said to have
accrued after the petitioner made a positive assertion in March,
2018 which was denied by the respondent vide email dated
28.03.2018 – Another reminder through email was given by
the petitioner on 29.12.2018, however, mere giving reminders
and sending of letters would not extend the cause of action
any further from 28.03.2018 on which date the rights of the
petitioner could be said to have been crystallised – Thus, in
ordinary circumstances, the limitation period available to the
petitioner for raising a claim would have come to an end after
an expiry of three years, that is, on 27.03.2021 – However, in
March 2020, in view of deadly Covid-19 pandemic, this Court
directed the period commencing from 15.03.2020 to be excluded
for the purposes of computation of limitation – As a result, the
period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 was finally determined to
be excluded for the computation of limitation – It was provided
that the balance period of limitation as available on 15.03.2020
would become available from 01.03.2022 – The effect of the
said order of this Court in the facts of the present case is that
the balance limitation left on 15.03.2020 would become available
w.e.f. 01.03.2022 – The balance period of limitation remaining on
15.03.2020 can be calculated by computing the number of days
be-tween 15.03.2020 and 27.03.2021, which is the day when
the limitation period would have come to an end under ordinary
circumstances – The balance period thus comes to 1 year 13
days which became available to the petitioner from 01.03.2022,
thereby meaning that the limitation period available to the petitioner
for invoking arbitration proceedings would have come to an end
on 13.03.2023 – Notice for invocation of arbitration having been
issued by the petitioner within three years from the date of accrual
of cause of action, the claims cannot be said to be ex-facie dead
or time-barred on the date of commence-ment of the arbitration
proceedings. [Paras 77, 81, 82, 84 and 91]

of arbitral proceedings:
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 77

Held: s.21 provides that the arbitral proceedings in relation to a
dispute commence when a notice invoking arbitration is sent by
the claimant to the other party. [Para 85]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.11(6) – Limitation Act,
1963 – Article 137 – Applicability of Article 137 to applications
u/s.11(6), a result of legislative vacuum – Parliament should
consider bringing an amendment to the Act, 1996 prescribing
a specific period of limitation:
Held: Applicability of Article 137 to applications u/s.11(6), a result
of legislative vacuum as there is no statutory prescription regarding
the time limit – Period of three years is an unduly long period
for filing an application u/s.11 of the Act, 1996 and goes against
the very spirit of the Act, 1996 which provides for expeditious
resolution of commercial disputes within a time-bound manner –
Various amendments to the Act, 1996 have been made over the
years to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted and
concluded expeditiously – Parliament should consider bringing
an amendment to the Act, 1996 prescribing a specific period of
limitation within which a party may move the court for making an
application for appointment of arbitrators u/s.11 of the Act, 1996.

providing training to desirous students in computer education, English
language, information technology, etc. praying for the appointment of
an arbitrator for the adjudication of disputes and claims arising from
the Contract dated 21.03.2013 entered into between the petitioner
and the respondent.
A. FACTUAL MATRIX
2. The petitioner, M/s Arif Azim Co. Ltd., is a company based in
Afghanistan, having its registered office at 1st Floor, Zarnigar Hotel,
Mohammed Jan Khan Watt, Kabul, Afghanistan and is engaged in
the business of providing training in computer education, information
technology, English language, etc.
3. The respondent, M/s Aptech Limited, is a company having its
registered office at Aptech House, A-65, MIDC Marol, Andheri (E),
Mumbai – 400093, Maharashtra, India and is engaged in the business
of providing training and education in information technology through
its network in India and abroad.
4. On 21.03.2013, three separate franchise agreements were entered
into between petitioner/franchisee and the respondent/franchisor. As
per the terms of the said agreements, the petitioner, as the franchisee,
was granted a non-exclusive license, by the respondent to establish
and operate businesses under the following trade names:
I. Aptech English Language Academy (for short, “AELA”)
II. Aptech Computer Education (for short, “ACE”)
III. Aptech Hardware and Networking Academy (for short, “AHNA”)
5. The dispute in the present case pertains to the agreement entered
into between the parties for the AELA. A perusal of the recitals of
the said agreement reveals that the respondent company has the
expertise in imparting training in information technology and had
developed content and established programs for training in computer-
based information. The programs developed by the respondent under
the brand name AELA included the recurring use of trade names,
trademarks, advertising and publicity, distinctive style and character
of premises and furnishings, support and placement program for
students, etc. The petitioner, desirous of establishing a centre for
providing training in information technology in the courses conducted
by the respondent with a view to train and educate students to enable
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 81
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
them to appear and qualify in the said courses, had approached the
respondent as a result of which the franchise agreements for AELA,
ACE and AHNA were entered into between the parties.
6. The relevant clauses of the AELA franchise agreement are reproduced
hereinbelow:

22. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the Indian laws.”
7. Pursuant to the signing of the aforesaid agreement, proposals were
invited by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, Azad Bhavan,
Indraprastha Estate, New Delhi – 110002 (for short, “the ICCR”) in
2016 for the execution of a short-term course for training in English
for students from Afghanistan who were selected to pursue degree
courses in Indian Universities in the academic year 2017-18 under
the scholarship scheme of the Government of India (for short, “the
course”). The proposal of the respondent was accepted by the
ICCR vide Sanction Order No. SSSAN-2017-18 dated 10.10.2016.
The sanction order prescribed the schedule for the conduct of the
course, submission of progress report to the Embassy of India in
Kabul (for short, “EOI, Kabul”) etc. and also approved the training
fees at Rs 5,000/- + service tax per student per month. The order
also stipulated that the payments for the course would be released to
the respondent by the ICCR at the end of every month after getting
an endorsement from the EOI, Kabul.
8. After securing the aforesaid sanction order, the respondent vide email
dated 17.10.2016 addressed to the petitioner Company informed
about the sanction order and stated that the respondent would speak
to the petitioner for the implementation of the said order once the
expectations of the ICCR for the course were understood.
9. Subsequently, a series of emails were exchanged between
the petitioner and the respondent regarding the details of the
course including the syllabus, learning outcomes, class schedule,
qualifications, salary and number of trainers, etc.
10. The EOI, Kabul vide email dated 24.12.2016, informed the petitioner
that although the applications of Afghan students were already sent
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 87
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
to the Indian Universities, yet the Universities had not started granting
admissions to them and thus it was suggested by the ICCR that the
course should begin from the last week of January/ First week of
February, 2017.
11. The course was executed by the petitioner at its centre in Kabul
from February to April, 2017 for 440 Afghan students. The same was
certified by the EOI, Kabul vide its letter no. KAB/327/05/2016-17
dated 30.07.2017.
12. Vide letters dated 04.08.2017 and 14.08.2017 respectively addressed
to the EOI, Kabul, the program director for the ICCR requested for
month-wise details/number of students who attended the course so
as to process the payments for the course to the respondent.
13. Meanwhile disputes arose between the parties in relation to
the renewal and payment of royalties for all the three franchise
agreements entered into by the parties in March, 2013. Vide email
dated 20.03.2018 addressed to the petitioner, the respondent issued
a recovery notice for non-payment of royalty/renewal fees. The email
stated that due to the non-payment of outstanding royalty, the portal
operations for AELA and ACE would be shut by 21.03.2018 and by
the month-end for the AHNA portal.
14. The petitioner replied to the aforesaid recovery notice vide email
dated 23.03.2018, however the contents of the same have not been
placed on record. The respondent replied to the reply email of the
petitioner vide email dated 27.03.2018 stating that despite having
sent the invoices for pending royalties, nothing had been received
by the respondent. Responding to the issue of non-payment for the
course conducted by the petitioner, the respondent stated in the
said email that they had not received the full amount from the ICCR,
which had officially held back 22% of the payment for deductions of
quality. The respondent also called upon the petitioner to urgently
address, inter-alia, the issue of renewal of the franchise agreements.
15. Responding to the above referred email on the very same day, i.e.,
27.03.2018, the petitioner stated that it had hired 7 Indian and 4
local English trainers for executing the course and since the course
had been executed in Afghanistan, it was entitled to receive 90% of
the payments received by the respondent from Aptech India. The
petitioner further requested the respondent to share the details of
the amount received from the ICCR after the 22% deduction to
88 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
enable them to make the calculations and finalise the payment
accordingly.
16. The respondent vide an email dated 28.03.2018 replied to the above
email of the petitioner stating that it had received only 61.5% of the
claimed amount from the ICCR after quality and TDS deductions.
The respondent further mentioned that it was entitled to 15% royalty
as opposed to the 10% stated by the petitioner and that it had
incurred some incidental expenses for the project. The respondent
also stressed on the issue of payment of outstanding royalty and
renewal, calling upon the petitioner to address them first.
17. The petitioner replied to the above email on the same day disputing
the percentage of royalty fee to which the respondent was entitled.
The petitioner further stated that it had no issues regarding the
quality deductions made by the ICCR, however it needed to know
the exact amount disbursed by the ICCR to the respondent so that
it could calculate its share from the same and adjust them towards
the pending dues.
18. From the email exchanges placed on record, it is clear that the
discussions regarding the non-payment of the amount received from
the ICCR came to a halt between the parties on 28.03.2018, however
the discussions regarding the renewal of the agreements continued.
Finally, on 23.04.2018, the petitioner informed the respondent of its
decision to not renew the franchise agreements for the ACE and AELA
in light of the dispute regarding the payment for the course executed by
the petitioner. However, the agreement for AHNA was renewed and the
respondent acknowledged the same vide an email on the same day.
19. After about nine months, the petitioner once again sent an email to
the respondent on 29.12.2018, raising the issue of the non-payment
of the dues for the ICCR project. Although the said email refers
to some phone calls and WhatsApp communication regarding the
payment for the course, nothing has been placed on record by the
petitioner to that effect. Vide the said email, the petitioner once
again requested the respondent to provide accounting details for
the expenses incurred and payment received from the ICCR for the
course. The petitioner also mentioned that it had incurred expenses
amounting to $ 60,000/- on salary, lodging and food for the trainers.
20. As it appears from the record, it is only after a gap of around
three years that the petitioner again took up the issue of non-
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 89
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
payment of dues for the ICCR project with the respondent,
vide a legal notice dated 26.08.2021. Through the notice, the
petitioner called upon the respondent to pay Rs 73,53,000/- with
18% interest compounded monthly w.e.f. 01.11.2017 within 15
days of the receipt of the notice. The notice further stated that in
the event of the respondent failing to comply with the aforesaid
demand, the petitioner would file appropriate proceedings before
the competent courts including a suit for settlement of accounts
for recovery and also by way of damages or otherwise for breach
of trust and breach of contract.
21. Again, after about 10 months, the petitioner invoked a pre-institution
mediation before the Main Mediation Centre, Bombay High Court
on 05.07.2022 in accordance with Section 12A of the Commercial
Courts Act, 2015 making the respondent and the ICCR as party
respondents. Notice was issued in the said mediation proceedings
and 12.08.2022 was scheduled as the date for appearance of the
parties. Upon failure of the parties to be present on the said date,
24.08.2022 was fixed as the next date for appearance. However, on
the said date, the opposite parties submitted letters refusing to go
into mediation and thus a non-starter report dated 24.08.2022 was
issued under Rule 3(4) of the Commercial Courts (Pre-Institution
Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018.
22. After the failure of mediation as aforesaid, the petitioner sent notice
for invocation of arbitration to the respondent on 24.11.2022. Vide the
notice, the petitioner called upon the respondent to pay an amount of
Rs 1,48,31,067/- inclusive of interest of Rs 82,13,367/- and nominated
Mr V. Giri and Mr M.L. Verma, Senior Advocates practicing in this
Court as its nominee arbitrators.
23. The respondent replied to the aforesaid notice vide letter dated
05.04.2023 denying all the claims raised by the petitioner in the notice
dated 24.11.2022. It further stated that notwithstanding the merits,
the claims were barred by limitation. The respondent also stated
that the mediation proceedings initiated before the Bombay High
Court were under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
which is a mandatory requirement before filing a commercial suit,
and thus it was not open to the petitioner to link it to the conciliation
as envisaged in the clause 21 of the franchise agreement for AELA
as extracted hereinbefore.
90 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
24. The present petition then came to be filed by the petitioner on
19.04.2023 before this Court after the failure of the respondent in
nominating an arbitrator as per the mutually agreed upon procedure
in response to notice for invocation of arbitration.
B. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
25. Mr. R. Sathish, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
submitted that this Court has the requisite jurisdiction to take
necessary measures for the constitution of an arbitral tribunal under
Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 as the case at hand pertains to an
“international commercial arbitration” within the meaning of Section
2(f) of the Act, 1996. Further, clause 21 of the AELA agreement
provides for appointment of a three-membered arbitral tribunal in
case a dispute arises and cannot be resolved through conciliation
between the parties.
26. The counsel submitted that the petitioner, as an independent
non-exclusive partner of the respondent, is entirely responsible
for the conduct of the course as per clause 17.03 of the franchise
agreement and is thus entitled to receive 90% of the payments
received by the respondent from the ICCR after successful
completion of the course.
27. The counsel argued that as the principal contract for the course
was signed between the ICCR and the respondent, the grant in aid
of Rs 73,53,000/- was transferred by the ICCR to the respondent
on 03.10.2017 after the certificate of successful completion of the
course was issued by the EOI, Kabul. However, since the course
was executed in Afghanistan by the petitioner as the franchisee, it
is entitled to received 90% of the amount received as per the AELA
franchise agreement.
28. The counsel further submitted that the respondent had neither
informed nor disclosed the amount received from the ICCR despite
repeated requests made by the petitioner for settlement of accounts.
The petitioner further contended that the experience of the respondent
with the ICCR and Government of India cannot be a ground for
withholding of the payments by the respondent.
29. The counsel argued that the cause of action first arose on 03.10.2017
when the respondent withheld the information of receipt of Rs
73,53,000/- from the ICCR. The cause of action further arose on
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 91
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
28.03.2018 when the respondent informed that cash-flow wise it had
received only 61.5% of the claimed amount from the ICCR and that
it had incurred some incidental expenses for the project.
30. The petitioner contended that since the respondent has failed to
disclose the amount received from ICCR till date, it has resulted in
a continuing cause of action as the petitioner couldn’t quantify the
total amount due along with interest as exact details of the amount
received by the respondent from the ICCR were not disclosed.
31. The counsel submitted that as the cause of action for full and final
settlement of claims was yet to accrue, the reliance placed by the
respondent on the decision of this Court in M/s B and T AG v.
Ministry of Defence reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 657 was
misconceived.
32. The counsel submitted that a force majeure situation as per clause
13 of the AELA agreement was created due to the coming back of
Taliban in Afghanistan in August, 2021. It was contended by the
petitioner that this resulted in the break-down of all communication
channels disabling the petitioner from approaching the courts on
time despite of doing everything in its power.
33. The counsel further submitted that the petitioner is entitled to get the
benefit of the extension of limitation period as directed by this Court
in SMW(C) No. 03 of 2020 by which the period from 15.03.2020 to
28.02.2022 is liable to be excluded for the purposes of computing
limitation.
34. The counsel submitted that upon failure of the respondent in replying
to its claims and legal notice, it had approached the Bombay High
Court Mediation Centre under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts
Act, 2015 and had initiated pre-reference mediation in accordance
with the terms of the arbitration clause in the AELA agreement. It
was further submitted that in any view of the matter, the petitioner is
not estopped from invoking arbitration under clause 21 of the AELA
agreement after having invoked pre-litigation mediation under the
Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
35. Finally, the counsel prayed for passing an order referring the dispute
to arbitration with a view to adjudicate the differences between the
parties as contemplated in clause 21 of the AELA agreement dated
21.03.2013.
92 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
36. At the outset, Mr. Rana Mukherjee, the learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that the disputes
raised by the petitioner are not arbitrable as the claims made by the
petitioner relate to the sanction letter dated 10.10.2016 issued by the
ICCR to the respondent which is not a part of the AELA franchise
agreement entered into between the parties on 21.03.2013. Thus,
in the absence of any arbitration clause in the aforesaid sanction
order, and it being unrelated to the AELA franchise agreement, the
petitioner cannot invoke arbitration for the adjudication of the claims.
37. It was further submitted by him that on the contrary, as per the
AELA franchise agreement, it was the respondent who was entitled
to receive royalty fee from the petitioner at the rates prescribed in
the franchise agreement, and there was no arrangement by which
the petitioner was entitled to a 90% payment.
38. The learned Senior counsel vehemently argued that notwithstanding
the merits of the claim, the same is hopelessly barred by limitation
on the face of it by virtue of the applicability of Article 137 of the
Limitation Act, 1963. The dispute, as per the legal notice dated
26.08.2021 issued by the petitioner to the respondent, arose on
01.11.2017 and thus the limitation period, even after considering the
covid exclusion, had come to an end much prior to the date when
the notice for invocation of arbitration was issued by the petitioner on
24.11.2022. Further, the plea of a force-majeure event due to coming
back of Taliban in Afghanistan, as raised by the petitioner is not
bona-fide as most of the exchanges between the parties took place
on email and the email facility was available to the petitioner even in
the month of August, 2021. The counsel submitted that no effective
steps were taken by the petitioner even after the covid period came
to an end indicating that the petitioner was not vigilant in protecting its
rights and hence the petition was liable to be dismissed as barred by
limitation. The counsel contended that the mere exchange of letters
would not extend the cause of action and the period of limitation for
the purposes of filing the arbitration petition.
39. It was further submitted that the invocation of pre-litigation mediation
proceedings before the Bombay High Court Mediation Centre by the
petitioner was under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
which is a mandatory pre-condition before institution of a commercial
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 93
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
suit under the said Act and the petitioner should not be allowed
to change course by invoking arbitration after having previously
submitted to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.
Further, the petitioner made the ICCR as a party in the mediation
proceedings before the High Court and the ICCR also participated
in the said proceedings. Thus, it is evident that the dispute arising
out of the tripartite arrangement between the petitioner, respondent
and the ICCR has no nexus with the arbitration clause of the AELA
franchise agreement.
40. An objection was raised by the learned counsel towards the identity
of the Deponent to the affidavit in support of the present arbitration
petition on the ground that no Power of Attorney or Letter of Authority
could have been executed by the petitioner in favour of the Deponent
to the Affidavit.
41. One another submission made by the counsel was that the notice
for invocation of arbitration sent by the petitioner was not a valid
notice as per clause 21 of the franchise agreement being contrary
to the arbitration clause which provides for appointment of three
arbitrators, the notice mentions appointment of a sole arbitrator
and proposes names of two arbitrators, and on this ground too, the
petition is liable to be dismissed.
42. Placing reliance on the judgment of this Court in M/s B and T AG
(supra) the learned senior counsel submitted that the present petition
squarely falls within the dictum laid down in the said judgment and
is thus hopelessly barred by limitation.
D. ANALYSIS
43. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
having perused the material on record, the following two questions
fall for our consideration:
I. Whether the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to an
application for appointment of arbitrator under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996? If yes,
whether the present petition is barred by limitation?
II. Whether the court may refuse to make a reference under
Section 11 of Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and
hopelessly time-barred?
94 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
i. Issue No. 1: Whether the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable
to an application for appointment of arbitrator under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996? If yes,
whether the present petition is barred by limitation?
44. The basic premise behind the statutes providing for a limitation period
is encapsulated by the maxim “Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura
subveniunt” which translates to “the law assists those who are vigilant
and not those who sleep over their rights”. The object behind having
a prescribed limitation period is to ensure that there is certainty and
finality to litigation and assurance to the opposite party that it will not
be subject to an indefinite period of liability. Another object achieved
by a fixed limitation period is to only allow those claims which are
initiated before the deterioration of evidence takes place. The law of
limitation does not act to extinguish the right but only bars the remedy.
45. The plain reading of Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, which provides for
the appointment of arbitrators, indicates that no time-limit has been
prescribed for filing an application under the said section. However,
Section 43 of the Act, 1996 provides that the Limitation Act, 1963
would apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. The
aforesaid section is reproduced hereinbelow:
“43. Limitations.—(1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of
1963), shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings
in court.
(2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation
Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an arbitration shall be deemed to
have commenced on the date referred to in section 21.
(3) Where an arbitration agreement to submit future
disputes to arbitration provides that any claim to which
the agreement applies shall be barred unless some step
to commence arbitral proceedings is taken within a time
fixed by the agreement, and a dispute arises to which
the agreement applies, the Court, if it is of opinion that
in the circumstances of the case undue hardship would
otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the time
so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the
justice of the case may require, extend the time for such
period as it thinks proper.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 95
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
(4) Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set
aside, the period between the commencement of the
arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall
be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the
Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement
of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to
the dispute so submitted.”
46. Since none of the Articles in the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963
provide a time period for filing an application under Section 11(6) of
the Act, 1996, it would be covered by Article 137 of the Limitation
Act, 1963 which is the residual provision and reads as under:
Description of Period of Time from which
Application limitation period begins to run
137. Any other application Three When the right to
for which no period of years apply accrues.

Division
47. In his authoritative commentary, “International Commercial Arbitration,
Wolters Kluwer, 3rd Edition, pp. 2873-2875”, Gary B. Born has
observed that as a general rule, limitation statutes are applicable to
arbitration proceedings. The relevant extract is as follows:
“Most nations impose limitation or prescription periods
within which civil claims must be brought. Of course,
statutes of limitation differ from country to country. As
discussed below, statutes of limitations are virtually always
applicable in international arbitration proceedings, in the
same way that they apply in national court proceedings.
Choosing between various potentially-applicable statutes
of limitations in international arbitration raises significant
choice-of-law questions.
xxx xxx xxx
Conflict of laws issues also arise as to the date that the
statute of limitations period is tolled. The issue can be
addressed by national laws, as well as by institutional
arbitration rules. Unfortunately, inconsistencies can arise
96 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
between institutional rules and one or more potentially-
applicable national laws (which may also apply in a
mandatory fashion). For counsel in a particular dispute,
of course, the only safe course is to satisfy the shortest
potentially-applicable limitations period.”
(emphasis supplied)
48. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering
Ltd. and Another reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618 held that the issue
of limitation being one of threshold importance, it must be decided
at the pre-reference stage, so that the other party is not dragged
through a long-drawn arbitration, which would be expensive and
time consuming.
49. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Geo Miller and Company
Private Limited v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam
Limited reported in (2020) 14 SCC 643 observed as follows:
“14. Sections 43(1) and (3) of the 1996 Act are in pari
materia with Sections 37(1) and (4) of the 1940 Act. It is
well-settled that by virtue of Article 137 of the First Schedule
to the Limitation Act, 1963 the limitation period for reference
of a dispute to arbitration or for seeking appointment of
an arbitrator before a court under the 1940 Act (see State
of Orissa v. Damodar Das [(1996) 2 SCC 216] ) as well
as the 1996 Act (see Grasim Industries Ltd. v. State of
Kerala [ (2018) 14 SCC 265 : (2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 612] )
is three years from the date on which the cause of action
or the claim which is sought to be arbitrated first arises.
15. In Damodar Das [(1996) 2 SCC 216], this Court
observed, relying upon Russell on Arbitration by Anthony
Walton (19th Edn.) at pp. 4-5 and an earlier decision of a
two-Judge Bench in Panchu Gopal Bose v. Port of Calcutta
[(1993) 4 SCC 338], that the period of limitation for an
application for appointment of arbitrator under Sections
8 and 20 of the 1940 Act commences on the date on
which the “cause of arbitration” accrued i.e. from the date
when the claimant first acquired either a right of action or
a right to require that an arbitration take place upon the
dispute concerned.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 97
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
16. We also find the decision in Panchu Gopal Bose
[(1993) 4 SCC 338] relevant for the purpose of this case.
This was a case similar to the present set of facts, where
the petitioner sent bills to the respondent in 1979, but
payment was not made. After an interval of a decade, he
sent a notice to the respondent in 1989 for reference to
arbitration. This Court in Panchu Gopal Bose [(1993) 4
SCC 338] observed that in mercantile references of this
kind, it is implied that the arbitrator must decide the dispute
according to the existing law of contract, and every defence
which would have been open to the parties in a court of
law, such as the plea of limitation, would be open to the
parties for the arbitrator’s decision as well. Otherwise, as
this Court observed : (SCC p. 344, para 8)
“8. … a claim for breach of contract containing
a reference clause could be brought at any
time, it might be 20 or 30 years after the cause
of action had arisen, although the legislature
has prescribed a limit of three years for the
enforcement of such a claim in any application
that might be made to the law courts.”
17. This Court further held as follows: (Panchu Gopal Bose
case [ (1993) 4 SCC 338] , SCC pp. 345-46, paras 11-12)
“11. Therefore, the period of limitation for the commencement
of an arbitration runs from the date on which, had there
been no arbitration clause, the cause of action would have
accrued. Just as in the case of civil actions the claim is not
to be brought after the expiration of a specified number of
years from the date on which the cause of action accrued,
so in the case of arbitrations, the claim is not to be put
forward after the expiration of the specified number of
years from the date when the claim accrued.
12. In Russell on Arbitration….
At p. 80 it is stated thus:
‘An extension of time is not automatic and it is only granted
if “undue hardship” would otherwise be caused. Not all
hardship, however, is “undue hardship”; it may be proper
98 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that hardship caused to a party by his own default should
be borne by him, and not transferred to the other party
by allowing a claim to be reopened after it has become
barred.’ ”

50. Having traversed the statutory framework and case law, we are of
the clear view that there is no doubt as to the applicability of the
Limitation Act, 1963 to arbitration proceedings in general and that
of Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to a petition under Section
11(6) of the Act, 1996 in particular. Having held thus, the next question
that falls for our determination is whether the present petition seeking
appointment of an arbitrator is barred by limitation.
51. The determination of the aforesaid question is an exercise involving
both law and facts. As is evident from Article 137 of the Limitation Act,
1963, the limitation period for making an application under Section
11(6) of the Act, 1996 is three years from the date when the right
to apply accrues. Thus, to determine whether the present petition
is barred by limitation, it is necessary to ascertain when the right to
file the present petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 accrued
in favour of the petitioner.
a. When does the right to apply under Section 11(6) accrue?
52. It has been held in a catena of decisions of this Court that the
limitation period for making an application seeking appointment of
arbitrator must not be conflated or confused with the limitation period
for raising the substantive claims which are sought to be referred
to an arbitral tribunal. The limitation period for filing an application
seeking appointment of arbitrator commences only after a valid
notice invoking arbitration has been issued by one of the parties to
the other party and there has been either a failure or refusal on part
of the other party to make an appointment as per the appointment
procedure agreed upon between the parties.
53. O.P. Malhotra in The Law & Practice of Arbitration and Conciliation,
3rd Edition, pp. 688-689 has summarised the position of law on the
limitation period for a Section 11(6) petition thus:
“There is no specific period of limitation prescribed for
making the request under Section 11(6) to the Chief
Justice or his designate, to take the necessary measure
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 99
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
for appointing an arbitrator. Therefore, Article 137 of the
Limitation Act, 1963, which provides the limitation period
of three years for filing any other application for which
no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in the third
division of the Schedule of the Act from the day when the
right to apply accrues. It is the residuary article in regard
to the applications, and it can only be applied if no other
article is applicable. It would only apply to an application
where it is required by law to be made. It is restricted to
applications for the exercise of the Acts and powers which
the court is not bound to perform suo motu. Therefore,
the period of limitation for making a request under Section
11(6) is three years, and the limitation is to be counted
from the date on which 30 days from the date of notice by
one party to the other for appointing arbitrator expires. The
question whether the claims/disputes made in reference
to arbitration was valid is a question to be decided by
the arbitrator, and not by the appointing authority of the
arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act. The appointing
authority is certainly required to ascertain whether the
application under Section 11(6) of the Act was barred by
time.”
(emphasis supplied)
54. Dr. P.C. Markanda in Law Pertaining to Arbitration and Conciliation,
9th Edition, LexisNexis, pp. 550-551 has discussed on the applicability
of law of limitation to a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996
as follows:
“For the purpose of examining the right of the petitioner
to apply under sub section (6) for calculating the period of
limitation, it is necessary to establish, in the first instance,
the relevant date when the right to apply accrued in favour
of the petitioner. It is the date on which the right to apply
accrues that determines the starting point. The starting
point does not coincide with the date on which the cause of
action for filing a suit arises. Whether the claims of a party
are barred by limitation or not is for the arbitrator to see,
but it is the duty of the court to see whether the application
filed in the court is within limitation or not. Limitation for
filing application under sub-section (4) would commence
100 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
only from the expiry of 30 days from the receipt of request
mentioned in sub-section (4)(a) or (b) and the limitation
for an application under sub-section (6) would commence
from the happening of the contingencies mentioned in sub-
clauses (a) or (b) or (c) thereof. The procedure prescribed
under this section is mandatory and Art. 137, Limitation
Act providing for limitation shall apply.
xxx xxx xxx
It would be entirely wrong to mix the two aspects, namely
whether there was any valid claim and secondly the claim
to be adjudicated by the arbitrator was barred by time. As
for the second matter, it is for the arbitrator to see whether
the claim was within limitation or not and the court should
confine itself to see whether the application made to the
court is within limitation. An application made more than
three years after the accrual of cause of action is palpably
time barred and liable to be dismissed. Article 137 of the
Limitation Act makes it obligatory for claims to be filed
within 3 years of the rescission/termination of the contract.
The right of action for the department starts from the date
when the work is rescinded and not from the date when
the balance work is got completed through another agency.
If the petitioner delays invocation of arbitration clause for
months together for no justifiable cause after the period
prescribed in the arbitration agreement had elapsed, the
court would not come to the rescue of such a party seeking
appointment of arbitrator and the abnormal delay of more
than a year cannot be condoned.”
(emphasis supplied)
55. This Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited & Another v. Nortel
Networks India Private Limited reported in (2021) 5 SCC 738
held thus:
“15. It is now fairly well-settled that the limitation for filing
an application under Section 11 would arise upon the
failure to make the appointment of the arbitrator within
a period of 30 days from issuance of the notice invoking
arbitration. In other words, an application under Section 11
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 101
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
can be filed only after a notice of arbitration in respect of
the particular claim(s)/dispute(s) to be referred to arbitration
[as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is made, and
there is failure to make the appointment.
16. The period of limitation for filing a petition seeking
appointment of an arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or
conflated with the period of limitation applicable to the
substantive claims made in the underlying commercial
contract. The period of limitation for such claims is
prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act,
1963. The limitation for deciding the underlying substantive
disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an
application for appointment of an arbitrator. This position
was recognised even under Section 20 of the Arbitration
Act, 1940. Reference may be made to the judgment of
this Court in J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd.
[(2008) 2 SCC 444 : (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 582] wherein
it was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides
that for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration
is deemed to have commenced when one party to the
arbitration agreement serves on the other party, a notice
requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Para 26 of this
judgment reads as follows : (SCC p. 460)
“26. Section 37(3) of the Act provides that for
the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration
is deemed to have been commenced when
one party to the arbitration agreement serves
on the other party thereto, a notice requiring
the appointment of an arbitrator. Such a notice
having been served on 4-6-1980, it has to be
seen whether the claims were in time as on that
date. If the claims were barred on 4-6-1980, it
follows that the claims had to be rejected by
the arbitrator on the ground that the claims
were barred by limitation. The said period has
nothing to do with the period of limitation for filing
a petition under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar
as a petition under Section 8(2) is concerned,
the cause of action would arise when the other
102 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
party fails to comply with the notice invoking
arbitration. Therefore, the period of limitation
for filing a petition under Section 8(2) seeking
appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused
with the period of limitation for making a claim.
The decisions of this Court in Inder Singh Rekhi
v. DDA [(1988) 2 SCC 338], Panchu Gopal
Bose v. Port of Calcutta [(1993) 4 SCC 338]
and Utkal Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal
Fields Ltd. [(1999) 2 SCC 571] also make this
position clear.”
(emphasis supplied)
56. The other way of ascertaining the relevant point in time when the
limitation period for making a Section 11(6) application would begin
is by making use of the Hohfeld’s analysis of jural relations. It is a
settled position of law that the limitation period under Article 137 of the
Limitation Act, 1963 will commence only after the right to apply has
accrued in favour of the applicant. As per Hohfeld’s scheme of jural
relations, conferring of a right on one entity must entail the vesting of
a corresponding duty in another. When an application under Section
11(6) of the Act, 1996 is made before this Court without exhausting
the mechanism prescribed under the said sub-section, including that
of invoking arbitration by issuance of a formal notice to the other
party, this Court is not duty bound to appoint an arbitrator and can
reject the application for being premature and non-compliant with the
statutory mandate. However, once the procedure laid down under
Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is exhausted by the applicant and
the application passes all other tests of limited judicial scrutiny as
have been evolved by this Court over the years, this Court becomes
duty-bound to appoint an arbitrator and refer the matter to an arbitral
tribunal. Thus, the “right to apply” of the Applicant can be said to have
as its jural corelative the “duty to appoint” of this Court only after all
the steps required to be completed before instituting a Section 11(6)
application have been duly completed. Thus, the limitation period
for filing a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 can only
commence once a valid notice invoking arbitration has been sent
by the applicant to the other party, and there has been a failure or
refusal on part of that other party in complying with the requirements
mentioned in such notice.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 103
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
57. This Court in Utkal Commercial Corporation v. Central Coal
Fields Ltd. reported in (1999) 2 SCC 571 while determining a similar
question in relation to the Arbitration Act, 1940 held thus:
“6. Therefore, the time for the purposes of limitation begins
to run from the date when the right to make an application
under Section 8 accrues. Section 8 of the Arbitration Act,
which is relevant for our present purposes, is reproduced
below:
“8. Power of court to appoint arbitrator or umpire.—(1)
In any of the following cases—
(a) where an arbitration agreement provides that
the reference shall be to one or more arbitrators
to be appointed by consent of the parties, and all
the parties do not, after differences have arisen,
concur in the appointment or appointments; or
(b)-(c)***
any party may serve the other parties or the arbitrators,
as the case may be, with a written notice to concur in
the appointment or appointments or in supplying the
vacancy.
(2) If the appointment is not made within fifteen clear
days after service of the said notice, the court may, on
the application of the party who gave the notice and after
giving the other parties an opportunity of being heard,
appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case
may be, who shall have like power to act in the reference
and to make an award as if he or they had been appointed
by consent of all parties.”
7. Therefore, under Section 8, before an application can
be made to the court under that section, the following
requirements should be satisfied:
(1) The arbitration agreement should provide for
appointment of arbitrator/s by consent.
(2) Parties do not concur in the appointment of an
arbitrator.
104 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(3) One party serves notice on the other party to
concur in the appointment.
(4) No appointment is made within 15 days of the
service of the notice.
8. Thereupon the court may, on the application of the party
who gave the notice and after giving the other party an
opportunity of being heard, appoint an arbitrator.
9. In view of the express language of Section 8, it is quite
clear that unless a party who desires to apply has resorted
to the process set out in Section 8, and has failed to secure
the concurrence of the other party to the appointment of
an arbitrator within the prescribed period, the court will
not intervene under Section 8. The right to apply under
Section 8, therefore, would accrue when, within 15 clear
days of the notice, the other parties do not concur in the
appointment of an arbitrator.”
(emphasis supplied)
58. In Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah &
Sons reported in (2021) 5 SCC 705, this Court while determining
the issue of limitation in relation to a Section 11(6) petition under
the Act, 1996 held thus:
“19. Applying the aforesaid judgments to the facts of
this case, so far as the applicability of Article 137 of the
Limitation Act to the applications under Section 11 of the
Arbitration Act is concerned, it is clear that the demand
for arbitration in the present case was made by the
letter dated 7-11-2006. This demand was reiterated by
a letter dated 13-1-2007, which letter itself informed the
appellant that appointment of an arbitrator would have
to be made within 30 days. At the very latest, therefore,
on the facts of this case, time began to run on and from
12-2-2007. The appellant’s laconic letter dated 23-1-2007,
which stated that the matter was under consideration,
was within the 30-day period. On and from 12-2-2007,
when no arbitrator was appointed, the cause of action for
appointment of an arbitrator accrued to the respondent and
time began running from that day. Obviously, once time
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 105
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
has started running, any final rejection by the appellant by
its letter dated 10-11-2010 would not give any fresh start
to a limitation period which has already begun running,
following the mandate of Section 9 of the Limitation Act.
This being the case, the High Court was clearly in error
in stating that since the applications under Section 11
of the Arbitration Act were filed on 6-11-2013, they were
within the limitation period of three years starting from
10-11-2020. On this count, the applications under Section
11 of the Arbitration Act, themselves being hopelessly
time-barred, no arbitrator could have been appointed by
the High Court.”
(emphasis supplied)
59. Similarly, in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (supra), this Court after
applying the settled position of law held as follows:
“22. Applying the aforesaid law to the facts of the present
case, we find that the application under Section 11 was
filed within the limitation period prescribed under Article
137 of the Limitation Act. Nortel issued the notice of
arbitration vide letter dated 29-4-2020, which was rejected
by BSNL vide its reply dated 9-6-2020. The application
under Section 11 was filed before the High Court on 24-
7-2020 i.e. within the period of 3 years of rejection of the
request for appointment of the arbitrator.”
(emphasis supplied)
60. It’s time now to apply the dicta laid down in the aforesaid judgments
to the facts of the present case. The notice for invocation of arbitration
was issued by the petitioner to the respondent on 24.11.2022,
proposing the names of two learned arbitrators and calling upon
the respondent to either release the allegedly withheld payment or
nominate an arbitrator from their side within a period of 30 days from
the date of receipt of the notice. As per the record, the notice was
delivered to the respondent on 29.11.2022. The relevant extracts
from the said notice are extracted hereinbelow:
“14. Thus disputes arose between the parties, one
incorporated in a country other than India in relation to the
Franchise Agreement dt. 21.3.2013, which would attract
106 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Section 2(1)(f)(ii) of the A&C Act. Since every effort to
resolve it amicably failed, our client is invoking Sec 11(6)
read with Section 11(12)(a) of A & C Act before Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India to seek appointment of a sole
arbitrator in case M/s Aptech Ltd. is not heeding AACL
request in this behalf.
15. Without prejudice to your rights, our client suggests the
name of 2 persons, namely Sri. V. Giri, Sri. M L Verma,
Senior advocates practicing in the Hon’ble Supreme Court
subject to consent, or any Hon’ble former judges for enter
into reference with consent of parties to decide all the
disputes arising out of the Franchise Agreement dated
21.3.2013, between the parties, within the period as per
Section 29A of the Act.
16. In case of failure on your part to return the illegally
withheld money or if the above request for appointment
of a sole Arbitrator from the panel suggested or any other
name suggested from your side within 30 days of from
the receipt of this notice, our clients will be constrained
to file appropriate legal proceedings as stated in Para
14 of this notice for which M/s Aptech Ltd. will be fully
responsible for all costs, risks, responsibilities, expenses
and consequences thereof. Please note. Copy Retained.”
61. The respondent replied to the said notice on 05.04.2023. The relevant
parts from the aforesaid reply are extracted hereinbelow:
“5. My clients submit that the notice addressed by you
on behalf of your clients is defective, unjustified, without
any basis, documents, material and is contradictory and
inconsistent with the stand taken by your clients in the
mediation proceedings filed before the Hon’ble High Court.
6. My client states that your clients have misinterpreted the
clause of the Arbitration under the Franchise Agreement
dated 21.3.2013 i.e., the conciliation/mediation process and
are linking the same to the proceedings of mediation filed
before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court. My client states
that the mediation proceedings filed before the Hon’ble
Bombay High Court was filed under section 2(1)(c) of
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 107
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
the Commercial Court Act which is mandatory provision
before instituting the Commercial Suit. Therefore, my
clients therefore state that the invocation of arbitration
clause under the Franchise Agreement dated 21.3.2013
and your notice dated 24.11.2022 is illegal, invalid, non-
est and unjustified and is liable to be withdrawn forthwith.
7. My clients state that in view of the aforesaid position,
there is no cause of action for referring any dispute to the
Arbitration and your notice is defective, illegal and invalid.
Therefore, there is no question of my clients consenting to
the invocation of the arbitration clause and/or appointment
of an Arbitrator.
8. My clients state that despite having conveyed the above
should your client insists in initiating any legal proceedings,
the same shall be defended entirely at your client’s risk
as to costs and consequences. My clients reiterate that
nothing contained in your notice and not specifically dealt
with herein shall in any manner be treated as an admission
due to non traverse and in fact shall be treated as denial.”
62. A perusal of the above shows that the request for appointment of an
arbitrator was first made by the petitioner vide notice dated 24.11.2022
and a time of one month from the date of receipt of notice was given
to the respondent to comply with the said notice. The notice was
delivered to the respondent on 29.11.2022. Hence, the said period of
one month from the date of receipt came to an end on 28.12.2022.
Thus, it is only from this day that the clock of limitation for filing the
present petition would start to tick. The present petition was filed by
the petitioner on 19.04.2023, which is well within the time period of
3 years provided by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Thus,
the present petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 cannot be
said to be barred by limitation.
ii. Issue No. 2: Whether the court may refuse to make
a reference under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and
hopelessly time-barred?
63. As discussed above, the present petition filed by the petitioner is
not barred by limitation. Thus, the next question that falls for our
108 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
consideration is whether the claims sought to be arbitrated by the
petitioner are ex-facie barred by limitation, and if so, whether the
court may refuse to refer them to arbitration?
a. Jurisdiction versus Admissibility
64. There are two categories of issues that may be raised against an
application for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the
Act, 1996. The first category is of the issues pertaining to the power
and authority of the arbitrators to hear and decide a case and are
referred to as the “jurisdictional issues/objections”. Objections to
the competence of arbitrators to adjudicate a dispute, existence/
validity of arbitration agreement, absence of consent of the parties
to submit the disputes to arbitration, dispute falling out of the scope
of the arbitration agreement are some examples of jurisdictional or
maintainability issues.
65. The second category is of those issues which are related to the nature
of the claim and include challenges to procedural requirements, viz.
a mandatory requirement for pre-reference mediation; claim or a part
thereof being barred by limitation, etc. This category is referred to
as the “admissibility issues/objections”.
66. This Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (supra), explained
the difference between the aforesaid two category of objections and
held that the issue of limitation is essentially an admissibility issue
and is not a challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to decide
the claim. While placing reliance on decision of the Singapore Court
of Appeal in Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd. v. Kingdom
of Lesotho reported in (2019) 1 SLR 263, this Court explained the
“tribunal v. claim” test thus:
“43. Applying the “tribunal v. claim” test, a plea of statutory
time bar goes towards admissibility as it attacks the claim.
It makes no difference whether the applicable statute of
limitations is classified as substantive (extinguishing the
claim) or procedural (barring the remedy) in the private
international law sense.
44. The issue of limitation which concerns the “admissibility”
of the claim, must be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal either
as a preliminary issue, or at the final stage after evidence
is led by the parties.”
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 109
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
67. Although, limitation is an admissibility issue, yet it is the duty of the
courts to prima-facie examine and reject non-arbitrable or dead
claims, so as to protect the other party from being drawn into a
time-consuming and costly arbitration process.
68. In Mustiu and Boyd’s Commercial Arbitration (1982 Ed., pp. 436)
under the heading “Hopeless Claims” in Chapter 31 it is stated
thus in relation to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal adjudicating
commercial disputes:
“Two situations must be distinguished. The first, which is
very rare, exists when the claimant not only appreciates,
but will if pressed be prepared to acknowledge, that his
claim is ill-founded in law. In effect, he asserts that his
claim has commercial and moral merit; that if the law gives
him no remedy, there is a defect in the law; and that a
commercial arbitrator ought to award him something in
recognition of the true merits.
Here, we believe that there is undoubtedly jurisdiction to
interfere by way of injunction to prevent the respondent
from being harassed by a claim which can never lead to
valid award, for example in cases where claim is brought in
respect of the alleged arbitration agreement which does not
really exist, or which has ceased to exist. So also where the
dispute lies outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.
By parity of reasoning, the Court should be prepared to
intervene where the claimant and the respondent are at
one as to the absence of legal merits, so that it can be
said that there is no real dispute.
The respondent might also seek to protect himself by
recourse to the arbitrator. He cannot ask the arbitrator
to rule that there is no dispute, since this would be a
matter affecting his own jurisdiction. An alternative would
be to invite the arbitrator summarily to dismiss the claim.
It would appear safer, however, to leave the matter to
the court.”
69. The scope of this primary examination has been carefully laid down
by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia and Others v.
Durga Trading Corporation reported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 as follows:
110 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the
Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies
to court proceedings. Sub-Section (2) states that for the
purposes of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, arbitration
shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred
to in Section 21. Limitation law is procedural and normally
disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator to
decide guided by the facts found and the law applicable.
The court at the referral stage can interfere only when it
is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred and
dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. All other cases
should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for decision on
merits. Similar would be the position in case of disputed
“no-claim certificate” or defence on the plea of novation
and “accord and satisfaction”. As observed in Premium
Nafta Products Ltd. [Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Premium
Nafta Products Ltd., 2007 UKHL 40 : 2007 Bus LR 1719
(HL)], it is not to be expected that commercial men while
entering transactions inter se would knowingly create a
system which would require that the court should first
decide whether the contract should be rectified or avoided
or rescinded, as the case may be, and then if the contract
is held to be valid, it would require the arbitrator to resolve
the issues that have arisen.
xxx xxx xxx
154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may inerfere at
Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie
certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent, invalid
or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and
facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine
the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The restricted
and limited review is to check and protect parties from
being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably
“non-arbitrable” and to cut off the deadwood. The court by
default would refer the matter when contentions relating to
non-arbitrability are plainly arguable; when consideration
in summary proceedings would be insufficient and
inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party
opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 111
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is not the stage
for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review
so as to usurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but
to affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as
an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.”
(emphasis supplied)
70. The aforesaid decision in Vidya Drolia (supra) was relied upon and
reaffirmed in another decision of this Court in NTPC Ltd. v. SPML
Infra Ltd. reported in (2023) 9 SCC 385 wherein the “Eye of the
Needle” test was explained as follows:
“Eye of the needle
25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position
of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of the Courts under
Section 11(6) of the Act is very narrow and inheres two
inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence
and the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also
includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement
and the applicant’s privity to the said agreement. These
are matters which require a thorough examination by the
Referral Court. The secondary inquiry that may arise at the
reference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability
of the dispute.
26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal
is the preferred first authority to determine and decide all
questions of non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule,
and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject
claims which are manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable
[Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, para
154.4: (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549]. Explaining this position,
flowing from the principles laid down in Vidya Drolia [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021)
1 SCC (Civ) 549], this Court in a subsequent decision in
Nortel Networks [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd.,
(2021) 5 SCC 738 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352] held [BSNL
v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738,
para 45.1 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352] : (Nortel Networks
case [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5
SCC 738 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352], SCC p. 764, para 45)
112 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“45. … 45.1. … While exercising jurisdiction
under Section 11 as the judicial forum, the Court
may exercise the prima facie test to screen and
knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous, and
dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of the Courts
would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at
the referral stage. At the referral stage, the Court
can interfere “only” when it is “manifest” that the
claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there
is no subsisting dispute.”
27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability
of a claim is only prima facie. Referral Courts must not
undertake a full review of the contested facts; they must
only be confined to a primary first review [Vidya Drolia v.
Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 134 : (2021)
1 SCC (Civ) 549] and let facts speak for themselves. This
also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion
on arbitrability is bona fide or not. [Vidya Drolia v. Durga
Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ)
549] The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead to a
clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt
that the claim is non-arbitrable. [BSNL v. Nortel Networks
(India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738, para 47 : (2021) 3 SCC
(Civ) 352] On the other hand, even if there is the slightest
doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to arbitration [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, para
154.4 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] .
28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is
necessary and compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of
the Referral Court to protect the parties from being forced
to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-arbitrable
[Ibid.]. It has been termed as a legitimate interference by
Courts to refuse reference in order to prevent wastage
of public and private resources [Vidya Drolia v. Durga
Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1
SCC (Civ) 549]. Further, as noted in Vidya Drolia [Vidya
Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021)
1 SCC (Civ) 549], if this duty within the limited compass
is not exercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 113
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both,
arbitration and the Court [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading
Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ)
549]. Therefore, this Court or a High Court, as the case
may be, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6)
of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely
to deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at
the doors of the chosen arbitrator, as explained in DLF
Home Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd. [DLF
Home Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd., (2021)
16 SCC 743, paras 22, 26 : 2021 SCC OnLine SC 781,
paras 18, 20]”
(emphasis supplied)
71. In Geo Miller (supra) where the cause of action for bringing the
claim arose in 1983, this Court refused to appoint an arbitrator as
the application seeking appointment of arbitrator was filed much later
in 2003, that is after a delay of almost twenty years. The relevant
part of the said judgment is extracted hereinbelow:
“21. Applying the aforementioned principles to the present
case, we find ourselves in agreement with the finding of the
High Court that the appellant’s cause of action in respect of
Arbitration Applications Nos. 25/2003 and 27/2003, relating
to the work orders dated 7-10-1979 and 4-4-1980 arose
on 8-2-1983, which is when the final bill handed over to
the respondent became due. Mere correspondence of
the appellant by way of writing letters/reminders to the
respondent subsequent to this date would not extend the
time of limitation. Hence the maximum period during which
this Court could have allowed the appellant’s application
for appointment of an arbitrator is 3 years from the date
on which cause of action arose i.e. 8-2-1986. Similarly,
with respect to Arbitration Application No. 28/2003 relating
to the work order dated 3-5-1985, the respondent has
stated that final bill was handed over and became due on
10-8-1989. This has not been disputed by the appellant.
Hence the limitation period ended on 10-8-1992. Since
the appellant served notice for appointment of arbitrator
in 2002, and requested the appointment of an arbitrator
114 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
before a court only by the end of 2003, his claim is clearly
barred by limitation.”
(emphasis supplied)
72. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (supra), this Court while
observing that although the arbitration petition was not barred by
limitation, yet the cause of action for the underlying claims having
arisen much earlier, the claims were clearly barred by limitation on
the day notice for arbitration was invoked. Relevant paragraphs are
extracted hereinbelow:
“48. Applying the law to the facts of the present case, it
is clear that this is a case where the claims are ex facie
time-barred by over 5½ years, since Nortel did not take
any action whatsoever after the rejection of its claim by
BSNL on 4-8-2014. The notice of arbitration was invoked
on 29-4-2020. There is not even an averment either in the
notice of arbitration, or the petition filed under Section 11, or
before this Court, of any intervening facts which may have
occurred, which would extend the period of limitation falling
within Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act. Unless, there
is a pleaded case specifically adverting to the applicable
section, and how it extends the limitation from the date
on which the cause of action originally arose, there can
be no basis to save the time of limitation.
49. The present case is a case of deadwood/no subsisting
dispute since the cause of action arose on 4-8-2014, when
the claims made by Nortel were rejected by BSNL. The
respondent has not stated any event which would extend
the period of limitation, which commenced as per Article
55 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act (which provides
the limitation for cases pertaining to breach of contract)
immediately after the rejection of the final bill by making
deductions.
50. In the notice invoking arbitration dated 29-4-2020, it
has been averred that:
“Various communications have been exchanged
between the petitioner and the respondents ever
since and a dispute has arisen between the petitioner
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 115
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
and the respondents, regarding non-payment of the
amounts due under the tender document.”
51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration
would not get extended by mere exchange of letters, [S.S.
Rathore v. State of M.P., (1989) 4 SCC 582 : 1990 SCC
(L&S) 50; Union of India v. Har Dayal, (2010) 1 SCC 394;
CLP (India) (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.,
(2020) 5 SCC 185] or mere settlement discussions, where
a final bill is rejected by making deductions or otherwise.
Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the
time taken on account of settlement discussions. Section
9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that:“where once the
time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability
to institute a suit or make an application stops it.” There
must be a clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the
“particular dispute” [ Section 21 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996.] (including claims/amounts) which
must be received by the other party within a period of 3
years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the
time bar would prevail.
52. In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was
issued 5½ years after rejection of the claims on 4-8-2014.
Consequently, the notice invoking arbitration is ex facie
time-barred, and the disputes between the parties cannot
be referred to arbitration in the facts of this case.”
(emphasis supplied)
73. This Court, in M/s B and T AG (supra), to which two of us, the Chief
Justice, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice J.B. Pardiwala, were
members of the Bench, had the occasion to ascertain in the facts
of the said case whether an application for appointment of arbitrator
under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 was barred by limitation. The
facts of the said case were that disputes had arisen between the
parties in relation to the alleged wrongful encashment of warranty
bond by the respondent therein vide its letter dated 16.02.2016. Even
after the amount got credited in the bank account of the respondent,
the parties continued to engage in bilateral discussions. It was the
case of the petitioner therein that the ‘breaking point’ was reached
sometime in September, 2019 and not in 2016 as negotiations had
116 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
continued to take place between the parties. This Court rejected the
contention of the petitioner and held that the encashment of bank
guarantee was a positive action on part of the respondent which had
crystallised the right of the petitioner to seek reference of the dispute
to arbitration and mere writing of letters would not extend the cause
of action. It was held that the notice for invoking arbitration having
been issued almost six years after the cause of action for raising the
claims had arisen, the claims were ex-facie dead and time-barred
and hence dismissed the application. Relevant extracts from the
judgment are as follows:
“65. On a conspectus of all the aforesaid decisions what
is discernible is that there is a fine distinction between the
plea that the claims raised are barred by limitation and the
plea that the application for appointment of an arbitrator
is barred by limitation.
xxx xxx xxx
76. At the cost of repetition, we state that when the bank
guarantee came to be encashed in the year 2016 and
the requisite amount stood transferred to the Government
account that was the end of the matter. This “Breaking
Point” should be treated as the date at which the cause
of action arose for the purpose of limitation.
77. Negotiations may continue even for a period of ten
years or twenty years after the cause of action had arisen.
Mere negotiations will not postpone the “cause of action” for
the purpose of limitation. The Legislature has prescribed a
limit of three years for the enforcement of a claim and this
statutory time period cannot be defeated on the ground
that the parties were negotiating.
xxx xxx xxx
80. The case on hand is clearly and undoubtedly, one of
a hopelessly barred claim, as the petitioner by its conduct
slept over its right for more than five years. Statutory
arbitrations stand apart.”
(emphasis supplied)
74. The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent has strongly
relied on the judgment in M/s B and T AG (supra) to argue that
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 117
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
the facts of the present case are squarely covered by the dicta laid
down in the said judgment. However, we are of the view that the
said judgment is of no avail to the respondent.
75. The respondent, relying upon the legal notice dated 26.08.2021
issued by the petitioner, submitted that the cause of action arose on
01.11.2017. The relevant part of the said notice is extracted here:
“10. Our client is entitled to receive 90% of the amount
certified by the Embassy in Kabul. While reserving our rights
without prejudice and subject to settlement of accounts
illegally withheld, this notice is issued calling upon you to
pay Rs. 73,53,000/- with interest compounded monthly
@18% w.e.f. 1st November 2017 within 15 days of from the
receipt of this notice, under intimation to us, failing which
our client has given instructions to file appropriate legal
proceedings before competent courts in India including
a suit for settlement of accounts for recovery of money
and also by way of damages or otherwise for, breach of
trust, breach of contract. In default, Aptech will be fully
responsible for all costs, risks, responsibilities, expenses
and consequences thereof.”
76. From the email communications placed on record, it appears that
due to the pre-existing disputes between the parties in relation to
the franchise agreements, the respondent sent a demand notice to
the petitioner seeking payment of royalty and renewal fees from the
petitioner. It appears that in reply to the said notice dated 23.03.2018,
the petitioner raised the issue of payment of dues relating to the
ICCR project. Some more emails were exchanged between the
parties on the issue however it can be seen that vide email dated
28.03.2018, the respondent clearly showed unwillingness to continue
further discussions regarding payments related to the ICCR project.
Thus, it can be said that the rights of the petitioner to bring a claim
against the respondent were crystallised on 28.03.2018 and hence
the cause of action for invocation of arbitration can also said to
have arisen on this date. This position has also been admitted in
the Written Submission dated 05.02.2024 wherein the petitioner has
submitted as follows:
“4. The limitation for claiming the due amount would expire
on 27.03.2021….”
118 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
b. When does the Cause of Action arise?
77. We are not impressed with the submission canvassed on behalf of
the respondent that the cause of action for raising the claims arose
on 01.11.2017 and thus the limitation period for invoking arbitration
should commence from the said date. The petitioner has alleged that
the respondent received the payment for the course from the ICCR on
03.10.2017. However, the perusal of the communication exchanged
between the parties indicates that it is only on 28.03.2018 that the
right of the petitioner to bring a claim against the respondent could
be said to have been crystallised. The position of law is settled that
mere failure to pay may not give rise to a cause of action. However,
once the applicant has asserted its claim and the respondent has
either denied such claim or failed to reply to it, the cause of action
will arise after such denial or failure.
78. In M/s B and T AG (supra) three principles of law came to be
enunciated by this Court regarding the manner in which the point in
time when the cause of action arose may be determined. First, that
the right to receive the payment ordinarily begins upon completion
of the work. Secondly, a dispute arises only when there is a claim by
one side and its denial/repudiation by the other and thirdly, the accrual
of cause of action cannot be indefinitely postponed by repeatedly
writing letters or sending reminders. It was further emphasised by
this Court that it was important to find out the “breaking point” at
which any reasonable party would have abandoned the efforts at
arriving at a settlement and contemplated referral of the dispute to
arbitration. Such breaking point would then become the date on which
the cause of action could be said to have commenced.
79. This Court in Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi v. Delhi Development
Authority reported in (1988) 2 SCC 338 held as follows:
“4. Therefore, in order to be entitled to order of reference
under Section 20, it is necessary that there should be an
arbitration agreement and secondly, difference must arise
to which this agreement applied. In this case, there is no
dispute that there was an arbitration agreement. There has
been an assertion of claim by the appellant and silence
as well as refusal in respect of the same by respondent.
Therefore, a dispute has arisen regarding non-payment
of the alleged dues of the appellant. The question is for
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 119
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
the present case when did such dispute arise. The High
Court proceeded on the basis that the work was completed
in 1980 and therefore, the appellant became entitled
to the payment from that date and the cause of action
under Article 137 arose from that date. But in order to be
entitled to ask for a reference under Section 20 of the Act
there must not only be an entitlement to money but there
must be a difference or dispute must arise. It is true that
on completion of the work a right to get payment would
normally arise but where the final bills as in this case
have not been prepared as appears from the record and
when the assertion of the claim was made on February
28, 1983 and there was non-payment, the cause of action
arose from that date, that is to say, February 28, 1983. It
is also true that a party cannot postpone the accrual of
cause of action by writing reminders or sending reminders
but where the bill had not been finally prepared, the claim
made by a claimant is the accrual of the cause of action.
A dispute arises where there is a claim and a denial
and repudiation of the claim. The existence of dispute is
essential for appointment of an arbitrator under Section
8 or a reference under Section 20 of the Act. See Law of
Arbitration by R.S. Bachawat, first edition, page 354. There
should be dispute and there can only be a dispute when a
claim is asserted by one party and denied by the other on
whatever grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not
lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. Dispute
entails a positive element and assertion of denying, not
merely inaction to accede to a claim or a request. Whether
in a particular case a dispute has arisen or not has to be
found out from the facts and circumstances of the case.”
(emphasis supplied)
80. In Geo Miller (supra), this Court held thus:
“28. Having perused through the relevant precedents, we
agree that on a certain set of facts and circumstances, the
period during which the parties were bona fide negotiating
towards an amicable settlement may be excluded for the
purpose of computing the period of limitation for reference
120 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to arbitration under the 1996 Act. However, in such cases
the entire negotiation history between the parties must be
specifically pleaded and placed on the record. The Court
upon careful consideration of such history must find out
what was the “breaking point” at which any reasonable
party would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a
settlement and contemplated referral of the dispute for
arbitration. This “breaking point” would then be treated
as the date on which the cause of action arises, for the
purpose of limitation. The threshold for determining when
such a point arises will be lower in the case of commercial
disputes, where the party’s primary interest is in securing
the payment due to them, than in family disputes where
it may be said that the parties have a greater stake in
settling the dispute amicably, and therefore delaying formal
adjudication of the claim.
29. Moreover, in a commercial dispute, while mere failure
to pay may not give rise to a cause of action, once the
applicant has asserted their claim and the respondent fails
to respond to such claim, such failure will be treated as a
denial of the applicant’s claim giving rise to a dispute, and
therefore the cause of action for reference to arbitration. It
does not lie to the applicant to plead that it waited for an
unreasonably long period to refer the dispute to arbitration
merely on account of the respondent’s failure to settle their
claim and because they were writing representations and
reminders to the respondent in the meanwhile.”
(emphasis supplied)
81. The petitioner completed the course sometime in April and a letter to this
effect was issued on 30.07.2017 by the EOI, Kabul. Allegedly, the ICCR
made payment to the respondent on 03.10.2017. However, the right
of the petitioner to raise the claim could only be said to have accrued
after the petitioner made a positive assertion in March, 2018 which
was denied by the respondent vide email dated 28.03.2018. Another
reminder through email was given by the petitioner on 29.12.2018,
however, mere giving reminders and sending of letters would not
extend the cause of action any further from 28.03.2018 on which date
the rights of the petitioner could be said to have been crystallised.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 121
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
82. Thus, in ordinary circumstances, the limitation period available
to the petitioner for raising a claim would have come to an end
after an expiry of three years, that is, on 27.03.2021. However,
in March 2020, the entire world was taken under the grip of the
deadly Covid-19 pandemic bringing everyday life and commercial
activity to a complete halt across the globe. Taking cognisance
of this unfortunate turn of events, this Court vide order dated
23.03.2020 passed in Suo Motu Civil Writ Petition No. 03/2020
directed the period commencing from 15.03.2020 to be excluded
for the purposes of computation of limitation. The said extension of
limitation was extended from time to time by this Court in view of
the continuing pandemic. As a result, the period from 15.03.2020
to 28.02.2022 was finally determined to be excluded for the
computation of limitation. It was provided that the balance period
of limitation as available on 15.03.2020 would become available
from 01.03.2022. Operative part of the order dated 10.01.2022 is
extracted hereinbelow:
“5. Taking into consideration the arguments advanced by
learned counsel and the impact of the surge of the virus
on public health and adversities faced by litigants in the
prevailing conditions, we deem it appropriate to dispose
of the M.A. No. 21 of 2022 with the following directions:
I. The order dated 23.03.2020 is restored and in
continuation of the subsequent orders dated
08.03.2021, 27.04.2021 and 23.09.2021, it is directed
that the period from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 shall
stand excluded for the purposes of limitation as may
be prescribed under any general or special laws in
respect of all judicial or quasi judicial proceedings.
II. Consequently, the balance period of limitation
remaining as on 03.10.2021, if any, shall become
available with effect from 01.03.2022.
III. In cases where the limitation would have expired
during the period between 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022,
notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation
remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period
of 90 days from 01.03.2022. In the event the actual
balance period of limitation remaining, with effect
122 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
from 01.03.2022 is greater than 90 days, that longer
period shall apply.
IV. It is further clarified that the period from 15.03.2020 till
28.02.2022 shall also stand excluded in computing the
periods prescribed under Sections 23 (4) and 29A of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A
of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisos (b)
and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, 1881 and any other laws, which prescribe
period(s) of limitation for instituting proceedings, outer
limits (within which the court or tribunal can condone
delay) and termination of proceedings.”
83. The operation and effect of the aforesaid order was considered and
explained by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Prakash Corporates
v. Dee Vee Projects Ltd., reported in (2022) 5 SCC 112 as follows:
“28. As regards the operation and effect of the orders
passed by this Court in SMWP No. 3 of 2020, noticeable
it is that even though in the initial order dated 23-3-2020
[Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re, (2020) 19
SCC 10 : (2021) 3 SCC (Cri) 801], this Court provided that
the period of limitation in all the proceedings, irrespective
of that prescribed under general or special laws, whether
condonable or not, shall stand extended w.e.f. 15-3-2020
but, while concluding the matter on 23-9-2021 [Cognizance
for Extension of Limitation, In re, (2021) 18 SCC 250 : 2021
SCC OnLine SC 947], this Court specifically provided for
exclusion of the period from 15-3-2020 till 2-10-2021. A
look at the scheme of the Limitation Act, 1963 makes it
clear that while extension of prescribed period in relation
to an appeal or certain applications has been envisaged
under Section 5, the exclusion of time has been provided
in the provisions like Sections 12 to 15 thereof. When
a particular period is to be excluded in relation to any
suit or proceeding, essentially the reason is that such
a period is accepted by law to be the one not referable
to any indolence on the part of the litigant, but being
relatable to either the force of circumstances or other
requirements of law (like that of mandatory two months’
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 123
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
notice for a suit against the Government [Vide Section 15
of the Limitation Act, 1963.]). The excluded period, as a
necessary consequence, results in enlargement of time,
over and above the period prescribed.”
(emphasis supplied)
84. The effect of the above-referred order of this Court in the facts of
the present case is that the balance limitation left on 15.03.2020
would become available w.e.f. 01.03.2022. The balance period of
limitation remaining on 15.03.2020 can be calculated by computing
the number of days between 15.03.2020 and 27.03.2021, which
is the day when the limitation period would have come to an end
under ordinary circumstances. The balance period thus comes to 1
year 13 days. This period of 1 year 13 days becomes available to
the petitioner from 01.03.2022, thereby meaning that the limitation
period available to the petitioner for invoking arbitration proceedings
would have come to an end on 13.03.2023.
c. When is Arbitration deemed to have commenced?
85. Section 21 of the Act, 1996 provides that the arbitral proceedings in
relation to a dispute commence when a notice invoking arbitration
is sent by the claimant to the other party.
“21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.—Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings
in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on
which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration
is received by the respondent.”
86. In Milkfood Ltd. v. GMC Ice Cream (P) Ltd. reported in (2004) 7
SCC 288, it was observed thus:
“26. The commencement of an arbitration proceeding for
the purpose of applicability of the provisions of the Indian
Limitation Act is of great significance. Even Section 43(1)
of the 1996 Act provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall
apply to the arbitration as it applies to proceedings in court.
Sub-section (2) thereof provides that for the purpose of the
said section and the Limitation Act, 1963, an arbitration
shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred
to in Section 21.
124 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
27. Article 21 of the Model Law which was modelled on
Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules had been
adopted for the purpose of drafting Section 21 of the
1996 Act. Section 3 of the 1996 Act provides for as to
when a request can be said to have been received by the
respondent. Thus, whether for the purpose of applying the
provisions of Chapter II of the 1940 Act or for the purpose
of Section 21 of the 1996 Act, what is necessary is to
issue/serve a request/notice to the respondent indicating
that the claimant seeks arbitration of the dispute.
xxx xxx xxx
29. For the purpose of the Limitation Act an arbitration
is deemed to have commenced when one party to the
arbitration agreement serves on the other a notice requiring
the appointment of an arbitrator. This indeed is relatable
to the other purposes also, as, for example, see Section
29(2) of (English) Arbitration Act, 1950.
xxx xxx xxx
49. Section 21 of the 1996 Act, as noticed hereinbefore,
provides as to when the arbitral proceedings would be
deemed to have commenced. Section 21 although may be
construed to be laying down a provision for the purpose
of the said Act but the same must be given its full effect
having regard to the fact that the repeal and saving clause
is also contained therein. Section 21 of the Act must,
therefore, be construed having regard to Section 85(2)(a)
of the 1996 Act. Once it is so construed, indisputably the
service of notice and/or issuance of request for appointment
of an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement must
be held to be determinative of the commencement of the
arbitral proceeding.”
(emphasis supplied)
87. Similarly, in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (supra), it was held
by this Court thus:
“51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of
arbitration would not get extended by mere exchange
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 125
M/S Arif Azim Co. Ltd. v. M/S Aptech Ltd.
of letters, [S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P., (1989) 4 SCC
582 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 50; Union of India v. Har Dayal,
(2010) 1 SCC 394; CLP (India) (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat
Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 185] or mere
settlement discussions, where a final bill is rejected by
making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of the
Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account
of settlement discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation
Act makes it clear that:“where once the time has begun
to run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a
suit or make an application stops it.” There must be a
clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the “particular
dispute” [ Section 21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996.] (including claims/amounts) which must be
received by the other party within a period of 3 years
from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time
bar would prevail.”
(emphasis supplied)
88. In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was received by
the respondent on 29.11.2022, which is within the three-year period
from the date on which the cause of action for the claim had arisen.
Thus, it cannot be said that the claims sought to be raised by the
petitioner are ex-facie time-barred or dead claims on the date of the
commencement of arbitration.
89. Thus, from an exhaustive analysis of the position of law on the issues,
we are of the view that while considering the issue of limitation in
relation to a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, the courts
should satisfy themselves on two aspects by employing a two-pronged
test – first, whether the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996
is barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims sought to be
arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims and are thus barred by limitation
on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings. If either
of these issues are answered against the party seeking referral of
disputes to arbitration, the court may refuse to appoint an arbitral
tribunal.
E. CONCLUSION
90. The present arbitration petition having been filed within a period
of three years from the date when the respondent failed to comply
126 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
with the notice of invocation of arbitration issued by the petitioner
is not hit by limitation.
91. The notice for invocation of arbitration having been issued by the
petitioner within a period of three years from the date of accrual of
cause of action, the claims cannot be said to be ex-facie dead or time-
barred on the date of commencement of the arbitration proceedings.
92. In view of the aforesaid, the present petition is allowed. We appoint
Shri Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Former Judge of the Supreme
Court of India, to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator
including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties.
93. All other rights and contentions are kept open for the parties to raise
before the Arbitrator.
94. Before we part with the matter, we would like to mention that this
Court while dealing with similar issues in many other matters has
observed that the applicability of Section 137 to applications under
Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is a result of legislative vacuum as
there is no statutory prescription regarding the time limit. We would
again like to reiterate that the period of three years is an unduly
long period for filing an application under Section 11 of the Act, 1996
and goes against the very spirit of the Act, 1996 which provides for
expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time-bound
manner. Various amendments to the Act, 1996 have been made over
the years so as to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted
and concluded expeditiously. We are of the considered opinion that
the Parliament should consider bringing an amendment to the Act,
1996 prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a party
may move the court for making an application for appointment of
arbitrators under Section 11 of the Act, 1996. The Petition stands
disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
95. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.
1. What are the legal implications of a promotional trailer, popularly
known as a ‘promo’, or a teaser that is circulated before the release
of a movie? Does it create any contractual relationship or obligations
akin to it? Is it an unfair trade practice if the contents of the promotional
trailer are not shown in the movie? These questions have arisen
in the context of a consumer dispute wherein the consumer courts
have allowed the complaint alleging deficiency of service based on
a ‘contractual obligation’ and ‘unfair trade practice’. For the reasons
to follow, we have held that promotional trailers are unilateral and
do not qualify as offers eliciting acceptance, and as such they do
not transform into promises, much less agreements enforceable by
law. We have also held that the facts do not indicate adoption of
146 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
Before we delve into the analysis to draw our conclusions, the short
facts necessary for the case are as follows.
2. The appellant is a known film producer. It produced a film called
‘Fan’ in the year 2016. Before the release of the film, the appellant
circulated a promotional trailer, both on television and online, which
contained a song in the form of a video.
2.1 The respondent no. 1 (‘complainant’), a teacher in a school
in Aurangabad, states that having watched the promotional
trailer of the film, she decided to go to watch the movie on
the silver screen with her family. However, she found that the
movie did not contain the song, even though the song was
widely circulated for promoting and publicising the movie.
She filed a consumer complaint before the District Consumer
Redressal Forum wherein she has stated that she decided to
watch the movie after watching the song in the promotional
trailer, with the expectation of watching the song in the theatre.
However, to her disappointment, she found that the song was
not played in the movie. She alleges that due to this, she felt
cheated and deceived by the appellants and has undergone
mental agony. In view of the above, she claimed Rs. 60,550
as damages.
3. In a short order dated 29.04.2016, the District Consumer Redressal
Forum dismissed the complaint on the ground that there is no
relationship of consumer and service provider.
3.1 Against the above order, the complainant filed an appeal before
the State Commission, which was allowed by order dated
22.09.2017. The State Commission held that entertainment
services are covered under the definition of ‘service’ and the
appellant is a service provider. Apart from holding that there
is deficiency in service, the State Commission held that the
appellant has engaged in an unfair trade practice as the song
in the promotional trailer was widely circulated but not shown
in the film. Under these circumstances, the State Commission
awarded Rs. 10,000 as compensation for mental harassment
and Rs. 5,000 as cost to the complainant.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 147
Yash Raj Films Private Limited v. Afreen Fatima Zaidi & Anr.
3.2 The appellant carried the matter to the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission1. By the order impugned,2 the
NCDRC held that a consumer would feel deceived if a song
that is shown in the promotional trailer is not played in the film,
thereby amounting to an unfair trade practice. Further, there is
deficiency of service as playing the song in the trailer leads to
an implied promise that it will be played in the film. In its own
words, the NCDRC held as follows:
“7. When the producer of a movie shows the promos of
the said movie on TV Channels, etc. and such promos
include a song, any person watching the promo would
be justified in believing that the movie would contain the
song shown in the said promos, unless the promo itself
contains a disclaimer that the song will not be a part of the
movie. If a person likes the song shown in the promo and
based upon such liking decides to visit a cinema hall for
watching the said movie for a consideration, he is bound
to feel deceived, disappointed and dejected if the song
shown in the promo is not found in the film. The practice of
including a song in the promo of a film shown widely on TV
Channels but excluding the said song while exhibiting the
movie, in my opinion, constitutes an unfair trade practice.
The obvious purpose behind such an unfair trade practice
is to draw the potential viewers to the cinema hall by luring
them with the song which forms part of the promo and
thereby making gain at the cost of the viewer if the song
does not form part of the movie for which consideration
is paid by the viewer. The exclusion of the song from the
movie will also constitute a deficiency, as defined in Section
2(1)(g) of the C.P. Act, if the song is impliedly promised,
but is later omitted while exhibiting the movie.”
4. Before we proceed to delineating and applying the test for ‘deficiency
of service’ and ‘unfair trade practice’ under the Consumer Protection
Act, 19863, it is necessary to set out the context in which a promotional

3 Hereinafter ‘the Act’.
148 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
trailer would or would not create a contractual relationship or any
other right or liability between the producer and the consumer.
5. A promotional trailer is an advertisement for a film. It is a settled position
of law that commercial speech, which includes advertisements, is
protected through freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the
Constitution, subject to the reasonable restrictions in Article 19(2).4
It is also a settled position that commercial speech that is deceptive,
unfair, misleading, and untruthful is excluded from such constitutional
protection and can be regulated and prohibited by the State.5 Subject
to these restrictions, the producer/ advertiser has the freedom to
creatively and artistically promote his goods and services.
6. Information dissemination is one of the primary purposes of advertising:
an advertisement informs existing and potential consumers about the
presence and availability of certain goods and services in the market,
their features and qualities, and their uniqueness and comparability
with market competitors and substitutes. However, that is not the
only purpose of an advertisement. An advertisement is not only
informational but also a means of creative and artistic expression.
It can allure, entice, capture the attention, and pique the interest of
consumers through features that may not directly relate to information
about the product or service. Advertisements build brand loyalty
and reputation, and promote an image and ethos of not only the
product being advertised but also the manufacturer/ service provider.
Advertisements contain unique taglines, jingles, visuals, etc. that are
intended to grab the attention of the viewer and become associated
and synonymous with the product or service itself.
7. A song, dialogue, or a short visual in a promotional trailer may be
seen in the context of the multifarious uses of advertisements. These
could be used to popularise or to create a buzz about the release
of the film, rather than to purely represent information about the
contents of the film. Viewers could associate these with the film and
may be interested or encouraged to watch the film. However, the
kind of right or liability a promotional trailer creates would entirely

[2024] 5 S.C.R. 149
Yash Raj Films Private Limited v. Afreen Fatima Zaidi & Anr.
depend on the civil and statutory legal regime. The complainant
has invoked the jurisdiction of the consumer court and therefore, it
is necessary to analyse the issues in view of the provisions of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
8. The Consumer Protection Act has been enacted to protect the
interests of consumers and for that purpose, to establish authorities
for the settlement of consumer disputes. A ‘consumer’ has been
defined in Section 2(1)(d) as a consumer of goods or services. A
consumer of goods is one who buys any goods, and a consumer of a
service is one who hires or avails of any service, for a consideration,
except when such goods or services are for a commercial purpose.6
A consumer can file a ‘complaint’, which is defined in Section 2(1)
(c) of the Act,7 alleging inter alia ‘deficiency in service’ and ‘unfair
trade practice’.
9. Deficiency of Service: In this context, the definition of ‘deficiency’
and ‘service’ are important. The term ‘service has been defined in
Section 2(1)(o) of the Act as follows:
“2. Definitions.—(1) In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,—
6 Section 2(1)(d) of the Act defines ‘consumer’ as follows’:
“2. Definitions.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—
(d) “consumer” means any person who,—
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised, or
under any system of deferred payment, when such use is made with the approval of such person, but
does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and
partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services
other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly
paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of
with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person who avails of such services
for any commercial purpose”
7 The relevant portion of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act defining ‘complaint’ is as follows’:
“(c) “complaint” means any allegation in writing made by a complainant that—
(i) an unfair trade practice or a restrictive trade practice has been adopted by any trader or service
provider;
***
(iii) the services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or availed of by him suffer from deficiency in
any respect;
***
with a view to obtaining any relief provided by or under this Act;”
150 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(o) “service” means service of any description which is
made available to potential users and includes, but not
limited to, the provision of facilities in connection with
banking, financing insurance, transport, processing,
supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or
both, housing construction, entertainment, amusement
or the purveying of news or other information, but does
not include the rendering of any service free of charge or
under a contract of personal service;”
There is no doubt about the fact that any person watching a movie
after remitting the necessary consideration becomes a consumer of
service. The service in this case is that of entertainment.
10. The question for our consideration is whether there is any ‘deficiency’
in the provision of the entertainment service that the consumer
has availed by paying the consideration through the purchase of
a ticket. The complainant alleges that there is ‘deficiency’ in the
service because what was shown in the film was not as per what
was promised. Now, the definition of ‘deficiency’ becomes relevant
and it is defined in Section 2(1)(g) of the Act as follows:
“2. Definitions.—(1) In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,—
(g) “deficiency” means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming
or inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of
performance which is required to be maintained by or
under any law for the time being in force or has been
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of
a contract or otherwise in relation to any service;”
11. As per the definition, there is deficiency when there is a fault,
imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature, and
manner of performance that is required to be maintained either in
terms of a law or in terms of a contract.8 To appreciate the allegation of
deficiency, it is necessary to refer to certain portions of the complaint:
“3. The Complainant states that, her children are big fans
of Shahrukh Khan and after watching the promos of the
8 Arulmighu Dhandayudhapaniswamy Thirukoil, Palani, Tamil Nadu v. Deptt. of Post Offices [2011] 10
SCR 43 : (2011) 13 SCC 220, para 18.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 151
Yash Raj Films Private Limited v. Afreen Fatima Zaidi & Anr.
song ‘Jabra Fan’ they decided to go to the movie ‘Fan’
to watch the song ‘Jabra Fan’ on silver screen. She had
given 2 option (1) Jungle Book and the second one was
‘Fan’ to both the children namely Nabeel and Flora. Out
of two option they preferred the later one because of song
‘Jabra Fan’ to enjoy on celluloid.
4. The Complainant states that, she accordingly convinced
her mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister and brother-in-law
for the movie by saying that, the film is looking great
and the song ‘Jabra Fan’ which is now become jingle,
is also there for the entertainment which will feel great
on the silver screen. She bought 7 Tickets of first day
first show on 15.04.2016, show time 6.10 p.m. Friday of
PVR Cinema of the row G-4 to G-10 of Rs. 150/- each
which cost her Rs. 1050/. The copy of all the Tickets are
dated 15.04.2016 are annexed herewith and marked as
Annexure ‘A’.
***
7. The Complainant states that, as the song was not
shown in the entire movies the family members and
in started teasing her that, why she planned for such
a movie which is not having a single song and a song
‘Jabra Fan’ which become anthem is shown in promos
of the film. She has gone through mental agony because
of Respondents act.”
It is evident from the above that the deficiency alleged in the complaint
arises out of the complainant’s own expectation that the song would
be a part of the movie. It is assumed that there is deficiency of
service as the movie did not contain the song.
12. The fallacy in this argument is in assuming that a promotional trailer
is an offer or a promise. It is under this misplaced assumption that
the complainant has assumed that the subsequent formation of a
contract to watch the movie is not in compliance with the promise
allegedly made through the promotional trailer. We will explain this
in terms of the law of contracts.
13. The essential element of an ‘offer’ or ‘proposal’ for the formation
of a contract has not been satisfied in the present case. A person
152 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
makes an offer or ‘proposal’ when he signifies his willingness to do
something with a view to obtain the assent of another person.9 When
the other person signifies his assent, the proposal gets accepted
and becomes a ‘promise’.10 A proposal is therefore a prerequisite to
a ‘promise’ and a ‘contract’.11
14. A promotional trailer is unilateral. It is only meant to encourage a
viewer to purchase the ticket to the movie, which is an independent
transaction and contract from the promotional trailer. A promotional
trailer by itself is not an offer and neither intends to nor can create a
contractual relationship.12 Since the promotional trailer is not an offer,
there is no possibility of it becoming a promise. Therefore, there is no
offer, much less a contract, between the appellant and the complainant
to the effect that the song contained in the trailer would be played
in the movie and if not played, it will amount to deficiency in the
service. The transaction of service is only to enable the complainant
to watch the movie upon the payment of consideration in the form
of purchase of the movie ticket. This transaction is unconnected to
the promotional trailer, which by itself does not create any kind of
right of claim with respect to the content of the movie.
15. Unfair Trade Practice: While we have held that no contract is formed
on the basis of the promotional trailer and as such, there is no
deficiency of service, there is a further question for our consideration,
i.e., whether it is an ‘unfair trade practice’ giving rise to a cause of
action. If it is found to be an unfair trade practice, the Act provides
for compensation and other remedies.
9 Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines ‘proposal’ as follows:
“2. Interpretation-clause.—In this Act the following words and expressions are used in the following
senses, unless a contrary intention appears from the context:—
(a) When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with
a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal;”
10 Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines ‘promise’ as follows:
“(b) When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to
be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise;”
11 Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines ‘contract as follows:
“(h) An agreement enforceable by law is a contract;”
‘Agreement’ has been defined in Section 2(e) as follows:
“(e) Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement;”
12 It is well-established in contractual jurisprudence that an advertisement generally does not constitute an
offer and is merely an ‘invitation to offer’ or ‘invitation to treat’. See Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol 22
(5th edn, LexisNexis 2012), para 240; Pollock and Mulla, The Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts,
vol I (14th edn, LexisNexis 2013), p. 42.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 153
Yash Raj Films Private Limited v. Afreen Fatima Zaidi & Anr.
16. The term ‘unfair trade practice’ is defined in Section 2(1)(r) of the
Act and the relevant portions are as follows:
“2. Definitions.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise
requires,—
(r) “unfair trade practice” means a trade practice which, for the
purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods
or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method
or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following
practices, namely:—
(1) the practice of making any statement, whether orally or in
writing or by visible representation which,—
***
(ii) falsely represents that the services are of a particular
standard, quality or grade;
***
(iv) represents that the goods or services have sponsorship,
approval, performance, characteristics, accessories, uses or
benefits which such goods or services do not have;”
17. In various decisions,13 this Court has held that a false statement that
misleads the buyer is essential for an ‘unfair trade practice’.14 A false
representation is one that is false in substance and in fact, and the
test by which the representation must be judged is to see whether
the discrepancy between the represented fact and the actual fact
would be considered material by a reasonable person.15 Further,
“statements of the nature which are wilfully made knowingly false,
or made recklessly without honest belief in its truth, and made with

a false or misleading representation.”16 Therefore, only substantive
and material discrepancies are covered under ‘unfair trade practice’.
18. The ingredients of ‘unfair trade practice’ under Section 2(1)(r)(1)
are not made out in this case. The promotional trailer does not fall
under any of the instances of “unfair method or unfair and deceptive
practice” contained in clause (1) of Section 2(1)(r) that pertains to
unfair trade practice in the promotion of goods and services. Nor
does it make any false statement or intend to mislead the viewers.
Furthermore, the burden is on the complainant to produce cogent
evidence that proves unfair trade practice17 but nothing has been
brought on record in the present case to show the same. Therefore,
no case for unfair trade practice is made out in the present case.
19. There is another important distinction that we must bear in mind, i.e.,
the judicial precedents on this point do not relate to transactions of
service relating to art. Services involving art necessarily involve the
freedom and discretion of the service provider in their presentation.
This is necessary and compelling by the very nature of such services.
The variations are substantial, and rightly so. Therefore, the standard
by which a court of law judges the representation, followed by the
service, must be different and must account for the creative element
involved in such transactions.
20. In view of the above reasons and conclusions, we set aside the
findings of the impugned order that there is deficiency of service
and unfair trade practice, and allow the present appeal.
21. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.

v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
(Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009)
30 April 2024
[Surya Kant and K.V. Viswanathan,* JJ.]","A claim for 35.08 crores was filed by the insured after the ‘20 Hi Cold
Rolling Mill’ was totally destroyed due to fire. Since running of the
company was important, the Insured got a new 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill
installed in its unit and commenced production. Admittedly, based
on the interim report of the surveyors, a sum of Rs.4,92,80,905/-
was released in favour of the Insured by NIACL-insurer. Thereafter,
the Insured gave consent for receiving Rs.20.95 Crores as net
adjusted loss. However, the NIACL computed depreciation at 60%
and settled the claim on 03.01.2003 stating the loss amount as
Rs.7.88 Crores. The issues arising for consideration are as follows:
(i) Was the Reinstatement Value Clause part of the policy; (ii)
Was NIACL justified in computing loss on depreciation basis and
fixing depreciation at 60%; (iii) Is the Insured justified in claiming
reinstatement value by placing reliance on the judgment in Oswal
Plastic Industries.
","Insurance – Reinstatement value clause – Whether the
memorandum consisting of the Reinstatement Value Clause
was a part of the policy – The Insured contended that the
memorandum containing the Reinstatement Value Clause was
not part of the policy:
Held: The contention of the insured rejected – This is for the reason
that before the NCDRC in the written statement filed by the NIACL it
was specifically pleaded that copy of the fire policy was not attached
with the Reinstatement Value Clause issued along with the policy,
so the answering Respondent-insurer (NIACL) was filing the copy
of the policy with complete terms and conditions and clauses along
with the written statement – In the replication filed by the Insured,
there was no denial of this averment. [Paras 31 and 32]
* Author
286 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Insurance – Computation of loss on depreciation basis – Was
NIACL justified in computing loss on depreciation basis and
fixing depreciation at 60%:
Held: It emerges clearly that under the main terms of the policy the
company was to pay the Insured the value of the property at the
time of happening of the destruction (except where NIACL opts to
reinstate) – There was a special memorandum attached to the policy
– That memorandum was the Reinstatement Value Clause which
substituted the basis upon which the amount was payable from the
value on the date of destruction to the cost of replacing or reinstating
the property i.e. property of the same kind or type but not superior
or more extensive than the insured property when new – However,
as it transpires the said memorandum ceased to have any force
since the Insured was unable and unwilling to replace or reinstate
the property – Special Provision 4 (b) of the memorandum applied
and rendered the Reinstatement Value Clause ineffective – Also,
the Insured under Clause 6(b) of the conditions had an obligation to
give NIACL all such further particulars, plans, specifications, books,
vouchers and invoices with respect to the claim – It is sufficiently
brought out that in spite of the surveyors writing to the Insured
repeatedly (on 14.12.1998, 03.05.2002, 24.06.2002 and 07.08.2002),
there was no information forthcoming from the Insured about the
invoices as proof of the value of the damaged equipment and the
cost of the new equipment – Instead, the insured originally undertook
that they will reinstate the damaged property; received the on account
payment of Rs.4,92,80,905/- and informed NIACL that they have
placed order for repair of 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill – Thereafter by their
letter of 16.06.1999, the Insured sought assessment of net adjusted
loss at Rs.20.95 Crores – The surveyors of NIACL kept asking for
the basic and relevant particulars, the Insured without furnishing
the same kept asking for the settlement of the money – NIACL
did not completely repudiate the claim – NIACL cannot be faulted
for resorting to depreciation method – NIACL was also justified in
writing the letter of 12.11.2002 (to increase the depreciation to 60%)
because after reviving the demand to reinstate the plant, the Insured
failed to furnish the documents required and even admittedly the
plant as allegedly reinstated was of 6 Hi Cold Rolling Plant and
not 20 Hi Cold Rolling Plant – An additional affidavit was also filed
by NIACL before NCDRC to clarify the established practice for
computing depreciation – The base figure of Rs. 20.09 crores was
kept intact – Insured stood to gain by keeping figure at Rs. 20.09
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 287

crores – The depreciation at 60% upheld – Thus, the NIACL rightly
ordered the settlement of the claim on 03.01.2003 stating the loss
amount as Rs.7.88 Crores and ordering the balance amount of 2.88
crores be paid after adjusting the on account payment. [Paras 57,

Insurance – Is the Insured justified in claiming reinstatement
value by placing reliance on the judgment in Oswal Plastic
Industries:
Held: No clause similar to the memorandum of reinstatement
value clause appears to have existed in Oswal Plastic Industries
– Oswal Plastic Industries has no application to the facts of the
present case. [Para 75]

1. Leave granted in SLP (Civil) No. 10001 of 2009.
2. I.A. No. 48152 of 2022 in Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009 is filed by
the Respondent [earlier known as M/s Bhushan Steel and Strips
Ltd, hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant” or the “Insured”]
seeking change of its name in the proceedings to ‘Tata Steel Ltd’. The
Complainant/Insured has filed similar IAs in the connected appeals
filed by it. It is stated that the name of the Complainant/Insured
was changed to ‘Bhushan Steel Ltd’ in the year 2007. Thereafter
while these appeals were pending, the company underwent a
Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process and was successfully
taken over by ‘Tata Steel Ltd’ on 27.11.2018 and was renamed as
‘Tata Steel BSL Ltd’. Thereafter, it is seen that the Complainant/
Insured further underwent a merger/amalgamation and was finally
merged/amalgamated with ‘Tata Steel Ltd’ w.e.f. 11.11.2021. In
view of the said facts, all the applications for change of name are
allowed.
3. These are four Civil Appeals arising out of the proceedings in Original
Petition No. 233 of 2000 before the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi [“NCDRC”].
4. Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009 has been filed by the New India
Assurance Company Limited [hereinafter referred to as “NIACL” or
the “Insurer” or the “Insurance Company”] challenging the order
dated 05.08.2008 of the NCDRC. By the said order, the NCDRC
partly allowed the complaint of the Insured. The NCDRC awarded
an amount of Rs.13,15,27,000/- with interest at 10% per annum from
the expiry of two months since the submission of survey report dated
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 289
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
11.12.2001, payable to the Insured. The amount already paid by the
Insurance Company was ordered to be adjusted and a cost of Rs.
50,000/- was also awarded to the Insured. NIACL, in this Appeal,
is aggrieved with the finding that the Complainant’s claim must be
settled, based on calculating depreciation at the rate of 32% - and
not 60%.
5. The Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(Civil) No. 10001 of 2009
has been filed by the Insured/Complainant. The grievance here
is against the dismissal of Misc. Application No. 298 of 2008 in
Original Petition No. 233 of 2000 seeking review of the order
dated 05.08.2008.
6. Civil Appeal Nos. 5242-5243 of 2009 have been filed by the Insured/
Complainant against the main order dated 05.08.2008 (passed in
O.P. No. 233 of 2000) and order dated 29.08.2008 (allowing the
application for rectification and correcting the figure awarded to Rs.
13,51,27,000/- instead of Rs. 13,15,27,000/-) respectively.
7. The grievance pleaded by the Insured/Complainant in its connected
appeals is that the compensation awarded ought to have been greater
because, according to it, the base figure on which the depreciation
of 32% was computed should have been Rs.28 Crores and not
Rs.20,09,95,000/-. The claim was that, so computing, the amount
payable by NIACL should have been Rs. 18.91 Crores.
Brief Summary of Facts:
8. The Insured had taken an insurance policy from NIACL for the
entire machinery and equipment of its mill by paying a premium
of Rs.62,09,655/-. The policy was for the period 29.09.1998
to 28.09.1999. According to the Insured, due to a fire accident
on 12.12.1998, the ‘20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill’ fitted with imported
equipment was fully destroyed resulting in a loss of Rs. 35.08
crores. The incident of fire was intimated to NIACL on 12.12.1998
itself. Surveyors ‘M/s R.K. Singhal and Company Pvt. Ltd.’ and
subsequently ‘M/s A.K. Govil and Associates’ and ‘M/s P.C. Gandhi’
were appointed by NIACL. A claim for Rs. 35.08 crores was filed
on 29.01.1999. According to the Insured, this was based upon
the quotations received from various manufacturers of the said
machinery and the complete details of cost for replacing and/or
repairing the machines.
290 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
9. The Insured also pleaded that since the running of the company
was important, it got a 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill installed in its unit and
commenced production by spending Rs.29.60 crores apart from
excise duties.
10. Admittedly, based on the interim report of the surveyors, a sum of
Rs.4,92,80,905/- was released in favour of the Insured by NIACL
on 24.03.1999. According to the Insured, after the release of the
amount, it placed an order with ‘M/s Flat Products Equipments (India)
Limited’ [“M/s Flat Products”] for reinstating the 20 Hi Cold Rolling
machine by replacing the totally damaged and partially damaged
parts for a total sum of Rs.25 crores, and paid Rs.3,75,00,000/- to
M/s Flat Products by way of advance payment. Further, a sum of
Rs.47.50 lacs on account of inspection charges of mill housing
and Rs. 25 lacs for transportation of mill housing were also paid.
According to the Insured, though it lost more than Rs. 25 crores,
in view of the persistence from the Insurance Company, vide letter
dated 16.06.1999, it gave consent for receiving Rs.20.95 Crores as
net adjusted loss to avoid loss of time.
11. According to the Insured, since no response was forthcoming and
the balance amount was not released, Consumer Complaint bearing
Case No. 233 of 2000 was filed by the Insured before the NCDRC
on 30.05.2000.
12. According to NIACL, after receipt of the information about the fire
accident on 12.12.1998, NIACL immediately appointed the surveyors
and soon thereafter, on the basis of the interim survey report, on-
account payments were made. The Joint Surveyors submitted their
report on 11.12.2001. The vigilance complaints were also closed
on 18.01.2002.
13. According to NIACL, it was only on 27.03.2002 that the Insured
informed NIACL about the fact of having already installed a new
6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill and requested them for joint inspection with
the surveyors. In the Joint Surveyors’ Report of 11.12.2001, the
loss was assessed at Rs.19.55 crores on replacement basis and
Rs.13.51 crores on depreciation basis. The surveyors, on 03.05.2002,
requested the Complainant to furnish several information for which
there was no response. It was contended by NIACL that the plea of
the Insured in their letter of 27.03.2002 that it had placed an order
for cold rolling mill on 11.01.1999 and the same was installed in
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 291
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
September-October, 1999 at the cost of Rs. 31.37 crores and the
prayer that the replacement should be treated as reinstatement, is
completely unacceptable. The machine installed is 6 Hi Cold Rolling
as against the damaged mill which was 20 Hi Cold Rolling. According
to NIACL, the claim has been rightly settled at Rs.7.88 Crores.
Proceedings before the NCDRC:
14. Though several other points were argued before us by the Insured,
the point canvassed before the NCDRC [and pleaded in the Insured’s
connected Appeals] related only to the calculation of depreciation. The
argument taken by the Insured before the NCDRC was that NIACL
was not justified in computing depreciation at 60% while the surveyors
in the reports had recommended 32% as depreciation. The NCDRC
observed that the effort by the Insured to install a lesser capacity 6
Hi Cold Rolling Mill was an effort in desperation. It also found the
claim to be genuine. Addressing the issue of depreciation, it held
that after the initial recommendation in the Joint Surveyors’ Report
dated 11.12.2001 of computing 32% depreciation, the surveyors were
persuaded by the letter of the Insurance Company dated 12.11.2002
to increase the depreciation to 60%. An additional affidavit was called
for from the NIACL to justify the depreciation at 60%. After perusing
the affidavit, the NCDRC held that there were no standard guidelines
for calculating depreciation and that it had been calculated differently
for different units. According to the NCDRC, the affidavit quoted the
instances of very high depreciation just to suit the convenience of
NIACL. It may be mentioned that the affidavit relied on certain cases
where depreciation was computed at a maximum rate up to 75% -
80%. The NCDRC held that the issuance of the letter of the Insurance
Company to the Surveyors seeking revision of calculation was issued
eleven months after the Joint Surveyors’ Report dated 11.12.2001
and that this was not a healthy practice. So holding, it maintained
the depreciation at 32% and directed the payments as noted above.
Appeal to this Court:
15. The appeal by NIACL seeks depreciation to be fixed at 60%.
The Insured also in its appeals has focused only on the issue of
depreciation with the argument being that the base figure on which
32% depreciation was calculated should have been Rs.28 crores
and not Rs.20.09 crores. There are no other grounds raised in the
memo of the appeal.
292 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
16. However, the Insured during the course of submission, while candidly
admitting that no other point had been raised in the memo of appeal,
relied on the judgment in Oswal Plastic Industries v. Manager, Legal
Deptt N.A.I.C.O. Ltd., [2023 SCC OnLine SC 43] to contend that the
reinstatement value should have been awarded in full and that in the
case of reinstatement value no question of depreciation arises. This
argument has been dealt with herein below at an appropriate stage.
Contentions of NIACL:-
17. Appearing for NIACL, learned Senior Counsel Mr. Sanjay Jain
contended that the insurance policy had a special condition in the
form of Reinstatement Value Clause; that there are two methods of
settlement of a claim depending on the nature of the policy, namely,
the reinstatement value basis and market value basis (or depreciation
basis); that under the Reinstatement Value Clause, the method of
indemnity was to be the “cost of replacing or reinstating the same i.e.
property of the same kind or type but not superior or more extensive
than the insured property when new”; that the reinstatement was to
be carried out by the Insured within 12 months or within such further
extended time; that para 2 of the Special Provisions provided that
until expenditure has been incurred by the Insured in replacing/
reinstating the damaged property, the Insurance Company shall not
be liable to pay any amount in excess of the amount which would
have been payable under the policy, if the said reinstatement clause
had not been incorporated; para 4 of the Special Provisions provided
that if the Insured expressed its intention to replace/reinstate the
damaged property and the Insured is unable or unwilling to replace
the damaged property on the same or another site, the reinstatement
clause was to be rendered ineffective.
18. Adverting to the impugned judgment, learned Senior Counsel
contended that the findings that (i) the insurer, out of sheer
desperation, bought the 6 Hi configuration; (ii) the depreciation rate
as calculated by the NIACL was erroneous; and (iii) NIACL’s letter
to the surveyor asking for a revised calculation was not a healthy
practice, are all erroneous findings which are completely untenable.
According to learned Senior Counsel, the Insured in violation of
the undertaking did not take any steps for reinstatement; that there
was no delay on the part of the Insurance Company and in fact on
account payment of Rs. 4,92,80,905/- had been released as early as
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 293
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
on 24.03.1999; that the NCDRC overlooked the fact that the Insured
did not comeback to the Insurance Company with any information
for about 08 months and only on 26.11.1999, followed by another
letter of 10.02.2000 asked for extension of time limit for reinstatement
of the insured property; that the same was accommodated by the
NIACL and on 07.03.2000, an extension of 12 months was given
and which time limit period was also not adhered to; that the Insured
after receiving the interim payment claimed that Rs. 3.75 crores were
advanced to M/s Flat Products and the said vendor neither repaired
the insured property nor replaced the same; that nearly two years
later on 28.06.2001, M/s Flat Products informed the Insured that
they had lost their expertise and, as such, the delay could not be
attributed to the NIACL; that the Insured informed the NIACL about
having installed a 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill (as against the insured
property of 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill), on 27.03.2002, without revealing
the date of actual installation and without giving any comparable
specification, which unilateral act cannot be termed as “an act of
sheer desperation” as termed by the NCDRC.
19. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel that under the
aforesaid circumstances, the Reinstatement Value Clause was
rendered inoperative. However, the Insurance Company gave another
opportunity to act in good faith and provide necessary specification
and particulars, which were not provided for, in spite of the undertaking
in the letter of 09.07.2002. Hence, by no stretch of imagination could
the delay be attributable to the Insurance Company.
20. Insofar as the percentage of depreciation was concerned, it was
contended that the NCDRC erroneously disregarded the affidavit
filed by the Insurance Company clarifying the standard practice. On
the finding about the practice adopted by the Insurance Company
as “not being a healthy practice”, Mr. Sanjay Jain submitted that the
NIACL gave ample opportunities to provide cogent material and it
is only upon their failure to furnish the necessary documents, as
obligated in the policy, that NIACL was constrained to settle the
claim on market value basis by applying the necessary percentage
of depreciation. It was contended that in the report of 11.12.2001,
the joint surveyors, while arriving at the depreciation rate of 32%,
did not have any material. Therefore, it was a prudent act on the
part of the NIACL to arrive at a calculation on the basis of market
value with the applicable rates of depreciation, after informing the
294 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
surveyors that the reinstatement method was not an option any
longer. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the claim was
finally assessed by the surveyors, who in their survey report dated
07.12.2002 and after computing the balance life of ten years arrived
at the depreciation rate of 60%. Hence, NIACL’s conduct in accepting
that report could not be said to be arbitrary. It was argued that there
was no disagreement on the surveyor’s report.
21. The learned Senior Counsel emphasized that even today, the Insured
has no definite proof available with regard to the actual age of the
mill and as to when it was procured from its vendor; or under what
circumstances and condition the same was procured and other
essential details. In this background, the assessment made by
the surveyors, who are experts, could not be said to be illegal or
untenable. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the
recommendation of depreciation at 32% was at the stage when no
material was forthcoming and was not supported by any cogent
material and clarity on this aspect emerged only on the report of
07.12.2002. According to the learned Senior Counsel, ground (D)
in Civil Appeal Nos.5242-5243 of 2009 records an admission of the
Insured about the NCDRC rightly proceeding on depreciation basis.
22. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that there was no ambiguity and
hence there is no room for the applicability of doctrine of contra
proferentem. The survey report of 11.12.2001 was prepared at a
premature stage with all relevant disclaimers. Alternatively, it was
submitted that under Section 64 UM (2) of the Insurance Act, 1938,
the NIACL was entitled to differ from the recommendation of the
surveyor.
23. Learned Senior Counsel strongly refuted the reliance placed in the
convenience compilation, by the Insured on the judgment in Oswal
Plastic Industries (supra). Learned Senior Counsel contended
that Oswal Plastic Industries (supra) was not a case with the
Reinstatement Value Clause as a special condition. Learned Senior
Counsel contended that unlike in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra),
Clause 9 had no application to the facts of the present case. That in
any event documents were not provided by the Insured to NIACL.
Dealing with Regulation 9(3) of the IRDA (Protection of Policyholders’
Interests) Regulations, 2002 [“IRDA Regulations”], learned Senior
Counsel submitted that the joint surveyors report dated 07.12.2002
was for all intents and purposes the original surveyors report and as
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 295
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
such Regulation 9(3) assuming it to be mandatory had no application.
Alternatively, it was contended that Regulation 9(3) is only directory.
24. Insofar as the cross appeal is concerned, the learned Senior Counsel
contended that the claim for the base figure as Rs. 28 crores is
absolutely unjustified, there being no cogent material to support the
same. In fact, the stand of the Insured was that its vendor M/s Flat
Products had expressed its inability due to loss of expertise and the
same was conveyed two years after receiving the advance. For all
these reasons, the learned Senior Counsel prayed that the appeal
of NIACL be allowed and the appeals of the Insured be dismissed.
Contentions of the Insured/Complainant: -
25. Mr. Joy Basu, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Insured,
at the very outset, contended that the memorandum containing the
Reinstatement Value Clause was never part of the policy document
issued by the NIACL. This memorandum, according to the learned
senior counsel, was never received by the Insured. Without prejudice
to the same, it is contended that Clause 9 of the conditions in the
policy has to be read in conjunction with the Reinstatement Value
Clause. Since, as per para 4, the Reinstatement Value Clause got
extinguished, Clause 9 of the conditions became applicable.
26. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that in terms of Clause 9 where
reinstatement/repair is not possible, the surveyor’s assessment of
reinstatement has to be complied with. Learned senior counsel relied
on the judgment in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra). Learned
Senior Counsel contended that the interpretation of Clause 9 was
laid down only by the Oswal Plastic Industries (supra) judgment
in January, 2023 and as such the Insured should be allowed
to canvass the argument based on Oswal Plastic Industries
(supra). According to learned Senior Counsel, the inability/failure
to reinstate as contemplated in the last part of the Clause 9 is the
failure of the NIACL. Learned Senior Counsel further contended
that it is only with the hope of an expedited settlement that the
Insured accepted the lower figure of Rs. 20.95 Crores. Calculating
on reinstatement basis, the surveyors in their report of 11.12.2001
arrived at the figure of Rs. 19.55 crores without application of any
depreciation. According to the Insured, the amount further due is
Rs.11,80,87,699/-.
296 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
27. Alternatively, it is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel that even
if the market value basis is to be applied, depreciation has to be
calculated on the sum insured of Rs. 80 crores. To support this plea,
learned Senior Counsel relied on Dharmendra Goel vs. Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. (2008) 8 SCC 279. Further, without prejudice,
it is contended that if depreciation was not to be calculated on the
sum insured, then the depreciation has to be calculated on the cost
of the new locally sourced 20 Hi Cold Rolling Machine which would
cost Rs. 25 crores plus taxes totaling Rs 28 crores. Further, it is
contended that the depreciation rate was 32% as mentioned by the
surveyors in their report of 11.12.2001 and NIACL has not adduced
any reasons for deviating from the recommendation of the surveyors.
Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the surveyor’s response of
07.12.2002 was “a reluctant response from an embarrassed surveyor”
to the letter of NIACL dated 12.01.2002 which, according to the learned
senior counsel, was a letter by the insurer asking the surveyors to
compute maximum depreciation. In any event, according to the learned
Senior Counsel, the doctrine of contra proferentem applied and the
interpretation in favour of the Insured should have been adopted. It
was argued that there was a breach of Regulation 9(3) of the IRDA
Regulations. So contending, the learned senior counsel prayed that
the appeal of NIACL be dismissed and the cross appeals of the
Insured be allowed.
Questions before this Court:
28. In the above background, the questions that arise for consideration
are as follows:
i. Was the Reinstatement Value Clause part of the policy?
ii. Was NIACL justified in computing loss on depreciation basis
and fixing depreciation at 60%?
iii. Is the Insured justified in claiming reinstatement value by placing
reliance on the judgment in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra)?
iv. To what reliefs are the parties entitled?
Discussion and Reasons:
29. At the outset, it is important to set out the crucial clauses of the
policy in question.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 297
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
Fire Policy “C”
In consideration of the insured name in the schedule

Company Limited (hereinafter called the company)
the premium mentioned in the said schedule. THE
COMPANY AGREES (subject to the Condition and
Exclusions contained herein or endorsed or otherwise
expressed hereon) that it after payment of the

Conditions
……
6. (i) On the happening of any loss or damage the

company and shall within 15 days after the loss or
damage or such further time as the Company may in
writing allow in that behalf, deliver to the company;

298 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
The insured shall also at all times at his own expense
produce, procure and give to the company all such
further particulars, plans, specifications, books,
vouchers, invoices, duplicates or copies thereof,
documents investigation reports (internal/external),
proof and information with respect to the claim and
the origin and cause of the insured perils and the
circumstances under which the loss or damage
occurred, and any matter touching the liability or the
amount of the liability of the Company as may be
reasonably required by or on behalf of the Company
together with a declaration on Oath or in other legal
form of the truth of the claim and of any matter
connected therewith.
No claim under this policy shall be payable unless
the terms of this condition have been complied with.
30. Two other important clauses viz., Clause 9 of the Conditions and
the memorandum containing the Reinstatement Value Clause are
extracted below at the appropriate place in the discussion.
Answer to Question No (i) :-
31. There was a debate at the Bar as to whether the memorandum
consisting of the Reinstatement Value Clause (extracted later in
the judgment) was a part of the policy. The argument was raised by
senior counsel for the Insured who contended that the memorandum
containing the Reinstatement Value Clause was not part of the policy.
We reject this contention at the outset. This is for the reason that
before the NCDRC in the written statement filed by the NIACL, in
para 3, it was specifically pleaded as under:
“The copy of the fire policy at pages 13 to 22 is a true
copy of the policy issued by the Respondent. However, the
Reinstatement Value Clause issued along with the policy
is not attached to the same. The answering Respondent
is filing herewith the copy of the policy with complete
terms and conditions and clauses as Annexure R-1 to
this written Statement.”
32. In the replication filed by the Insured, there was no denial of this
averment. Hence, we reject the contention of the Insured that the
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 299
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
memorandum of the Reinstatement Value Clause was not the
part of the policy. There are other factors which establish that
the Reinstatement Value Clause was part of the Policy. They are
discussed hereinbelow. Issue (i), set out above, is answered in favor
of NIACL.
Discussion of Question No. (ii) :-
33. Coming back to the clauses in the insurance policy, it will be seen
that the assurance in the opening clause of the policy was that NIACL
will pay to the Insured the value of the property at the time of the
happening of its destruction OR the amount of such damage OR
at its option, reinstate or replace such property or any part thereof.
In the conditions, it was incorporated that the Insured was at all
times at its own expense to produce, procure and give to NIACL
all such further particulars, plans, specifications, books, vouchers,
invoices, duplicates or copies thereof, documents, investigation
reports (internal/external), proof and information with respect to the
claim and all matters provided for in Clause 6. It is also stipulated
that no claim under this policy was payable unless the terms of this
condition was complied with.
34. Clause 9 of the Conditions states that if NIACL, at its option, reinstate
or replace the property damaged or destroyed, or any part thereof,
instead of paying the amount of loss or damage, or join with any
other company or Insurance in so doing, NIACL shall not be bound
to reinstate exactly or completely but only as circumstances permit
and in reasonably sufficient manner, and in no case shall NIACL be
bound to spend more in reinstatement than it would have cost to
reinstate such property as it was at the time of occurrence of such
loss or damage nor more than the sum insured by the Company
thereon. Clause 9 reads as follows:
“9. If the company at its option, reinstate or replace the
property damaged or destroyed, or any part thereof, instead
of paying the amount of the loss or damage, or join with
any other company or insurance, in so doing, the company
shall not be bound to reinstate exactly or completely but
only as circumstances permit and in reasonably sufficient
manner and in no case shall the company be bound to
spend more in reinstatement than it would have cost
to reinstate such property as it was at the time of the
300 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
occurrence of such loss or damage nor more than the
sum insured by the Company thereon,
If the Company so elect to reinstate or replace an property
the insured shall at his own expense furnish the company
with such plans, specifications, measurements, quantities
and such other particulars as the company may require, and
no acts done, or caused to be done, by the company with
a view to reinstatement or replacement shall be deemed
an election by the Company to reinstate or replace.
If in any case the Company shall be unable to reinstate
or repair the property hereby insured, because of any
municipal or other regulations in force affecting the
alignment of streets or the construction of buildings or
otherwise, the Company shall, in every such case, only be
liable to pay such sum as would be requisite to reinstate
or repair such property if the same could lawfully be
reinstated to its former condition.”
35. To the policy is attached the memorandum of the Reinstatement
Value Clause which reads as follows:
REINSTATEMENT VALUE CLAUSE
Attached to and forming part of policy No.
It is hereby declared and agreed that in the event of the
property Insured under (Items Nos. of ) the within policy
being destroyed or damaged, the basis upon which the
amount payable under each of the said items of the
policy is to be calculated, shall be the cost of replacing
or reinstating on the same, i.e. property of the same
kind or type but not superior or more extensive than
the insured property when new subject to the following
Special Provisions and subject also to the terms and
conditions of the policy except manner as the same may
be varied hereby.
SPECIAL PROVISIONS
1. The work of the replacement or reinstatement (which
may be carried out upon another site and in any
manner suitable to the requirements of the insured
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 301
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
subject to the liability of the Company not being
thereby increased) must be commenced and carried
out with reasonable dispatch and in any case must be
completed within 12 months after the destruction or
damage or within such further time as the company
may (during the said 12 months) in writing allow;
otherwise no payment beyond the amount which
would have been payable under the policy if this
memorandum had not been incorporated therein
shall be made.
2. Until expenditure has been incurred by the Insured
in replacing or reinstating the property destroyed or
damaged the company shall not be liable for any
payment in excess of the amount which would have
been payable under the policy if this memorandum
had not been incorporated therein.
3. If at the time of replacement or reinstatement the sum
representing the cost which would have been incurred
in replacement or reinstatement if the whole of the
property covered had been destroyed exceeds the
sum insured thereon at the breaking out of any fire or
at the commencement of any destruction of or damage
to such property by any other peril insured against by
this policy, then the Insured shall be considered as
being his own insurer for the excess and shall bear
a rateable proportion of the loss accordingly. Each
item of the policy (it more than one) to which this
Memorandum applies shall be separately subject to
the foregoing provision.
4. This Memorandum shall be without force or effect if:
(a) The Insured fails to intimate to the company
within 6 months from the date of destruction or
damage or such further time as the Company
may in writing allow, his intention to replace or
reinstate the property destroyed or damaged.
(b) The Insured is unable or unwilling to replace or
reinstate the property destroyed or damaged on
the same or another site.
302 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
36. The memorandum of the Reinstatement Value Clause stipulates that
it was declared and agreed that in the event of the property Insured
under the policy being destroyed or damaged,
a. The basis upon which the amount payable under each of the
said items of the policy is to be calculated, shall be the cost of
replacing or reinstating on the same, i.e. property of the same
kind or type but not superior or more extensive than the insured
property when new subject to the following Special Provisions
and subject also to the terms and conditions of the policy except
manner as the same may be varied hereby.
b. The Special Provisions stipulate that the work of the replacement
or reinstatement must be commenced and carried out with
reasonable dispatch and in any case must be completed within
12 months after the destruction or damage or within such further
time as the company may (during the said 12 months) in writing
allow; otherwise no payment beyond the amount which would
have been payable under the policy if this memorandum had
not been incorporated therein shall be made.
c. Until expenditure has been incurred by the insured in replacing
the property destroyed or damaged, the company shall not be
liable for any payment in excess of the amount which would
have been payable under the policy if this memorandum had
not been incorporated therein.
d. If at the time of replacement or reinstatement the sum
representing the cost which would have been incurred in
replacement or reinstatement if the whole of the property
covered had been destroyed exceeds the sum insured thereon
at the breaking out of any fire or at the commencement of
any destruction of or damage to such property by any other
peril insured against by this policy, then the Insured shall be
considered as being his own insurer for the excess and shall
bear a rateable proportion of the loss accordingly. Each item of
the policy (if more than one) to which this memorandum applies
was to be separately subject to the following provisions.
e. This Memorandum was to be without force or effect if
i. The Insured fails to intimate to the company within 6 months
from the date of destruction or damage or such further
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 303
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
time as the Company may in writing allow, his intention to
replace or reinstate the property destroyed or damaged.
ii. The Insured is unable or unwilling to replace or reinstate
the property destroyed or damaged on the same or
another site.”
37. It is very clear from the above that the original terms of the policy
which provided for payment by NIACL of the value of the property
at the time of the happening of its destruction or the amount of such
damage was varied and the basis was changed. The changed basis
under the Memorandum of the Reinstatement Value Clause was
that the amount payable was to be calculated based on the cost of
replacing or reinstating the same, i.e. property of the same kind or
type but not superior or more extensive than the insured property
when new.
38. It is also clear that in view of the Reinstatement Value Clause, the
question of NIACL on the facts of the present case opting to reinstate
or replace under Clause 9 of the conditions of the policy does not
arise and with the same reasoning, the question of the applicability
of Clause 9 itself cannot arise.
Relevant Facts as they unfolded:-
39. At this stage, it is important to deal with the correspondence that
was exchanged between the parties to bring out as to how under
the Reinstatement Value Clause, it was the Insured who attempted
to reinstate or replace the property which was destroyed. As will be
clear from the sequence of the events, it was the Insured who was
either unable to or unwilling thereafter to reinstate the property. Let
us see how the facts unfolded. On 12.12.1998 i.e., the date of the
fire, the Insured intimated NIACL and requested for the surveyors
to be deputed. On 14.12.1998, the surveyors wrote to the Insured
requesting for various information including year wise capitalization,
balance sheets of the previous two years, copy of the original invoices
of affected items as well as fresh proforma invoice and the logbook
and any other maintenance record. In the reply of 18.12.1998, crucial
information with regard to the original invoice as well as proforma
invoice were not furnished. An interim survey report was prepared
on 04.02.1999 by the three surveyors in the joint report and that
report had the following disclaimer:
304 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“Based on the physical inspection carried out and limited
information made available by the Insured till then, the
above surveyors submitted their joint survey report on
22nd December 1998. Subsequently, the underwriters
appointed P.C. Gandhi & Associates as another joint
surveyors. The joint surveyors visited the insured factory
jointly and severally on various dates and carried out
detailed physical inspection of the subject machine besides
carrying out protracted discussions with the Insured official
accompanied by Supplier/Manufacturers of the Mill.”
40. The interim survey report noticed that the claim was for Rs.35
Crores and the effective claim excluding excise duty was Rs.30.28
crores. Dealing with the assessment of loss, in Para 14, it was
mentioned in the report that the Insured lodged their claim based
on the price breakup given by manufacturers which included cost
of supply, installation and commissioning but excluded excise, sales
tax, transportation and civil works. The report mentioned that the
price break-up given was accepted in general at that stage and that
comparable cost could not be possible from an alternative source.
Most importantly, in Para 14 (1.4), it was provided as under:
“Policy provides for Reinstatement clause and Insured have
confirmed verbally that they would reinstate the damages
without any delay. At this stage, reasonable depreciation
and salvage are adjusted for considering conservative on
Account Payment.”
41. This clause also reinforces the fact that Reinstatement Value Clause
proving for reinstatement by the Insured was part of the policy. So
finding at Para 15, the surveyor in their interim report concluded as
under:
“It may be noted that while assessing the provisional loss,
substantial margin has been kept, even after considering
the depreciation etc. Based on the limited verification
carried out till now, we are of considered opinion that
the minimum loss on Reinstatement Value Basis is like
to be around Rs. 1500 lacs and the maximum loss on
Reinstatement Value Basis after more detailed verifications
has been estimated at around Rs. 2500 lacs.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 305
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
In consideration of the Insured’s request for an On Account
Payment, should be Underwriters so desire, they may
consider an On Account Payment of upto Rs. 720 Lacs
at this stage.”
It was clearly mentioned that the report was issued without prejudice,
and subject to terms and conditions of the relevant insurance policy.
42. This report was followed by a letter issued by the Insured on
10.02.1999.
“We undertake that reinstatement of damaged property
on account of fire loss caused on 12.12.1998, shall be
carried out by us within the stipulated time as per fire policy
No.1132160705785. We confirm that suggestions given in
the TAC and LPA report will be complied with during the
reinstatement of the mill.”
On 24.03.1999, on account payment of Rs. 4,98,80,905/- was made.
43. Thereafter, on 10.06.1999, the Insured wrote to M/s Flat Products
placing an order for repair of the ‘20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill’ and paying
them an amount of Rs. 3.75 crores as 15% advance. It transpires
that on 06.10.1999, the Chief Vigilance Officer of NIACL addressed
a letter to the General Manager, NIACL furnishing a report about
an anonymous complaint received stating that the fire was due to
arson and that there has been inflated assessments resulting in
approval of huge on account payments. The report concluded that
there was no indication that the fire was due to arson but there were
indications that the loss could have been assessed for highly inflated
amount. The Chief Vigilance Officer sounded a note of caution to
the following effect:
“Therefore, adequate precautions should be taken before
a final decision is taken in respect of the claim. We would
like to suggest that an opinion of technical expert in
the concerned field may be taken regarding extent and
assessment of loss in order to arrive at the actual loss
sustained by the claimant. You may also examine the
feasibility of having into depth technical investigation into
various objects of the claim.”
44. When matter stood thus on 16.06.1999, the Insured wrote to the
surveyors stating as under:
306 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“However, against contract price of Rs. 25 crores, we
agree and confirm to the assessment of the net adjusted
loss of Rs. 20,95,00,000/- (Indian Rupees Twenty Crores
Ninety Five Lakhs Only) after taking into account the items
of salvage & excess as applicable under the terms and
conditions of the policy.”
45. On 27.10.1999, the Insured wrote a letter to NIACL (inter alia referring
to the earlier letters of 21.08.1999, 05.10.1999 & 12.10.1999) stating
that in spite of the expiry of ten months, the claim amount has not
been settled, and that the supplier was asking them to make further
payment otherwise the work would not start. So stating a request was
made for the settlement of the claim at the earliest. This was followed
by another letter of 26.11.1999 stating that since the claim had not
yet been settled they could not progress in the reinstatement of the
mill. They also sought extension of 24 months for the reinstatement
of the mill.
46. The Insured also wrote a letter of 16.12.1999 referring to their earlier
letter of 23.07.1999 to the effect that the original invoices in respect
of Cold Rolling Mill were not available with them; that their supplier
M/s Flat Products has confirmed that the sale bill of the 20 Hi Cold
Rolling Mill is not available with them; they furnished a letter of M/s
Mukand Limited, Thane dated 09.12.1999 addressed to M/s Flat
Products confirming that two number of Mill Housings were supplied
by them to M/s Precision Equipment, a sister concern of M/s Flat
Products; a letter of M/s Flat Products dated 09.12.1999 that two
numbers of SENDZIMIR were sold to M/s Jawahar Metal Industries
Pvt. Limited, the previous name of the Insured and that housing for
these mills were procured from M/s Mukand Ltd. vide their invoice
dated 23.03.1988 and 09.01.1989.
47. In substance, no concrete information was forthcoming from the
Insured, and while claiming that the invoices were not available
certain indirect evidence in the form of certificates for part supply
were attempted to be furnished. Most importantly these certificates
were of dates which were after the fire.
48. Another letter of 10.02.2000 repeating the same request for payment
was made by the Insured. The NIACL responded by their letter of
07.03.2000 granting extension of 12 months for reinstatement of the
damaged mill. All these clearly indicate that the Reinstatement Value
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 307
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
Clause was part of the policy and that the Insured had agreed to
reinstate in accordance with the said clause. Thereafter, the Insured
wrote a letter dated 28.04.2000 clearly setting out the following:
“This has reference to the correspondence in connection
with the above referred claim. After detailed discussions
on various occasions with the loss assessors appointed
by you, we accepted the settlement arrived at by the
surveyor on repair loss basis. As desired by the surveyors,
we gave a letter of acceptance vide letter dated 16.6.99
for the assessment of the net adjusted loss of Rs. 20.95
Crores after taking into account the items of salvage and
excesses as applicable under the terms of the policy
(copy enclosed). It is regretted that even after releasing
on account payment of Rs. 5 Crore on 24th March, 1999
the matter is lying pending for the last about 1½ year in
spite of our various meetings with you and also various
letters written from time to time.”
49. It is very clear from this letter that the Insured accepted the net
adjusted loss of Rs.20.95 Crores and a letter accepting the same
dated 16.06.1999 was given to the surveyor. Thereafter, the Insured,
getting no response, on 30.05.2000, filed the Consumer Complaint
No. 233 of 2000 for the following reliefs:
a) Rs. 15.95 crores on account of balance claim for fire loss.
b) Interest @ 18% from 16.06.1999 till its actual payment.
c) Rs. 73 lacs on account of inspection and transportation charges.
d) Damages @ Rs. 3 crores per month since August, 1999 till the
release of payment as prayed for under claim (a).
50. From the written statement, apart from the other facts, it was set out
that on 06.10.1999, the Chief Vigilance Officer has suggested that the
opinion of technical expert be taken before taking the final decision
in the matter. Thereafter, further complaints were received resulting
in the appointment of M/s J. Basheer & Associates who submitted
their report on 10.04.2000. It was also averred that on 26.07.2000,
the CBI approached NIACL with respect to some complaint filed by
the Respondent and in that context, the CBI had called the officials of
NIACL on 26.07.2000, 20.03.2001, 29.03.2001. Earlier on 16.04.2000,
308 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the CBI requisitioned the Respondent’s claim file pertaining to the
case. It was averred that on 18.09.2000, NIACL appointed M/s Allianz
Zentrum Fur Technik GmBH, Germany who gave their opinion on
26.10.2000. Since that report was not based on physical examination,
Allianz was called to do a physical examination and the detailed
report came on 10.07.2001. On 11.12.2001, according to NIACL,
the Joint Surveyors submitted their report where they assessed the
loss of the damaged mill at 19.55 crores on replacement basis and
13.51 crores on depreciation basis. It was only on 18.01.2002, the
Chief Vigilance Officer closed the complaints received.
51. It was averred in the Written Statement that on 27.03.2002, the
Insured for the first time informed NIACL that they had already
installed a new Cold Rolling Mill. An undated letter was annexed
purportedly informing the same facts. NIACL averred that the said
undated letter was not received. The NIACL submitted that the said
letter of 27.03.2002 was sent to the surveyors. In pursuance thereof,
the surveyors wrote a letter dated 03.05.2002 requesting for the
following information:
i. Copy of the order placed with M/s Flat Products.
ii. Copy of the quotation submitted by M/s Flat Products prior to
placement of the order and copy of the inquiry floated by them.
iii. Whether the interest of any financial institutions or banks or any
of the sister concerns or private companies exists in the new
Mill or not? If yes, please submit relevant documents.
iv. Certificate of the Chartered Accountant confirming date of
capitalization for the said Mill. The certificate should endorse
all the invoices forming part of the Mill capitalization. One set
of invoices may be submitted along with the certificate.
52. There was no response resulting in the surveyors writing another
letter of 24.06.2002. On 09.07.2002, the insured sought two week’s
time to submit the information. With no information forthcoming, on
07.08.2002, once again the surveyors wrote to the Insured. Thereafter,
it was submitted that till date the mill has not been reinstated. NIACL
submitted that the claim that, at the cost of Rs.31.37 crores, the cold
rolling mill was installed, is absolutely incorrect. It was averred that
Cold Rolling Mill installed by the complainant is a 6 Hi Cold Rolling
Mill whereas the damaged mill was 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill and that
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 309
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
the two mills are of different models and that 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill
cannot be treated as reinstatement. So contending, it was pleaded
that the surveyors had submitted their report on 11.12.2001 in
which they had assessed the Insured’s loss at Rs.13.51 crores
on depreciation basis and Rs.19.55 crores on reinstatement basis
and that the Insured has not submitted any document/material for
reinstatement.
53. It is also important to note that on 28.06.2001, M/s Flat Products, with
whom the insured was on talks with for reinstatement, had written
to the Insured clearly indicating in that letter as follows:
“…. In the meantime, the specialists and designers who
were engaged for the manufacturing/repairs of 20 Hi
1250mm wide mill for cold rolling mild steel have left our
company and we are now not in position to repair/supply
your 20 Hi, 1250mm wide mill for Cold Rolling Mild Steel.
This fact was also made known to the Inspecting team
from Germany by our Director, Sh. D.D. Sengupta, to
survey the loss of the aforesaid machine.”
NIACL Letter to Surveyors:-
54. On 12.11.2002, NIACL wrote to the surveyors stating that the insured
are unable to produce invoices to establish the cost and age of
the mill affected in the said occurrence that considerable time has
elapsed and since the Insured has not been able to establish and
substantiate its claim, NIACL may consider the claim on depreciated
value basis taking into account the maximum depreciation applicable
to such mill. The surveyors were asked to have the workings on the
above lines.
Response of the Surveyors:-
55. In response, on 07.12.2022, the surveyors wrote to the NIACL
stating that in spite of several reminders the Insured as on date
had not submitted any clarification/details and as such the matter
had remained pending. As requested by the NIACL, an alternative
assessment by considering maximum depreciation was submitted
with the recommendation of 60% depreciation fixing loss at Rs.7.90
Crores.
56. It was explained that in the report of 11.12.2001, the depreciation was
adjusted to 32% considering the average life of the mill as 25 years.
310 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
That is 32% on overall for a period of usage of eight years at 4% per
year. Eight years were arrived at since the mill was installed in 1989
and the fire was happened in 1999. The balance life of mill was taken
as 17 years. In the letter it was clarified that as the machine was
running at its optimum capacity, it was their opinion that the residual
life as per the calculations should be 40% thereby implying applicable
depreciation of 60% and that when 60% depreciation is considered
the sum insured is deemed to be adequate. The residual life was
taken as less than 10 years. On 03.01.2003, the NIACL addressed
a letter to Insured stating that the loss amount as sanctioned would
be Rs. 7.88 crores and since Rs. 5 crores (after deducting TDS) has
already been paid, the balance amount would be Rs. 2.88 crores.
Answers to Question No. (ii):
a) Adoption of the Depreciation Method
57. From what has been discussed above, it emerges clearly that
under the main terms of the policy the company was to pay the
Insured the value of the property at the time of happening of the
destruction (except where NIACL opts to reinstate). There was a
special memorandum attached to the policy. That memorandum
was the Reinstatement Value Clause which substituted the basis
upon which the amount was payable from the value on the date of
destruction to the cost of replacing or reinstating the property i.e.
property of the same kind or type but not superior or more extensive
than the insured property when new. However, as it transpires the said
memorandum ceased to have any force since the Insured was unable
and unwilling to replace or reinstate the property. Special Provision
4 (b) of the memorandum applied and rendered the Reinstatement
Value Clause ineffective.
58. It is also amply clear that once we revert back to the original policy
with its conditions, the Insured under Clause 6(b) of the conditions
had an obligation to give NIACL all such further particulars, plans,
specifications, books, vouchers and invoices with respect to the claim.
It is also set out that no claim under the policy was to be payable
unless the terms of these conditions were duly complied with. It is
sufficiently brought out that in spite of the surveyors writing to the
Insured repeatedly (on 14.12.1998, 03.05.2002, 24.06.2002 and
07.08.2002), there was no information forthcoming from the Insured
about the invoices as proof of the value of the damaged equipment
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 311
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
and the cost of the new equipment. Instead, the Insured originally
undertook that they will reinstate the damaged property; received the
on account payment of Rs.4,92,80,905/- (i.e. Rs.05 Crores minus
TDS) and informed NIACL that they have placed order for repair of
20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill to M/s Flat Products and paid them Rs. 3.75
crores. Thereafter by their letter of 16.06.1999, the Insured sought
assessment of net adjusted loss at Rs.20.95 Crores. After this, without
showing any progress merely letters were written repeatedly asking
for early settlement. The scenario was while the surveyors of NIACL
kept asking for the basic and relevant particulars, the Insured without
furnishing the same kept asking for the settlement of the money.
59. Fortunately for the Insured, NIACL did not completely repudiate the
claim. Instead faced with the letters of the Insured dated 16.06.1999
admitting to the value at Rs.20.95 Crores and the letter of M/s Flat
Products of 28.06.2001 throwing up their hands and informing the
Insured about them having lost their expertise, NIACL resorted to
settling the claim under the opening clause of the policy by agreeing to
pay the Insured the value of the property at the time of the happening
of the destruction. (Depreciation Method)
60. We are not in a position to fault NIACL for resorting to this method
of settlement.
b) Quantum of Base Figure: -
61. NIACL also applied depreciation at the rate of 60% on the figure
of Rs.20.09 Crores. Whether this was a correct percentage of
depreciation was really the only dispute that was adjudicated before
the original forum. The Insured has a two-fold case to challenge
the basis of settlement adopted by NIACL before this Court. First,
they contend that the base figure should have been Rs.28 Crores
based on the figure they say M/s Flat Products was to charge them
for reinstating the 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill and after adding taxes to
the figure of Rs. 25 crores, they arrive at a base figure of Rs. 28
crores. This contention is totally untenable for the following reasons.
a. Firstly, by their letter of 16.06.1999, they categorically agree
and confirm to the assessment of the net adjusted loss at
Rs.20.95 Crores.
b. Secondly, there was no proof forthcoming from the Insured.
Since no invoices were furnished to state that the value of the
312 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
property on the date of the loss was Rs. 25 crores, the post
incident certificates produced along with the letter of 09.12.1999
of M/s Mukand Limited and the letter of M/s Flat Products dated
09.12.1999 attempting to make a remote connection with the
value of the damaged property do not inspire any confidence.
In any event, they are not invoices depicting the value of the
property at the time of its installation.
c. In any event, the surveyors, based on their expertise, having
assessed the value at Rs.20.09 Crores, there is no reason to
countenance the submission that the base figure on which the
depreciation should have been calculated was Rs. 28 crores.
c) Percentage of Depreciation: -
62. The next facet of the submission is that even if the value was to be
taken as Rs.20.09 Crores of the property, the depreciation should
have been computed at 32% as was mentioned in the report of the
surveyors dated 11.12.2001. No doubt in the 11.12.2001 report of
the joint surveyors while calculating depreciated value basis, 32%
was taken by the surveyors but even this report carried a number
of disclaimers. First of all, the surveyors state that the report is
issued without prejudice and they extract the interim survey report
of 04.02.1999. The surveyors set out in para 5.21 as follows:
“Loss Assessment on Depreciation Basis
(a) It is understood that Insured have not yet completed
repairs/reinstatement. The delay in the process was
Insured’s desired to have additional fund to proceed
with repairs, which of course is not warranted under
the policy.
(b) Insurer had several issued to be resolved before
advising us in November 2001 to proceed with final
assessment of loss.
(c) Pending reinstatement, we have assessed the
loss on depreciated value basis under summary of
assessed loss.”
63. As is clear from the above, the NIACL has several issues to
be resolved before advising the surveyors to proceed with the
assessment in November, 2001 and that pending reinstatement they
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 313
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
had assessed the loss on depreciated value basis. After this report of
11.12.2001, it was the Insured who tried to open the matter again by
writing a letter of 27.03.2002 stating that they had already installed a
new Cold Rolling Mill. Strangely, this was after the admitted letter of
28.06.2001 by M/s Flat Products stating that they are not in a position
to repair the 20 Hi Cold Rolling Mill since the experts have left the
company. However, by the letter of 27.03.2002, the Insured wanted
to treat the purported installation of 6 Hi Cold Rolling Mill as a valid
reinstatement to stake a claim on reinstatement value basis. This
claim of the NIACL is that particulars were sought for on 03.05.2002
and 24.06.2002 and the Insured on 09.07.2002 sought two weeks’
time to submit the information, but nothing was forthcoming, resulting
in the surveyors writing to the Insured again on 07.08.2002. It was
in this background that NIACL wrote the letter of 12.11.2002 in the
following terms:
“With reference to the above, we have noted that the
insured are unable to produce invoices to establish
the actual cost and age of the Mill affected in the said
occurrence.
As considerable time has elapsed and since the insured
has not been able to establish and substantiate their claim,
we may consider the claim on depreciated value basis
taking into account the maximum depreciation applicable
to such Mill. As such, we request you to let us have our
working on the above lines to enable us to put up the
matter to the competent authority for their consideration.”
64. Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Joy Basu for the Insured argued that this
letter was an attempt to goad the surveyors and that the response
of surveyors dated 07.12.2002 was a reluctant response from an
embarrassed surveyor. We are not prepared to countenance the
submission of Mr. Joy Basu, learned Senior Counsel. In fact, the
Insured is fortunate that there was no total repudiation for non supply
of relevant documents.
65. In fact the sequence of events shows the following; soon after the
claim, there was an interim survey of 04.02.1999 where minimum
loss on reinstatement value basis was estimated to be around
Rs.15 crores and maximum loss on reinstatement value basis was
estimated to be Rs.25 crores. An on-account payment of Rs. 7.20
314 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
crores was recommended. Thereafter, it is interesting to note that
from the 11.12.2001 report that between December, 1998 and July
1999 there were talks and inspections with suppliers/manufacturers
and the officials of the Insured. It further appears that the loss
assessment exercise was complete by July, 1999 and the report was
held back due to investigation by other agencies. This is clear from
the following preliminary portion of the 11.12.2001 report:
“1.00 INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions were received from New India Assurance
Co. Ltd. Regional Office II, New Delhi on 13.12.98 by
R.K. Singhal & Company Private Ltd. to survey and
assess the damage to Insured’s 20 HI Rolling Mill due
to a fire that broke out in Insured’s factory in the evening
of 12th December. Accordingly Mr. R.K. Singhal visited
Insured’s factory on 13th December 98 and carried out
a preliminary inspection of the subject machine. A.K.
Govil & Associates were subsequently co-opted as joint
surveyors by Regional Office vide their Facsimile of 16th
December. Their representatives visited Insured factory
on 17th December in order to carry out the necessary
inspection. Based on the physical inspection carried out
and limited information made available by the Insured till
then, the above surveyors submitted their join preliminary
survey report on 22nd December 1998. Subsequently
the underwriters appointed P.C. Gandhi & Associates as
another joint surveyors. The joint surveyors visited the
Insured factory jointly and severally on various dates and
carried out detailed physical inspection of the subject
machine besides carrying out protracted discussions
with the Insured official accompanied by Suppliers/
Manufacturers of the Mill.
Accordingly, matter was discussed with insurers
several occasions and loss assessment exercise was
almost complete by July -1999.
We understand that insurer had received some complaint
concerning subject loss and the matter went into
investigations by various agencies one after another.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 315
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
Insurer had also referred some matters to us and necessary
information and assistance were extended to the insurer
as well as concerned agencies.
Insurer have now advised us in the month of November
2001 to submit final loss assessment report.
In view of the above, this final survey report is issued
without prejudice and is based on documents submitted
by the insured and physical verification carried out by us.
We have in our “Interim Survey Report” dated 04.02.1999
discussed the following in details.
The above details are not being repeated and final survey
report may therefore be read in conjunction with our earlier
report.”
[Emphasis Supplied]
66. This is important because nowhere the 11.12.2001 report makes any
reference to the 28.06.2001 letter of M/s Flat Products expressing
their inability to reinstate the plant. There is a reference in Para 6.3
of the 11.12.2001 report to a meeting at the plant site on 19.06.2001
wherein the surveyors were given to believe that the Insured still
desires to reinstate the mill. However, this was on condition that
they will do so only after receiving further payment. Based on the
inspection and negotiations that were carried out up to July, 1999,
summary of assessed loss in para 5.23 was drawn up. This was
fixed for replacement/repair at Rs.19.55 Crores (after deductibles
like salvage etc). What is crucial is also that on this figure itself
depreciation at 32% was worked out. The base figure was arrived
at on reinstatement basis only and the same was adopted for the
depreciation basis also. No doubt, depreciation was worked at 32%.
This discussion is significant since the grievance of the Insured is
that the NIACL ought not to have written the letter of 12.11.2002. We
reject this contention. The NIACL was justified in writing the letter
of 12.11.2002 because after reviving their demand to reinstate the
plant, the Insured failed to furnish the documents required and even
admittedly the plant as allegedly reinstated was of 6 Hi Cold Rolling
Plant and not 20 Hi Cold Rolling Plant. In this scenario, one cannot
fault the NIACL for writing the letter of 12.11.2002 particularly when
the report of 11.12.2001 was before the new offer for reinstatement
316 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
by the Insured’s letter of 27.03.2002. Admittedly the report was based
on discussions that took place till July, 1999
67. In fact, the surveyors, after receiving the letter of 10.11.2002 should
have reassessed the value on depreciated value basis which would
be to value the loss as per the opening clause of the policy i.e.
arrive at the value of the property at the time of happening of its
destruction. This was not done and in the response of 07.12.2002
the base value was kept at Rs.20.09 Crores and applied depreciation
at 60% on the following justification:
“As the machine was running at its optimum capacity, we
are of the opinion that its residual life should not have
be less than 10 years i.e. residual life as per our above
calculation should be 40% thereby implying maximum
applicable depreciation of 60%”
68. The Insured has stood to gain by keeping the base figure at Rs.20.09
Crores as value for the depreciated basis also. That was a value
arrived at by the surveyors based on their expert assessment.
69. Dealing with the grievance that 60% depreciation had no basis, the
NCDRC called for an additional affidavit from NIACL. The NIACL in
the affidavit set out as follows:
“2. There are no written guidelines for computing
depreciation @ 4% per year. However, there is established
practice to calculate the depreciation in the case of old
machinery @ 5% per year upto maximum of 75% - 80%.
The Surveyors M/s. P.C. Gandhi and Associates assessed
the claim of M/s. Transpek Industries Ltd. by computing
the depreciation of 75%. In the case of M/s. Modem Denim
Ltd. the Surveyor applied the depreciation of 50% for 10
years usage considering 20 years machine line. Copy of
Surveyor’s letter dated 20th December, 2006 is Exhibit
R-1. The copy of the Surveyor’s report dated 19th March
2003 with respect to M/s. Transpek Industries Ltd. is
Exhibit R-2 hereto. The copy of the Surveyor report dated
25th February, 2003 with respect to Modem Denim Ltd.
is Exhibit R-3 hereto.”
70. The surveyors had offered justification in their response dated
07.12.2002 for providing depreciation at the rate of 60%. The
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 317
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
Additional Affidavit also clarifies the established practice. It should not
be forgotten that the base figure of Rs.20.09 crores was kept intact.
We set aside the finding of the NCDRC that the practice adopted in
the instant case was not a healthy practice by the NIACL. We uphold
the percentage of depreciation at 60%. We have not disturbed the
base value of Rs.20.09 crores as no arguments on that score were
advanced by the NIACL.
71. In view of the above discussion, the NIACL rightly ordered the
settlement of the claim on 03.01.2003 stating the loss amount as
Rs.7.88 Crores and ordering the balance amount of 2.88 crores be
paid after adjusting the on account payment.
Question No.(iii) - Applicability of the Judgment in Oswal Plastic
Industries (supra)
72. The only other question that remains to be answered is the argument
based on the judgment in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra). Firstly,
no factual foundation was placed to raise this submission. Even
in the Civil Appeals of the Insured the only ground was based on
the correct base figure and the applicable rates of depreciation.
In fact, the Insured in ground (D) in Civil Appeal 5242-5243 of
2009 admitted that the NCDRC rightly proceeded to determine the
compensation on depreciation basis. Ground (D) reads as follows:
“Because the Hon’ble National Commission rightly
proceeded on the premise that reinstatement of the
machine is no longer possible and that the compensation
to the appellant is therefore to be determined on
depreciation basis, i.e., value of the machine on the
date of loss.”
73. Further in the case of Oswal Plastic Industries (supra), as is
clear from para 2 of the said judgment, it appears the policy was on
reinstatement value basis. The complainant there claimed that he
had purchased the machinery to replace the damage in machinery
at the cost of 1,34,07,836/-. However, the surveyor had assessed
the loss on reinstatement basis 29,17,500/-. The NCDRC had
awarded compensation on depreciated basis. Before this Court,
the complainant relied on Clause 9 of the conditions, particularly
the second para, which Clause 9 was similar to the Clause 9 in the
present case. Even the Insurance Company contended as follows:
318 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
12. It is submitted that as rightly observed by the NCDRC
that the goods insured were to be replaced on “as is
basis” i.e., if the machinery is an old machinery, it is to be
replaced by an old machinery and therefore, as the actual
reinstatement has not been done by the complainant or
by the insurance company and the money is to be paid
to the insured on reinstatement basis, one has to find out
the value of the machinery on replacement basis i.e., the
value of the old machinery, which can be calculated only
through deducting the value of the depreciation from the
current value of the machinery.
74. It appears that even the Insured does not appear to have disputed
that the payment ought to have been on reinstatement basis and
the money is to be paid on reinstatement basis. Further, no clause
similar to the memorandum of reinstatement value clause appears
to have existed in Oswal Plastic Industries (supra).
75. In any event, independent of the above, no argument was raised in
the NCDRC and even in the memo of appeal here based on second
para of Clause 9. At the stage of final arguments in the appeals, we
are not prepared to permit this ambush argument by allowing the
Insured to mechanically rely on Oswal Plastic Industries (supra)
without establishing the factual similarity by laying an appropriate
foundation in the courts below. Hence, Oswal Plastic Industries
(supra) has no application to the facts of the present case.
IRDA Regulations
76. In so far as the argument based on Regulation 9(3) of the IRDA
(Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002, we find there
is no breach thereof. Regulation 9(3) of the IRDA reads as follows:
9. Claim procedure in respect of a general insurance
policy
xxx
(3) If an insurer, on the receipt of a survey report, finds that
it is incomplete in any respect, he shall require the surveyor
under intimation to the insured, to furnish an additional
report on certain specific issues as may be required by
the insurer. Such a request may be made by the insurer
within 15 days of the receipt of the original survey report.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 319
New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v.
M/s Tata Steel Ltd.
Provided that the facility of calling for an additional report
by the insurer shall not be resorted to more than once in
the case of a claim.
77. This clause has no application to the facts of the present case. As
has been illustrated above, the second report of 11.12.2001 was
based on negotiations held up to July, 1999. Thereafter there were
several developments including the Insured’s claim to first give up
reinstatement and then reintroduce the claim for reinstating the mill.
Several letters were written for furnishing crucial documents which
were not forthcoming from the Insured. Learned Senior Counsel,
Mr. Sanjay Jain contends that NIACL could have repudiated the
claim for non supply of documents. Be that as it may, we are not
called upon to decide that issue at this stage since NIACL has on
its own settled the claim by their letter of 03.01.2003. When NIACL,
on the facts of the present case, wrote the letter for assessing on
depreciation basis, it is not a case of a clarification being sought in
an incomplete report. Hence, on the facts of the present case, we
do not find any violation of the Regulation 9(3). In the absence of
any ambiguity we also do not find scope for applying the doctrine
of contra proferentem.
78. A feeble argument was sought to be advanced to the effect that the
depreciation should have been calculated on the sum insured. The
judgments in Sri Venkateswara Syndicate v. Oriental Insurance Co.
Ltd 2009 (8) SCC 507 and on Dharmendra Goel (supra) as well as
Sumit Kumar Saha v. Reliance General Insurance Company Ltd.,
(2019) 16 SCC 370 cited by the Insured have no application to the
facts of the present case. In Dharmendra Goel (supra) and Sumit
Kumar Saha (supra), the claimants never conceded for settlement
of the claim at a value lesser and different from the sum insured
as in the present case. Hence, there can be no case that the sum
insured should be taken as the basis for calculating depreciation.
79. As far as Sri Venkateswara Syndicate (supra) is concerned, this
Court had held that the insurance company cannot go on appointing
surveyors one after another so as to get a tailor-made report to the
satisfaction of the officer concerned of the insurance company; and
that if for any reason, the report of the surveyors is not acceptable,
the insurer has to give valid reason for not accepting the report. This
case has no applicability to the facts of the present matter.
320 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
80. In this case, as discussed hereinabove, the Insurer was fully justified
in writing the letter dated 12.11.2002 to the Surveyor requesting them
to re-assess the settlement amount. It was only the final response
by the surveyors on 07.12.2002 that gave a clear picture as to the
base figure and the applicable rates of the depreciation since the
method of settlement was to be the depreciation basis and not
reinstatement basis.
81. In view of the above, all the findings to the contrary recorded by
the NCDRC are held to be erroneous and are herewith set aside.
Conclusion
82. For the above reasons, we allow Civil Appeal No. 2759 of 2009 of
NIACL and set aside the order of the NCDRC in O.P. No. 233 of
2000 dated 05.08.2008. We hold that the claim was rightly settled
by the NIACL letter dated 03.01.2003 which determined the loss
amount payable at Rs.7.88 crores after applying 60% depreciation.
We dismiss Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 10001 of
2009 and Civil Appeal Nos. 5242-5243 of 2009 filed by the Insured-
respondent. Consequently, the Original Complaint OP No.233 of
2000 before the NCDRC will stand dismissed. No order as to costs.

obligation where the main provision does not apply – The tax
legislation recognises diverse relationships and modes in which

Plea of the Revenue relying upon the decision of this Court

Income Tax [2022] 9 SCR 1 that assessees would be liable
to deduct tax at source even if they are not making payment
or crediting the income to the account of the franchisee/
distributor:
Held: Rejected – When the obligation, and the time and manner
in which the tax is mandated by law to be deducted at source, is
fixed by the statute, the same cannot be shifted/altered/modified
or postponed on a concession in the court by the Revenue –
The concession may be granted, when permissible, by way of a
circular issued in accordance with s.119 – Decision in Singapore
Airlines Limited can not be read in the manner as suggested by
the Revenue. [Para 38]
Franchise agreement and distributorship agreement –
Distinction – Legal position of a distributor different from
agent – Distributor, an independent contractor:
Held: Legal position of a distributor, it is to be generally regarded
as different from that of an agent – The distributor buys goods
on his account and sells them in his territory – In such cases,
distributor is an independent contractor – Unlike an agent, he
does not act as a communicator or creator of a relationship
between the principal and a third party – Franchise agreements
are normally considered as sui generis, though they have
been in existence for some time – They provide a mechanism
whereby goods and services may be distributed – In franchise
agreements, the supplier or the manufacture, i.e. a franchisor,
appoints an independent enterprise as a franchisee through
whom the franchisor supplies certain goods or services – There
is a close relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee
because a franchisee’s operations are closely regulated, and this
possibly is a distinction between a franchise agreement and a
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1005
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
distributorship agreement – Franchise agreements are extremely
detailed and complex – Notwithstanding the strict restrictions
placed on the franchisees, the relationship may in a given case
be that of an independent contractor – Facts of each case and
the authority given by ‘principal’ to the franchisees matter and
are determinative – Further, an independent contractor is free
from control on the part of his employer, and is only subject to
the terms of his contract – But an agent is not completely free
from control, and the relationship to the extent of tasks entrusted
by the principal to the agent are fiduciary – As contract with an
independent agent depends upon the terms of the contract,
sometimes an independent contractor looks like an agent from
the point of view of the control exercisable over him, but on an
overview of the entire relationship the tests specified in clauses
(a) to (d) in paragraph 8 may not be satisfied – The distinction
is that independent contractors work for themselves, even when
they are employed for the purpose of creating contractual relations
with the third persons – An independent contractor is not required
to render accounts of the business, as it belongs to him and not
his employer. [Paras 39, 40]
Law relating to agency – Exclusion of servants and
independent contractors:
Held: ‘Agent’ denotes a relationship that is very different from that
existing between a master and his servant, or between a principal
and principal, or between an employer and his independent
contractor – Although servants and independent contractors are
parties to relationships in which one person acts for another, and
thereby possesses the capacity to involve them in liability, yet
the nature of the relationship and the kind of acts in question
are sufficiently different to justify the exclusion of servants and
independent contractors from the law relating to agency – Term
‘agent’ should be restricted to one who has the power of affecting
the legal position of his principal by the making of contracts, or
the disposition of the principal’s property; viz. an independent
contractor who may, incidentally, also affect the legal position of
his principal in other ways – This can be ascertained by referring
to and examining the indicia mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) in
paragraph 8 of this judgment – It is in the restricted sense in
which the term agent is used in Explanation (i) to s.194-H of the
Income Tax Act, 1961. [Para 41]
1006 [2024] 2 S.C.R.

Doctrine/Principles – Doctrine of presumption against
doubtful penalisation:
Held: The deduction of tax provisions should be programmatically
and realistically construed – In case of a legal or factual doubt in a
given case, the assessee can rely on the doctrine of presumption
against doubtful penalisation – Whether or not the said doctrine
should be applied will depend on facts and circumstances of the
case, including the past practice followed by the assessee and
accepted by the department – When there is apparent divergence
of opinion, to avoid litigation and pitfalls associated, it may be
advisable for the Central Board of Direct Taxes to clarify doubts
by issuing appropriate instruction/circular after ascertaining view
of the assesses and stakeholders. [Para 35]
Words and expressions – ‘power’; ‘authority’.

","Judgment
Sanjiv Khanna, J.
This common judgment decides the aforestated appeals preferred
by the Revenue and the assessees, who are cellular mobile
telephone service providers. The issue relates to the liability
to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Income
Tax Act, 19611 on the amount which, as per the Revenue, is a
commission payable to an agent by the assessees under the
franchise/ distributorship agreement between the assessees and
the franchisees/distributors. As per the assessees, neither are they
paying a commission or brokerage to the franchisees/distributors,
nor are the franchisees/distributors their agents. The High Courts
of Delhi and Calcutta have held that the assessees were liable
to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Act, whereas
the High Courts of Rajasthan, Karnataka and Bombay have held
that Section 194-H of the Act is not attracted to the circumstances
under consideration.
2. To avoid prolixity and repetition, we are not referring to the facts
and arguments in the beginning, and will preface our judgment by
reproducing Section 194-H of the Act and explaining its contours.
The relevant portion of Section 194-H reads as under:
“194-H. Commission or brokerage.— Any person, not
being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, who is
responsible for paying, on or after the 1st day of June,
2001, to a resident, any income by way of commission (not
being insurance commission referred to in Section 194-D)
or brokerage, shall, at the time of credit of such income
to the account of the payee or at the time of payment of
such income in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft
or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct income
tax thereon at the rate of five per cent:
Provided that no deduction shall be made under this
section in a case where the amount of such income or,
1 “The Act”, for short.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1009
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
as the case may be, the aggregate of the amounts of
such income credited or paid or likely to be credited or
paid during the financial year to the account of, or to, the
payee, does not exceed fifteen thousand rupees:
Provided further that an individual or a Hindu undivided
family, whose total sales, gross receipts or turnover from
the business or profession carried on by him exceed one
crore rupees in case of business or fifty lakh rupees in
case of profession during the financial year immediately
preceding the financial year in which such commission
or brokerage is credited or paid, shall be liable to deduct
income tax under this section.
Provided also that no deduction shall be made under this
section on any commission or brokerage payable by Bharat
Sanchar Nigam Limited or Mahanagar Telephone Nigam
Limited to their public call office franchisees.
xx xx xx”
3. Section 194-H of the Act imposes the obligation to deduct tax at
source, states that any person responsible for paying at the time of
credit or at the time of payment, whichever is earlier, to a resident any
income by way of commission or brokerage, shall deduct income tax
at the prescribed rate The expression “any person (...) responsible for
paying” is a term of art, defined vide Section 2042 of the Act. As per
2 204. Meaning of “person responsible for paying”.—For the purposes of the foregoing provisions of
this chapter and Section 285, the expression “person responsible for paying” means—
(i) in the case of payments of income chargeable under the head “Salaries” other than payments by
the Central Government or the Government of a State, the employer himself or, if the employer is
a company, the company itself, including the principal officer thereof;
(ii) in the case of payments of income chargeable under the head “Interest on securities” other than
payments made by or on behalf of the Central Government or the Government of a State, the local
authority, corporation or company, including the principal officer thereof;
(ii-a) in the case of any sum payable to a non-resident Indian, being any sum representing consider-
ation for the transfer by him of any foreign exchange asset, which is not a short-term capital asset,
the authorised person responsible for remitting such sum to the non-resident Indian or for crediting
such sum of his Non-resident (External) Account maintained in accordance with the Foreign Ex-
change Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999)], and any rules made thereunder;
(ii-b) in the case of furnishing of information relating to payment to a non-resident, not being a company,
or to a foreign company, of any sum, whether or not chargeable under the provisions of this Act,
the payer himself, or, if the payer is a company, the company itself including the principal officer
thereof;
(iii) in the case of credit or, as the case may be, payment of any other sum chargeable under the provi-
sions of this Act, the payer himself, or, if the payer is a company, the company itself including the
principal officer thereof.
1010 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the clause (iii) of Section 204, in the case of credit or in the case of
payment in cases not covered by clauses (i), (ii), (ii)(a), (ii)(b), “the
person responsible for paying” is the payer himself, or if the payer
is a company, the company itself and the principal officer thereof.
4. Explanation (i) to Section 194-H3 of the Act defines the expressions
‘commission’ or ‘brokerage’, as:
“Explanation. — For the purposes of this section, —
(i) “commission or brokerage” includes any payment
received or receivable, directly or indirectly, by a
person acting on behalf of another person for services
rendered (not being professional services) or for any
services in the course of buying or selling of goods
or in relation to any transaction relating to any asset,
valuable article or thing, not being securities;”
Payment is received when it is actually received or
paid. The payment is receivable when the amount
is actually credited in the books of the payer to the
account of the payee, though the actual payment
may take place in future. The payment received or
(iv) in the case of credit, or as the case may be, payment of any sum chargeable under the provisions
of this Act made by or on behalf of the Central Government or the Government of a State, the draw-
ing and disbursing officer or any other person, by whatever name called, responsible for crediting,
or as the case may be, paying such sum.
(v) in the case of a person not resident in India, the person himself or any person authorised by such
person or the agent of such person in India including any person treated as an agent under Sec-
tion 163.]
Explanation. —For the purposes of this section, —
(a) “non-resident Indian” and “foreign exchange asset” shall have the meanings assigned to them in
Chapter XII-A;
(b) “authorised person” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of Section 2 of the Foreign
Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999).
3 Sub-section 1 to Section 194-H of the Act can be interpreted as requiring deduction of tax at source on
commission and brokerage, even when the principal and agent relationship does not exist between the
parties. Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the Act can be read as expanding and widening the scope of
the provision of sub-section (1) to include in the ambit of brokerage and commission, payments made
by the principal to the agent, when covered under the four corners of the said explanation. We would
not like to pronounce on this aspect as it has not been argued by the Revenue, and it appears that the
requirement of relationship of principal and agent has been read into the main section. Further, applying
common or commercial parlance meaning to the terms ‘brokerage’ or ‘commission’, given the wide di-
vergence in which it is understood, would lead to confusion and has pitfalls. Deduction of Tax provisions
should be pragmatically and realistically construed, and not as enmeshes or by adopting catch-as-catch-
can approach. When doubts exist, the Central Board of Direct Taxes may examine this question and may
issue appropriate instructions/circular after ascertaining the views of assessees and other stakeholders.
The decision should be clear, and we trust and hope that an obligation, if imposed, will be prospective.
(See paragraph 34 of the judgment.)
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1011
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
receivable should be to a person acting on behalf of
another person. The words “another person” refers to
“the person responsible for paying”. The words “direct”
or “indirect” in Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the
Act are with reference to the act of payment. Without
doubt, the legislative intent to include “indirect” payment
ensures that the net cast by the section is plugged
and not avoided or escaped, albeit it does not dilute
the requirement that the payment must be on behalf
“the person responsible for paying”. This means that
the payment/credit in the account should arise from
the obligation of “the person responsible for paying”.
The payee should be the person who has the right to
receive the payment from “the person responsible for
paying”. When this condition is satisfied, it does not
matter if the payment is made “indirectly”.4
5. The services rendered by the agent to the principal, according to the
latter portion of Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the Act, should
not be in the nature of professional services. Further, Explanation
(i) to Section 194-H of the Act restricts application of Section 194-
H of the Act to the services rendered by the agent to the principal
in the course of buying and selling of goods, or in relation to any
transaction relating to any asset, valuable article, or thing, not being
securities. The latter portion of the Explanation (i) to Section 194-
H of the Act is a requirement and a pre-condition. It should not be
read as diminishing or derogating the requirement of the principal
and agent relationship between the payer and the recipient/payee.
6. It is settled by a series of judgments of this Court that the expression
‘acting on behalf of another person’ postulates the existence of a
legal relationship of principal and agent, between the payer and the
recipient/payee.5 The law of agency is technical. Whether in law the
relationship between the parties is that of principal-agent is answered
4 We are unable to visualize ‘indirect’ credit in the books of the payer to the account of the payee. Credit
entry is required even in cases of set-off. Nevertheless, this judgment should not be read as laying down
that ‘indirect’ credit in the books shall not require deduction of tax under Section 194-H of the Act.

Digital Supreme Court Reports
by applying Section 182 of the Contract Act, 18726. Therefore, the
obligation to deduct tax at source in terms of Section 194-H of the Act
arises when the legal relationship of principal-agent is established. It is
necessary to clarify this position, as in day to day life, the expression
‘agency’ is used to include a vast number of relationships, which are
strictly, not relationships between a principal and agent.
7. Section 182 of the Contract Act, defines the words ‘agent’ and
‘principal’ and reads as under:
“182. “Agent” and “principal” defined.— An “agent” is a
person employed to do any act for another, or to represent
another in dealings with third persons. The person for
whom such act is done, or who is so represented, is called
the “principal”.”
Agency in terms of Section 182 exists when the principal employs
another person, who is not his employee, to act or represent
him in dealings with a third person. An agent renders services
to the principal. The agent does what has been entrusted to him
by the principal to do. It is the principal he represents before
third parties, and not himself. As the transaction by the agent
is on behalf of the principal whom the agent represents, the
contract is between the principal and the third party. Accordingly
the agent, except in some circumstances, is not liable to the
third party.
8. Agency is therefore a triangular relationship between the principal,
agent and the third party. In order to understand this relationship,
one has to examine the inter se relationship between the principal
and the third party and the agent and the third party. When we
examine whether a legal relationship of a principal and agent exists,
the following factors/aspects should be taken into consideration:
(a) The essential characteristic of an agent is the legal power
vested with the agent to alter his principal’s legal relationship
with a third party and the principal’s co-relative liability to have
his relations altered.7
6 “Contract Act”, for short.
7 F.E. Dowrick, The Relationship of Principal and Agent, 17 MLR 24, 37 (1954).
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1013
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
(b) As the agent acts on behalf of the principal, one of the prime
elements of the relationship is the exercise of a degree of control
by the principal over the conduct of the activities of the agent. This
degree of control is less than the control exercised by the master on
the servant, and is different from the rights and obligations in case
of principal to principal and independent contractor relationship.
(c) The task entrusted by the principal to the agent should result
in a fiduciary relationship. The fiduciary relationship is the
manifestation of consent by one person to another to act on
his or her behalf and subject to his or her control, and the
reciprocal consent by the other to do so.8
(d) As the business done by the agent is on the principal’s account,
the agent is liable to render accounts thereof to the principal.
An agent is entitled to remuneration from the principal for the
work he performs for the principal.
9. At this stage, three other relevant aspects/considerations should
be noted. First is the difference between ‘power’ and ‘authority’.
The two terms though connected, are not synonymous. Authority
refers to a factual position, that is, the terms of contract between
the two parties. The power of the agent however, is not, strictly
speaking, conferred by the contract or by the principal but by the
law of agency. When a person gives authority to another person to
do the acts which bring the law of agency into play, then, the law
vests power with the agent to affect the principal’s legal relationship
with the third parties. The extent and existence of the power with
the agent is determined by public policy. The authority, as observed
above, refers to the factual situation. The second consideration is
that the primary task of an agent is to enter into contracts on behalf
of his principal, or to dispose of his principal’s property. The factors
mentioned in clauses (b) to (d) in paragraph 8 above flow, and are
indicia of this primary task. Clauses (b) to (d) of paragraph 8 are
useful as tests or standards to examine the true nature or character
of the relationship. Lastly, the substance of the relationship between
the parties, notwithstanding the nomenclature given by the parties
to the relationship, is of primary importance. The true nature of the
relationship is examined by reference to the functions, responsibility
8 Restatement (Third) of Agency (American Law Institute Publishers 2007).
1014 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and obligations of the so-called agent to the principal and to the
third parties.
10. An agent is distinct from a servant, in that an agent is subject to
less control than a servant, and has complete, or almost complete
discretion as to how to perform an undertaking. As Seavey said, ‘‘a
servant (...) is an agent under more complete control than is a non-
servant’’.9 The difference is “in the degree of control rather than in
the acts performed. The servant sells primarily his services measured
by time; the agent his ability to produce results.”10 This distinction
can be criticised, for servants may have very wide discretion, and
may not really be subject to control at all in practice, while agents
may have their power to act circumscribed by detailed instructions.11
11. This Court in Bhopal Sugar Industries Limited v. Sales Tax Officer,
Bhopal12, has expounded the difference between principal-agent and
principal-principal relationship, in the following words:-
“5. … the essence of the matter is that in a contract of sale,
title to the property passes on to the buyer on delivery of the
goods for a price paid or promised. Once this happens the
buyer becomes the owner of the property and the seller has no
vestige of title left in the property. The concept of a sale has,
however, undergone a revolutionary change, having regard
to the complexities of the modern times and the expanding
needs of the society, which has made a departure from the
doctrine of laissez faire by including a transaction within the
fold of a sale even though the seller may by virtue of an
agreement impose a number of restrictions on the buyer, e.g.
fixation of price, submission of accounts, selling in a particular
area or territory and so on. These restrictions per se would
not convert a contract of sale into one of agency, because
in spite of these restrictions the transaction would still be a
sale and subject to all the incidents of a sale. A contract of
agency, however, differs essentially from a contract of sale
inasmuch as an agent after taking delivery of the property

[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1015
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
does not sell it as his own property but sells the same as
the property of the principal and under his instructions and
directions. Furthermore, since the agent is not the owner of
the goods, if any loss is suffered by the agent he is to be
indemnified by the principal. This is yet another dominant
factor which distinguishes an agent from a buyer—pure and
simple. In Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 1, 4th Edn., in
para 807 at p. 485, the following observations are made:
“807. Rights of agent. —The relation of principal
and agent raises by implication a contract on
the part of the principal to reimburse the agent
in respect of all expenses, and to indemnify him
against all liabilities, incurred in the reasonable
performance of the agency, provided that such
implication is not excluded by the express terms
of the contract between them, and provided
that such expenses and liabilities are in fact
occasioned by his employment.”
12. The aforesaid judgment in the context of distinction between a
contract of sale and contract of agency observes that the agent
is authorised to sell or buy on behalf of the principal, whereas the
essence of contract of sale is the transfer of title of goods for the
price paid or promised to be paid. In case of an agency to sell, the
agent who sells them to the third parties, sells them not as his own
property, but as a property of the principal, who continues to be the
owner of the goods till the sale. The transferee is the debtor and
liable to account for the price to be paid to the principal, and not to
the agent for the proceeds of the sale. An agent is entitled to his
fee or commission from the principal.
13. This distinction and test was referred to by this Court in Commissioner
of Income Tax, Ahmedabad and Others v. Ahmedabad Stamp
Vendors Association13, which is a case relating to Section 194-H
of the Act. This Court had approved the decision of the High Court
in Ahmedabad Stamp Vendors Association v. Union of India14.

of Director, Prasar Bharati v. Commissioner of Income Tax,
Thiruvananthapuram15, this Court has observed that the explanation
appended to Section 194-H of the Act defining the expression
‘commission or brokerage’ is an inclusive definition giving wide
meaning to the expression ‘commission’. The second decision is
in the case of Singapore Airlines Limited v. Commissioner of
Income Tax, Delhi16, which we shall refer to subsequently in some
detail as to its exact purport and ratio. However, at this stage, we
would like to examine in some detail commercial relationships in
the nature of an independent contractor, that are legally, principal
to principal dealings.

highlights the principles and the complexities involved in determining
the correct nature of the legal relationship between a principal and
an agent. Law permits individuals to enter into complex contracts
incorporating multiple rights and obligations. The relationships
between contacting parties have become multi-dimensional, which
may not strictly fall within an employer-employee, principal-agent or
principal-principal relationship. A singular contract may create different
legal relationships and obligations. Independent contractors on
occasion act for themselves, and at other times may be creating legal
relations between their employers and third persons. For example,
a solicitor may start by giving advice (independent contractor), and
then as a consequence make a contract for his employer with another
person (agent).
15. In Labreche v. Harasymiw17, Valin J. delineated the question of
what an agency involves, stating that: (i) it refers to the power of the
agent to affect the principal’s position. However, this is not the sole
test, though it still remains one of the main criteria in determining
whether someone is an agent. There are several features in the
definition of an agent18. There can be several situations where one
person represents or acts for another, but this does not create the
relationship of principal and agent. It is only when the representation

[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1017
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
or action on another’s behalf affects the latter’s legal position, that
is to say his rights against, or his liability towards, other people, that
the law of agency applies; (ii) the second feature is the importance
of the way in which law regards the relationship which is created.
The effect of the law is that it regulates the way in which parties
conduct themselves. The conduct of the parties is considered in
terms of law, regardless of the language or nomenclature used by the
parties. The true factual position must be investigated to determine
whether a relationship of agency has come into existence between
a set of parties or individuals.
16. The significant observation in the aforesaid judgment is that all kinds
of interactions with third parties or interested parties, resulting from
the introduction of the third parties with one who wishes a particular
undertaking to be performed, may not be a result of an agency. For
instance, a retail dealer or supplier of goods, obtains goods from
a wholesale supplier or a manufacturer for subsequent resale to
retail customers or suppliers who, in turn, deals with retail dealers
or shopkeepers. Such ‘middlemen’ are sometimes referred to as
‘agents’, when in fact they are franchisees of the manufacturer or
supplier, or are distributors of the manufactures’ goods, perhaps
with a ‘sole agency’ or special dealership for his goods. Such
‘agents’ can be real buyers, acting as principals on their own behalf.
Consequently, they are not liable to the manufacturer or supplier in
the way an agent might be for failure of duty, nor do their contracts
with other parties – whether it be suppliers, retail dealers or individual
customers – hold the party who sold to them, liable, for any breach
including misrepresentation or sale of defective goods. The seller’s
contractual or tortious liability is different from the manufacturer’s
liability on account of warranty/guarantee, statutory liability or even
obligation to a third party who purchases the goods or avails services
from/through the independent contractor. An agent renders service
to the principal, who he/she represents, and therefore the principal,
and not the agent, is liable to the third parties. Further, the money
received by an independent contractor from his customers will belong
to the independent contractor and not to the party who sold to him.
The money will be a part of such independent contractor’s property
in the event of his bankruptcy or liquidation. This may be the case
even if the contract of sale is one of ‘sale or return’. It is important
to avoid confusion, by applying the legal tests, that may arise where
1018 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the functions of the ‘buyer’ – described as an ‘agent’ – is really as
that of a ‘middleman’, and the necessary elements for creation of
principal and an agent relationship are absent. Two level commercial
transaction can result in an tripartite arrangement/agreement with
respective rights and obligations, without any of the two parties
having principal-agent relationship.
17. Clause (d) in paragraph 8 observes that the agent is liable to render
accounts to the principal as the business done by the agent is on
principal’s account. The agent is entitled to remuneration from the
principal for the work he performs. To decide whether a contracting
party acts for himself as an independent contractor, we may examine
whether in the course of work, he intends to make profits for himself,
or is entitled to receive prearranged remuneration. If the party is
concerned about acting for himself and making the maximum profits
possible, he is usually regarded as a buyer, or an independent
contractor and not as an agent of the principal. This would be true
even when certain terms and conditions have been fixed relating
to the manner in which the seller conducts his business. We shall
subsequently further elucidate on the characteristics of an independent
contractor, and differentiate them from the principal-agent relationship.
18. We now turn to the facts of the present case. The assessees, as
noticed above, are cellular mobile telephone service providers in
different circles as per the licence granted to them under Section
4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 188519 by the Department of
Telecommunications20, Government of India. To carry on business,
the assessees have to comply with the licence conditions and
the rules and regulations of the DoT and the Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India.21 Cellular mobile telephone service providers
have wide latitude to select the business model they wish to adopt
in their dealings with third parties, subject to statutory compliances
being made by the operators. As per the business model adopted by
the telecom companies, the users can avail post-paid and prepaid
connections. In the present case, we are only concerned with the
business operations under the prepaid model.

20 ‘DoT’, for short.
21 ‘TRAI’, for short.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1019
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
19. Under the prepaid business model, the end-users or customers
are required to pay for services in advance, which can be done
by purchasing recharge vouchers or top-up cards from the
retailers. For a new prepaid connection, the customers or end-
users purchase a kit, called a start-up pack, which contains a
Subscriber Identification Mobile card22, commonly known as SIM
card, and a coupon of the specified value as advance payment
to avail the telecom services.
20. The assessees have entered into franchise or distribution agreements
with several parties, the terms and conditions of which we would
refer to subsequently. It is the case of the assessees that they sell
the start-up kits and recharge vouchers of the specified value at a
discounted price to the franchisee/distributors. The discounts are
given on the printed price of the packs. This discount, as per the
assessees, is not a ‘commission or brokerage’ under Explanation
(i) to Section 194-H of the Act. The Revenue, on the other hand,
submits that the difference between ‘discounted price’ and ‘sale
price’ in the hands of the franchisee/distributors being in the nature
of ‘commission or brokerage’ is the income of the franchisee/
distributors, the relationship between the assessees and the
franchisee/distributor is in the nature of principal and agent, and
therefore, the assesses are liable to deduct tax at source under
Section 194-H of the Act.
21. In order to decide the dispute in question, we would like to refer to
some of the relevant clauses of the franchisee/distributor agreement
between Bharti Airtel Limited and the franchisee/distributors, which
read as under23:
Bharti Airtel Limited

22. As per the agreement, the franchisee/distributor is appointed for
marketing of prepaid services and for appointing the retailer or
1028 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
outlets for sale promotion. It is pertinent to note that the retailers
or outlets for sale promotion are appointed by the franchisee/
distributor and not the assessee. The franchisees/distributors have
agreed not to undertake activities mentioned in the agreement
for any other competitive cellular mobile telephone service
provider in the business. The franchisees/distributors have to
comply with statutory, regulatory and municipal permissions
while conducting the business. The franchisees/distributors
have agreed to indemnify and keep indemnified the assessee
against any and all costs, expenses and charges imposed on
the assessee because of any action by a statutory, regulatory
or municipal authority due to non-compliance by the franchisee/
distributor. The franchisee/ distributor has to maintain a suitable
establishment for the conduct of business and performance
of obligations. While doing so, the franchisee/distributor shall
conform and adhere to the policies communicated to it from
time to time by the assessee. The franchisee/distributor shall
employ adequate employees for performing its obligations, and
all contractual and statutory payments, including wages, are to
be paid by the franchisee/distributor. The assessee can, if it so
desires, call upon the franchisee/distributor to make alterations,
modifications in furniture, air conditioning equipment etc., as
required and necessary and mutually agreed. Costs of such
alternations and distributions are to be borne by the franchisee/
distributor.
23. The franchisee/distributor has to maintain proper and sufficient
quantities of prepaid start-up packs and recharge coupons to
meet the market requirements. The franchisee/distributor shall
follow the guidelines and directions issued by the assessee from
time to time. At no point of time, the right, title, or interest in the
prepaid cards shall pass on to the franchisee/distributor. All rights,
title ownership and property rights in the cards shall rest with the
assessee. The franchisee/distributor shall be solely responsible
and liable for safety and storage of prepaid start-up kits, recharge
cards and other material. The assessee will not be liable for any
loss, pilferage or damage to the pre-paid coupons/starter-kits. The
franchisee/ distributor is to indemnify the assessee for any loss
caused on this account. The franchisee/distributor is to insure the
prepaid start-up kits/ recharge coupons. The liability for any loss
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1029
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
or damage due to fire, burglary, theft etc. is that of the franchisee/
distributor.
24. On termination of the agreement, the franchisee/distributor shall
continue its operation till the effective date of termination mentioned
in the notice. Upon termination, the franchisee/distributor is required
to return all advertising and promotional material, etc. to the assessee
by the effective date of termination. Further, the assessee is not
liable to the franchisee/distributor or any other party for any loss of
profits or compensation or prospective profits or on account of any
expenditure, etc. in the event of termination.
25. The assessee is to review the minimum subscriptions/targets for
prepaid services taking into account market development and potential
and other relevant factors. The franchisee/distributor is to employ a
fully trained service staff, who have undergone training in accordance
to the standards set out by the assessee. The franchisee/distributor
will be responsible to collect all necessary agreement/contract forms
and other related forms, after obtaining signatures of the customers
on the said forms. These forms, duly completed in all respects and
signed by the customers, will be forwarded to the assessee for its
verification and record.
26. The franchisee’s/distributor’s price and payment for services will
be specified by the assessee from time to time. The rates can be
varied during the terms of the agreement at the discretion of the
assessee and such variation is to be intimated to the franchisee/
distributor. All tax liabilities in connection with, or arising out of, the
transactions pertaining to the agreement shall be the responsibility
of the franchisee/distributor.
27. The trademarks, logos, trade names or identifying marks and
slogans used by the assessee, whether registered or not, are
exclusive property of the assessee or the affiliated companies.
The use of such marks, logos etc. will be in accordance with the
guidelines issued by the assessee. As long as the agreement is in
force, but not thereafter, the franchisee/distributor shall identify itself
as an authorised franchisee, but shall not use trademarks, logos,
tradenames, as part of its proprietorship name/corporate/ partnership
name or otherwise. The franchisee/distributor is entitled to use its
logo on the side door at its outlets and on its memos and official
business documents towards the services effected from the outlet.
1030 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
28. On the question of actual business financial model adopted and
followed, it is an admitted position that the franchisees/distributors
were required to pay in advance the price of the welcome kit
containing the SIM card, recharge vouchers, top-up cards, e-tops,
etc. The abovementioned price was a discounted one. Such discounts
were given on the price printed on the pack of the prepaid service
products. The franchisee/distributor paid the discounted price
regardless of, and even before, the prepaid products being sold and
transferred to the retailers or the actual consumer. The franchisee/
distributor was free to sell the prepaid products at any price below
the price printed on the pack. The franchisee/distributor determined
his profits/income.
29. The Revenue has highlighted that the prepaid SIM cards were not the
property of franchisee/distribution and no right, title or interest was
transferred to them. These were always to remain the property of the
assessee. This is correct, but it is equally true that this is a mandate
and requirement of the licence issued to the assessee by the DoT.
In actual practice, the right to use the SIM card and its possession
is handed over and given to the end-user, that is, the customer who
installs the SIM card in his phone to avail the telecommunication
services. Similarly, the franchisees/distributors are to ensure that the
post-paid customers/end-users fill up the form as prescribed along
with the documents which are given and submitted to the assessee.
These are mandates prescribed by the licence issued by the DoT
to the assessees. The contractual obligations of the distributors/
franchisees, do not reflect a fiduciary character of the relationship,
or the business being done on the principal’s account.
30. The franchisees/distributors earn their income when they sell the
prepaid products to the retailer or the end-user/customer. Their
profit consists of the difference between the sale price received by
them from the retailer/end-user/customer and the discounted price
at which they have ‘acquired’ the product. Though the discounted
price is fixed or negotiated between the assessee and the franchisee/
distributor, the sale price received by the franchisee/ distributor is
within the sole discretion of the franchisee/distributor. The assessee
has no say in this matter.
31. It is not the case of the Revenue that the tax at source under Section
194-H of the Act is to be deducted on the difference between the
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1031
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
printed price and the discounted price. This cannot be the case as
the Revenue cannot insist that the franchisee/distributor must sell
the products at the printed price and not at a figure or price below
the printed price. The obligation to deduct tax at source is fixed
by the statute itself, that is, on the date of actual payment by any
mode, or at the time when income is credited to the account of the
franchisee/distributor, whichever is earlier. In the context of the present
case, the income of the franchisee/distributor, being the difference
between the sale price received by the franchisee/distributor and the
discounted price, is paid or credited to the account of the franchisee/
distributor when he sells the prepaid product to the retailer/end-
user/customer. The sale price and accordingly the income of the
franchisee/distributor is determined by the franchisee/distributor and
the third parties. Accordingly, the assessee does not, at any stage,
either pay or credit the account of the franchisee/distributor with the
income by way of commission or brokerage on which tax at source
under Section 194-H of the Act is to be deducted.
32. Faced with the above situation, the Revenue has relied upon the
use of the expression “payment received or receivable directly or
indirectly by a person acting on behalf of the other person”, that is, ‘the
principal’. It is argued that even if the franchisee/distributor receives
payment in the form of income from the retailer/end-user/customer,
it would require deduction of tax at source as payment received or
receivable, directly or indirectly, is to be subjected to deduction of
tax. In support of the argument, reliance is placed upon decision in
the case of Singapore Airlines Limited (supra).
33. The decision in Singapore Airlines Limited (supra) is required to
be understood in the context of the contract in the said case, which
was in terms of the rules/agreement set up by the International
Airport Transport Association24. IATA would fix a ceiling price,
and the price an airline could charge from its customers with a
discretion to the airlines to sell their tickets at a net fare lower
than the base fare but not higher. The air carriers were required
to furnish a fare list to the Director General of Civil Aviation. The
arrangement between the airlines and travel agents was covered
24 ‘IATA’, for short.
1032 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
by the Passenger Sales Agency Agreement25, which would set
out the conditions under which the travel agent carried out sale of
tickets along with other ancillary services. The travel agents were
entitled to 7% commission on sale of the tickets for its services
as the standard commission based on the price bar set by the
IATA. The airlines were deducting tax at source under Section
194-H of the Act on the 7% commission. In addition to the 7%
commission, the travel agents were also entitled to additional/
supplementary commission on the tickets sold by them. The
additional/supplementary commission and the amount at which
the tickets were sold were computed by the travel agents and
transmitted to the billing and settlement plan (BSP). The BSP,
functioning under the aegis of the IATA, managed, inter alia,
logistics vis-à-vis payments, and acted as a forum for agents and
airlines to examine details pertaining to the sale of the flight tickets.
33.1 This Court examined the operation of the BSP where the
financial data regarding sale of tickets was stored. The BSP
agglomerated the data from multiple transactions. Thereupon,
this data was transmitted either bimonthly or twice a month to
the airlines. It is on the basis of this data that the airlines/air
carriers were required to pay the additional commission to the
travel agents. These are the striking distinguishing features in
Singapore Airlines Limited (supra) case.
33.2 Having considered the aforesaid mechanism and the nature
of relationship between a principal and an agent26, this Court
found considerable merit in the argument of the Revenue
that the airlines/ air carriers utilised the BSP to discern the
amount earned as additional/supplementary commission and
accordingly arrive at the income earned by the agent to deduct
tax at source, in accordance with the provisions of Section 194-
H of the Act. If the aforesaid mechanism is understood, then
it is not difficult to appreciate and understand the conclusion
arrived at by this Court in the said case.
25 ‘PSA’, for short.
26 As stated above the airlines were deducting tax at source under Section 194-H on the 7% commission
(standard commission). The dispute only related to whether the airlines were liable to deduct tax at
source on the additional commission (supplementary commission).
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1033
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
33.3 Thus, the question whether there was relationship of principal
and agent was not in dispute, but nevertheless the assessees
in the said case disputed liability to deduct tax at source on the
additional/supplementary commission. However, the judgment
does refer to the difference between the legal relationship of
master and servant, principal and agent, and between principal
and principal. In this context, reference is made to the statement
of law in Halsbury’s Law of England27, which reads:
“The difference between the relations of master and
servant and of principal and agent may be said to be this:
a principal has the right to direct what work the agent has
to do: but a master has the further right to direct how the
work is to be done.”
xx xx xx
“An agent is to be distinguished on the one hand from a
servant, and on the other from an independent contractor.
A servant acts under the direct control and supervision
of his master, and is bound to conform to all reasonable
orders given him in the course of his work; an independent
contractor, on the other hand, is entirely independent of
any control or interference and merely undertakes to
produce a specified result, employing his own means to
produce that result. An agent, though bound to exercise
his authority in accordance with all lawful instructions
which may be given to him from time to time by his
principal, is not subject in its exercise to the direct control
or supervision of the principal. An agent, as such is not
a servant, but a servant is generally for some purposes
his master’s implied agent, the extent of the agency
depending upon the duties or position of the servant.”
34. We have already expounded on the main provision of Section 194-
H of the Act, which fixes the liability to deduct tax at source on the
‘person responsible to pay’ – an expression which is a term of art
– as defined in Section 204 of the Act and the liability to deduct tax
at source arises when the income is credited or paid by the person
27 Vol. 22, p. 113, ¶ 192 and Vol. 1, at p. 193, Article 345.
1034 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
responsible for paying.28 The expression “direct or indirect” used
in Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the Act is no doubt meant
to ensure that “the person responsible for paying” does not dodge
the obligation to deduct tax at source, even when the payment is
indirectly made by the principal-payer to the agent-payee. However,
deduction of tax at source in terms of Section 194-H of the Act is
not to be extended and widened in ambit to apply to true/genuine
business transactions, where the assessee is not the person
responsible for paying or crediting income. In the present case, the
assessees neither pay nor credit any income to the person with
whom he has contracted. Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the
Act, by using the word “indirectly”, does not regulate or curtail the
manner in which the assessee can conduct business and enter
into commercial relationships. Neither does the word “indirectly”
create an obligation where the main provision does not apply. The
tax legislation recognises diverse relationships and modes in which
commerce and trade are conducted, albeit obligation to tax at source
arises only if the conditions as mentioned in Section 194-H of the
Act are met and not otherwise. This principle does not negate the
compliance required by law.
35. Deduction of tax at source is a substantial source of the direct tax
revenue. The ease of collection and recovery is obvious. Deduction
and deposit of tax at source checks evasion and non-payment of
tax. It expands the tax base. However, the assessee as a deductor
is not paying tax on his/her income, and collects and pays tax
otherwise payable by the third party. Liability of the third party to pay
tax when not deducted remains unaffected. Failure to deduct tax at
source has serious and quasi-penal consequences for an assessee.
The deduction of tax provisions should be programmatically and
realistically construed, and not as enmeshes or by adopting catch-
as-catch-can approach. In case of a legal or factual doubt in a given
case, the assessee can rely on the doctrine of presumption against
doubtful penalisation.29 Whether or not the said doctrine should
28 See ¶ 5 of the judgment.
29 See Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Sunil Krishna Khaitan and Others, [2022] 18 SCR 987 :
(2023) 2 SCC 643. However, in the present case doctrine of presumption against doubtful penalisation
is not applicable. The assessees were earlier deducting tax at source under Section 194-H of the Act,
though the amount on which tax was being deducted is unclear. On legal opinion they stopped deducting
tax at source.
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1035
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
be applied30, will depend on facts and circumstances of the case,
including the past practice followed by the assessee and accepted
by the department. When there is apparent divergence of opinion,
to avoid litigation and pitfalls associated, it may be advisable for the
Central Board of Direct Taxes to clarify doubts by issuing appropriate
instruction/circular after ascertaining view of the assesses and
stakeholders.31 In addition to enhancing revenue and ensuring tax
compliance, an equally important aim/objective of the Revenue is
to reduce litigation. The instructions/circular, if and when issued,
should be clear, and when justified – require the obligation to be
made prospective.
36. Notably, the Delhi High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v.
Singapore Airlines Ltd.32 had held that tax under Section 194-H
of the Act is not required to be deducted on the discounted tickets
sold by the airlines/air carriers through travel agents. Revenue did
not challenge the decision of the Delhi High Court to this extent and
therefore, this dictum attained finality. As noted, it is not the case
of the Revenue that tax is to be deducted when payment is made
by the distributors/franchisees to the mobile service providers. It is
also not the case of the revenue that tax is to be deducted under
Section 194-H of the Act on the difference between the maximum
retail price income of the distributors/ franchisees and the price paid
by the distributors/franchisees to the assessees. The assessees
are not privy to the transactions between distributors/franchisees
and third parties. It is, therefore, impossible for the assessees to
deduct tax at source and comply with Section 194-H of the Act, on
the difference between the total/sum consideration received by the
istributors/ franchisees from third parties and the amount paid by
the distributors/ franchisees to them.
37. The argument of the Revenue that assessees should periodically
ask for this information/data and thereupon deduct tax at source
should be rejected as far-fetched, imposing unfair obligation and
inconveniencing the assesses, beyond the statutory mandate. Further,
it will be willy-nilly impossible to deduct, as well as make payment
30 This would include the question of prospective or retrospective application.
31 We do acknowledge that the Central Board of Direct Taxes has on several occasions quelled doubts and
issued instructions/circulars.
32 (2009) 319 ITR 29.
1036 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of the tax deducted, within the timelines prescribed by law, as these
begin when the amount is credited in the account of the payee by
the payer or when payment is received by the payee, whichever is
earlier. The payee receives payment when the third party makes the
payment. This payment is not the payment received or payable by
the assessee as the principal. The distributor/franchisee is not the
trustee who is to account for this payment to the assessee as the
principal. The payment received is the gross income or profit earned
by the distributor/franchisee. It is the income earned by distributor/
franchisee as a result of its efforts and work, and not a remuneration
paid by the assessee as a cellular mobile telephone service provider.
38. We must, therefore, reject the argument of the Revenue relying upon
the decision of this Court in Singapore Airlines Limited (supra)
that assessees would be liable to deduct tax at source even if the
assessees are not making payment or crediting the income to the
account of the franchisee/distributor. When the obligation, and the
time and manner in which the tax is mandated by law to be deducted
at source, is fixed by the statute, the same cannot be shifted/altered/
modified or postponed on a concession in the court by the Revenue.
The concession may be granted, when permissible, by way of a
circular issued in accordance with Section 119 of the Act. We do not
think that the decision in Singapore Airlines Limited (supra) can
be read in the manner as suggested by the Revenue.
39. Coming back to the legal position of a distributor, it is to be generally
regarded as different form that of an agent. The distributor buys
goods on his account and sells them in his territory. The profit
made is the margin of difference between the purchase price and
the sale price. The reason is, that the distributor in such cases is
an independent contractor. Unlike an agent, he does not act as a
communicator or creator of a relationship between the principal and
a third party. The distributor has rights of distribution and is akin
to a franchisee. Franchise agreements are normally considered
as sui generis, though they have been in existence for some time.
Franchise agreements provide a mechanism whereby goods and
services may be distributed. In franchise agreements, the supplier
or the manufacture, i.e. a franchisor, appoints an independent
enterprise as a franchisee through whom the franchisor supplies
certain goods or services. There is a close relationship between
a franchisor and a franchisee because a franchisee’s operations
[2024] 2 S.C.R. 1037
Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 57, Kolkata and Another
are closely regulated, and this possibly is a distinction between a
franchise agreement and a distributorship agreement. Franchise
agreements are extremely detailed and complex. They may
relate to distribution franchises, service franchises and production
franchises. Notwithstanding the strict restrictions placed on the
franchisees – which may require the franchisee to sell only the
franchised goods, operate in a specific location, maintain premises
which are required to comply with certain requirements, and even
sell according to specified prices – the relationship may in a given
case be that of an independent contractor. Facts of each case and
the authority given by ‘principal’ to the franchisees matter and are
determinative.
40. An independent contractor is free from control on the part of his
employer, and is only subject to the terms of his contract. But an
agent is not completely free from control, and the relationship to the
extent of tasks entrusted by the principal to the agent are fiduciary.
As contract with an independent agent depends upon the terms of
the contract, sometimes an independent contractor looks like an
agent from the point of view of the control exercisable over him,
but on an overview of the entire relationship the tests specified in
clauses (a) to (d) in paragraph 8 may not be satisfied. The distinction
is that independent contractors work for themselves, even when
they are employed for the purpose of creating contractual relations
with the third persons. An independent contractor is not required
to render accounts of the business, as it belongs to him and not
his employer.
41. Thus, the term ‘agent’ denotes a relationship that is very different
from that existing between a master and his servant, or between a
principal and principal, or between an employer and his independent
contractor. Although servants and independent contractors are parties
to relationships in which one person acts for another, and thereby
possesses the capacity to involve them in liability, yet the nature of the
relationship and the kind of acts in question are sufficiently different
to justify the exclusion of servants and independent contractors from
the law relating to agency. In other words, the term ‘agent’ should be
restricted to one who has the power of affecting the legal position
of his principal by the making of contracts, or the disposition of
the principal’s property; viz. an independent contractor who may,
incidentally, also affect the legal position of his principal in other ways.
1038 [2024] 2 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
This can be ascertained by referring to and examining the indicia
mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) in paragraph 8 of this judgment. It is
in the restricted sense in which the term agent is used in Explanation
(i) to Section 194-H of the Act.
42. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the assessees
would not be under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on
the income/profit component in the payments received by the
distributors/franchisees from the third parties/customers, or while
selling/transferring the pre-paid coupons or starter-kits to the
distributors. Section 194-H of the Act is not applicable to the facts
and circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the appeals filed by
the assessee – cellular mobile service providers, challenging the
judgments of the High Courts of Delhi and Calcutta are allowed and
these judgments are set aside. The appeals filed by the Revenue
challenging the judgments of High Courts of Rajasthan, Karnataka
and Bombay are dismissed. There would be no orders as to cost.
Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

1. Leave granted.
2. In this appeal, the issue involved is about the legality and validity of
the order of termination of the arbitral proceedings under clause (c) of
sub-section (2) of Section 32 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 (for short, ‘the Arbitration Act’) passed by the Arbitral Tribunal.
FACTUAL ASPECTS
3. A brief reference to the factual aspects will be necessary to
appreciate the issue. The first appellant, Dani Wooltex Corporation,
is a partnership firm that owned certain land in Mumbai. The first
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 765
Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
respondent, Sheil Properties (for short, ‘Sheil’), a private limited
company, was engaged in real estate development. The second
respondent, Marico Industries (for short, ‘Marico’), is also a limited
company in the consumer goods business. A part of the first
appellant’s property was permitted to be developed by Sheil under
the Development Agreement dated 11th August 1993 (for short, ‘the
Agreement’). A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed
by and between the first appellant and Marico, by which the first
appellant agreed to sell another portion of its property to Marico.
Under the MOU, Marico was given the benefit of a certain quantity of
FSI/TDR. Marico issued a public notice inviting objections, to which
Sheil submitted an objection and stated that any transaction between
the first appellant and Marico would be subject to the Agreement. The
dispute between the first appellant and Sheil led Sheil to institute a
suit (Suit no.2541 of 2006) for the specific performance of the MOU
as modified by the alleged consent terms. The first appellant and
Marico were parties to the said suit. Marico also filed a suit (Suit
no.2116 of 2011) against the first appellant herein, and Sheil was
also made a party defendant to the suit. A consensus was reached
amongst the three parties, and a senior Member of the Bar was
appointed as the sole Arbitrator. The order of appointment of the
sole Arbitrator was passed on 13th October 2011 in the suit filed by
Marico. The order records that the dispute in the suit was referred
to the arbitration. On 17th November 2011, the suit filed by Sheil
was disposed of by referring the dispute in the said suit to the same
sole Arbitrator. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal had to deal with the claims
filed by Sheil and Marico, both against the first appellant. Both Sheil
and Marico filed their respective statements of claim. It appears that
the arbitral proceeding based on Marico’s claim was heard earlier,
culminating in an award on 6th May 2017. For whatever reasons, the
arbitral proceeding based on the claim filed by Sheil did not proceed.
4. The first appellant addressed a communication to the Arbitral Tribunal
on 26th November 2019, followed by another communication dated 7th
January 2020 requesting the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss the claim of
Sheil on the ground that the company had abandoned the claim. In
response, the Arbitral Tribunal fixed a meeting on 11th March 2020.
As Sheil did not attend the meeting, the next meeting was fixed
on 18th March 2020. The meeting scheduled for 18th March 2020
was not held. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the next meeting
766 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
could be held only on 12th August 2020, when the Arbitral Tribunal
directed the first appellant to file a formal application for dismissal
of the claim of Sheil and permitted Sheil to file a reply. Accordingly,
on 27th August 2020, the first appellant filed an application invoking
the Arbitral Tribunal’s power under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of
Section 32 of the Arbitration Act. The contention raised by the first
appellant in the said application was that Sheil’s conduct of not taking
any steps for eight years shows that the said company abandoned
the arbitral proceedings. Sheil filed an affidavit and specifically
contended that no ground was made out to act under Section 32(2)
(c) of the Arbitration Act. Sheil also raised other factual contentions
and denied the allegation of abandonment.
5. The Arbitral Tribunal passed an order on 1st December 2020
terminating the arbitral proceedings in the exercise of power under
Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act. The Arbitral Tribunal relied
upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of NRP
Projects Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Hirak Mukhopadhyay & Anr1. Sheil
filed an application before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay to
challenge the legality and validity of the order of the Arbitral Tribunal
by taking recourse to Section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act. By the
impugned judgment and order, the learned Single Judge set aside
the order of termination of the proceedings passed by the Arbitral
Tribunal and directed the Arbitral Tribunal to continue the proceedings.
We may note here that I.A. no.180843 of 2023 reveals that on 26th
July, 2023, the learned sole Arbitrator informed the parties of his
unwillingness to continue as the sole Arbitrator.

Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
that Section 14 of the Arbitration Act does not empower the Court
to second-guess the Arbitral Tribunal, especially when the decision
of the Arbitral Tribunal is based on the appreciation of facts and a
plausible view has been taken. The learned senior counsel further
pointed out that the Arbitral Tribunal attempted to ensure Sheil’s
participation in Marico’s arbitration. After the award in the case of
Marico, Sheil declined to attend the meeting held on 11th March
2020 by the Arbitral Tribunal. It is submitted that there is nothing on
record to indicate that the arbitration based on Sheil’s claim was to
proceed after Marico’s arbitration, and there is no material placed
on record to that effect. He submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had
rendered a finding of fact on the stand taken by Sheil, which cannot
be disturbed by the Court. He submitted that Sheil’s plea that it was
awaiting the decision in the Marico arbitration could not be accepted
as the Arbitral Tribunal never indicated that the arbitration based on
Sheil’s claim would proceed only after the Marico arbitration was
over. He submitted that Sheil took no interest in moving the Arbitral
Tribunal for a long time since 2012. He submitted that the word
“unnecessary” used in Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act will
have to be widely or liberally interpreted.
7. Mr Shekhar Naphade, the learned senior counsel appearing for Sheil,
contended that without recording a positive finding that it is either
unnecessary or impossible to continue the proceedings, the power
under Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act cannot be exercised.
Relying upon the decision on this Court in the case of Lalitkumar V
Sanghavi & Anr. v. Dharamdas V Sanghavi & Ors.3, the learned
senior counsel submitted that the Court, while exercising the power
under Section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act, is required to go into the
issue of the legality of the termination of mandate by the Arbitral
Tribunal. He submitted that the abandonment cannot be inferred.
He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Godrej and
Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited v. Municipal Corporation
of Greater Mumbai & Ors4. He submitted that suits filed by Marico
and Sheil were separate suits, and, therefore, arbitral proceedings
were also separate. Marico and Sheil had not sought any relief

against each other. However, as there was an overlap between the
two references concerning the enforceability of the consent terms,
the parties agreed to proceed with Sheil’s reference after Marico’s
reference was decided. He further submitted that after preliminary
directions were issued on 8th November 2011 regarding the filing of
pleadings, no further directions were issued by the sole Arbitrator in
the reference of Sheil. He submitted that the decision of the Calcutta
High Court in the case of NRP Projects Pvt. Ltd.1 is confined to the
facts of the case before it. He submitted that Marico’s reference took
six years, and that is the reason for postponing Sheil’s reference. The
learned senior counsel would, therefore, submit that the interference
made by the High Court in the arbitral proceedings under Section
14 of the Arbitration Act was certainly justified.
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS
8. Chapter V of the Arbitration Act contains provisions regarding the
conduct of arbitral proceedings. If parties do not agree on the
timelines for filing statements of claim and defence, under sub-
section (1) of Section 23, the Arbitral Tribunal has the power to
determine the timelines for filing pleadings. Sub-section (4) of Section
23, incorporated with effect from 23rd October 2015, provides that
the filing of pleadings (statements of claim and defence) shall be
completed within six months from the date the learned Arbitrator or
all the learned Arbitrators, as the case may be, receive notice of
their appointment in writing.
9. After the pleadings are complete, the next stage is of hearing. Sub-
section (2) of Section 24 provides that parties shall be given sufficient
advance notice of any hearing or meeting of the Arbitral Tribunal for
inspections of documents, goods or other property.
10. The issue of the parties’ default is dealt with in Section 25 of the
Arbitration Act. Section 25 reads thus:
“25. Default of a party.—Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, where, without showing sufficient cause,—
(a) the claimant fails to communicate his statement
of claim in accordance with sub-section (1) of
section 23, the arbitral tribunal shall terminate
the proceedings;
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 769
Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
(b) the respondent fails to communicate his statement of
defence in accordance with sub-section (1) of section
23, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the proceedings
without treating that failure in itself as an admission
of the allegations by the claimant and shall have the
discretion to treat the right of the respondent to file
such statement of defence as having been forfeited.
(c) a party fails to appear at an oral hearing or to
produce documentary evidence, the arbitral
tribunal may continue the proceedings and make
the arbitral award on the evidence before it.”
(emphasis added)
Clause (a) of Section 25 of the Arbitration Act provides that on the
failure of the claimants to communicate the statement of claim in
accordance with sub-section (1) of Section 23, the Arbitral Tribunal
shall terminate the proceedings. Clause (b) of Section 25 provides
that if the respondent fails to communicate his statement of defence
in accordance with sub-section (1) of Section 23, the Arbitral Tribunal
shall continue the proceedings. Clause (c) of Section 25 provides that
if a party fails to appear at an oral hearing or to produce documents,
the Arbitral Tribunal may continue the proceedings and make the
arbitral award on the basis of whatever evidence is available with it.
The power to terminate arbitral proceedings on the claimant’s default
to file a statement of claim is the only provision under the Arbitration
Act to terminate the arbitral proceedings apart from Section 32.
11. The Arbitration Act has two provisions for terminating an Arbitrator’s
mandate. Sections 14 and 15 are the relevant sections. The
Arbitrator is empowered to withdraw from his office, which terminates
his mandate. However, the arbitral proceedings continue by the
arbitrator’s substitution.
12. The order of termination passed by the learned Arbitrator, in this
case, gives an impression that he was of the view that unless
parties move the Arbitral Tribunal with a request to fix a meeting
or a date for the hearing, the Tribunal was under no obligation to
fix a meeting or a date for hearing. The appointment of the Arbitral
Tribunal is made with the object of adjudicating upon the dispute
covered by the arbitration clause in the agreement between the
770 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
parties. By agreement, the parties can appoint an Arbitrator or
Arbitral Tribunal. Otherwise, the Court can do so under section 11
of the Arbitration Act. An Arbitrator does not do pro bono work. For
him, it is a professional assignment. A duty is vested in the learned
Arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate upon the dispute and
to make an award. The object of the Arbitration Act is to provide
for an efficient dispute resolution process. An Arbitrator who has
accepted his appointment cannot say that he will not fix a meeting
to conduct arbitral proceedings or a hearing date unless the parties
request him to do so. It is the duty of the Arbitral Tribunal to do
so. If the claimant fails to file his statement of claim in accordance
with Section 23, in view of clause (a) of Section 25, the learned
Arbitrator is bound to terminate the proceedings. If the respondent
to the proceedings fails to file a statement of defence in accordance
with Section 23, in the light of clause (b) of Section 25, the learned
Arbitrator is bound to proceed further with the arbitral proceedings.
Even if the claimant, after filing a statement of claim, fails to appear
at an oral hearing or fails to produce documentary evidence, the
learned Arbitrator is expected to continue the proceedings as
provided in clause (c) of Section 25. Thus, he can proceed to make
an award in such a case.
13. On a conjoint reading of Sections 14 and 15, it is apparent that an
Arbitrator always has the option to withdraw for any reason. Therefore,
he can withdraw because of the parties’ non-cooperation in the
proceedings. But in such a case, his mandate will be terminated,
not the arbitral proceedings.
14. Now, we come to Section 32 of the Arbitration Act, which reads thus:
“32. Termination of proceedings.— (1) The arbitral
proceedings shall be terminated by the final arbitral award
or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (2).
(2) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the
termination of the arbitral proceedings where—
(a) the claimant withdraws his claim, unless the
respondent objects to the order and the arbitral
tribunal recognises a legitimate interest on
his part in obtaining a final settlement of the
dispute,
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 771
Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
(b) the parties agree on the termination of the
proceedings, or
(c) the arbitral tribunal finds that the continuation
of the proceedings has for any other reason
become unnecessary or impossible.
(3) Subject to section 33 and sub-section (4) of section
34, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal shall terminate with
the termination of the arbitral proceedings.”
(emphasis added)
Section 32 provides for the termination of the arbitral proceedings
in the following contingencies:
a. On making final arbitral award;
b. On the Claimant withdrawing his claim as provided under clause
(a) of sub-section (2) of Section 32;
c. Parties agreeing on termination of arbitral proceedings as
provided under clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 32; or
d. When the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the continuation of
proceedings has become unnecessary or impossible for any
other reason, as provided under clause (c) of sub-section (2)
of Section 32.
15. Therefore, clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32 can be invoked
for reasons other than those mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 32
and clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 32. Under clause
(c), the mere existence of a reason for terminating the proceedings
is not sufficient. The reason must be such that the continuation
of the proceedings has become unnecessary or impossible. In a
given case, when a claimant files a claim and does not attend the
proceedings, clause (a) of Section 25 comes into operation, resulting
in the learned Arbitrator terminating the proceedings. If, after filing
a claim, the claimant fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to
produce documentary evidence, it cannot be said that the continuation
of proceedings has become unnecessary. If the claimant fails to
appear at an oral hearing after filing the claim, in view of clause (c)
of Section 25, the learned Arbitrator can proceed with the arbitral
proceedings. The fact that clause (c) of Section 25 enables the
772 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Arbitral Tribunal to proceed in the absence of the claimant shows
the legislature’s intention that the claimant’s failure to appear after
filing the claim cannot be a ground to say that the proceedings have
become unnecessary or impossible.
16. Therefore, if the party fails to appear for a hearing after filing a
claim, the learned Arbitrator cannot say that continuing the arbitral
proceedings has become unnecessary. Abandonment by the claimant
of his claim may be grounds for saying that the arbitral proceedings
have become unnecessary. However, the abandonment must
be established. Abandonment can be either express or implied.
Abandonment cannot be readily inferred. One can say that there is an
implied abandonment when admitted or proved facts are so clinching
and convincing that the only inference which can be drawn is of the
abandonment. Mere absence in proceedings or failure to participate
does not, per se, amount to abandonment. Only if the established
conduct of a claimant is such that it leads only to one conclusion
that the claimant has given up, his/her claim can an inference of
abandonment be drawn. Merely because a claimant, after filing his
statement of claim, does not move the Arbitral Tribunal to fix a date
for the hearing, it cannot be said that the claimant has abandoned
his claim. The reason is that the Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to fix a
date for a hearing. If the parties remain absent, the Arbitral Tribunal
can take recourse to Section 25.
17. Now, coming to the facts of the case, we must note here that Sheil and
Marico had filed separate suits. In the suit filed by Marico, an order was
passed on 13th October 2011, referring the dispute involved therein
to the sole Arbitrator. Similarly, in the suit filed by Sheil, the order of
reference to the learned Arbitrator was passed on 17th November
2011. Therefore, by two separate orders, two arbitral proceedings
were ordered to be initiated. In one proceeding, the claimant was
Marico. The first appellant and Sheil were the respondents. In the
other, Sheil was the claimant. The first appellant and Marico were
the respondents. In fact, in the minutes of the preliminary meeting
dated 8th November 2011, it is noted that the learned Arbitrator
issued directions to Marico and Sheil to file their statements of claim.
Therefore, even the learned Arbitrator proceeded on the footing that
there were two distinct claimants and claims. They were directed to
file their statements of claim in the respective arbitral proceedings.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 773
Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
After that, on 20th December 2011, the learned Arbitrator granted
an extension of time to complete the pleadings. Both the claimants
filed their respective statements of claim. The learned Arbitrator first
conducted arbitral proceedings in which the claimant was Marico.
Paragraph 10 of the award dated 6th May 2017 made on Marico’s
claim is very relevant, which reads thus:
“10. The 2nd Respondent has also filed a reply to the
Statement of Claim. However, no evidence was led by
the 2nd Respondent (either documentary or oral) nor
was any argument addressed by the 2nd Respondent to
me, although the 2nd Respondent was present at all
hearings of this arbitration.”
(emphasis added)
The respondent no.2 before the Arbitral Tribunal was Sheil, as can be
seen from the cause title of the award. Thus, Sheil was represented
throughout before the Arbitral Tribunal during the hearing of the
claim of Marico. Therefore, it cannot be said that the first respondent
herein (Sheil) remained absent. On the contrary, it was present at all
hearings. Nothing is placed on record to show that simultaneously
with the arbitral proceedings based on the claim of Marico, any
meeting or date was fixed by the learned Arbitrator for hearing the
claim of Sheil. The first meeting on Sheil’s claim was fixed on 11th
March 2020 when COVID-19 pandemic had already set in.
18. The application made by the first appellant under Section 32(2)(c)
of the Arbitration Act, in short, raised the following contentions:
a. Sheil did not bother to pursue its claim for eight years after
filing the statement of claim;
b. Sheil did not attend the meeting of 11th March 2020;
c. Sheil attended the next meeting held on 12th August 2020 and
informed the learned Arbitrator that it wished to press its claim
and
d. Sheil has abandoned its claim.
19. Sheil filed an affidavit in reply to the said application filed by the
first appellant. In the reply, a contention has been raised that the
reference filed by Marico was taken up first and therefore, till the
774 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
award was made on 6th May 2017, there was no requirement on
the part of Sheil to take any further steps. The affidavit of evidence
of Mr. Sanjay Patel was affirmed on 16th April 2017 and was kept
ready. Sheil has pleaded that there was a requirement to change its
advocate. After Sheil engaged the services of M/s. Markand Gandhi &
Co., its senior partner fell ill and died on 1st May 2018. As regards the
meeting held on 11th March 2020, Sheil claimed that it had deputed
one Mr Utsav Ghosh to attend the meeting. He reached late after
the meeting dispersed.
20. The question is whether Sheil abandoned its claim filed before the
learned Arbitrator. As stated earlier, Sheil regularly attended meetings
held to hear Marico’s claim. During the period during which the claim
of Marico was heard, at no stage, the learned Arbitrator suggested
that the claim of Sheil could be heard simultaneously. On the contrary,
from the conduct of the parties and the learned Arbitrator, an inference
can be drawn that Marico’s claim was given priority. Two meetings
were convened in March 2020 in connection with Sheil’s claim. In
March 2020, the COVID-19 was spreading its wings in our country.
The second meeting in March 2020 was admittedly not held. In any
case, there is no express abandonment. Even if it is to be implied,
there must be convincing circumstances on record which lead to
an inevitable inference about the abandonment. In the facts of the
case, there was no abandonment either express or implied. In a
case where the claim is abandoned, the learned Arbitrator can take
the view that it would be unnecessary to continue the proceedings
based on the already abandoned claim. In this case, the inference
of the abandonment has been drawn by the learned Arbitrator only
on the grounds that Sheil did not challenge the Marico award and
took no steps to convene the meeting of the Arbitral Tribunal. The
failure to challenge the award on Marico’s claim will not amount to
abandonment of the claim filed by Sheil in January 2012. In the claim
submitted by Sheil, a prayer was made in the alternative for passing
an award in terms of money against the first appellant. Therefore,
we hold that there was absolutely no material on record to conclude
that Sheil had abandoned its claim or, at least, the claim against
the first appellant. Till the award dated 6th May 2017 was passed
in Marico’s claim, Sheil’s representative was always present at all
hearings till the passing of the award. After the award, the learned
Arbitrator never convened a meeting to deal with Sheil’s claim until
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 775
Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
11th March 2020. Hence, the finding of the learned Arbitrator that
there was abandonment of the claim by the first appellant is not
based on any documentary or oral evidence on record. The finding
is entirely illegal. Such a finding could never have been rendered on
the material before the Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, the learned Arbitrator
committed illegality.
21. To conclude,
a. The power under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32 of
the Arbitration Act can be exercised only if, for some reason,
the continuation of proceedings has become unnecessary or
impossible. Unless the Arbitral Tribunal records its satisfaction
based on the material on record that proceedings have become
unnecessary or impossible, the power under clause (c) of sub-
section (2) of Section 32 cannot be exercised. If the said power
is exercised casually, it will defeat the very object of enacting
the Arbitration Act;
b. It is the Arbitral Tribunal’s duty to fix a meeting for hearing even
if parties to the proceedings do not make such a request. It is
the duty of the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate upon the dispute
referred to it. If, on a date fixed for a meeting/hearing, the
parties remain absent without any reasonable cause, the Arbitral
Tribunal can always take recourse to the relevant provisions of
the Arbitration Act, such as Section 25;
c. The failure of the claimant to request the Arbitral Tribunal to fix
a date for hearing, per se, is no ground to conclude that the
proceedings have become unnecessary; and
d. The abandonment of the claim by a claimant can be a ground
to invoke clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32. The
abandonment of the claim can be either express or implied.
The abandonment cannot be readily inferred. There is an
implied abandonment when admitted or proved facts are so
clinching that the only inference which can be drawn is of the
abandonment. Only if the established conduct of a claimant
is such that it leads only to one conclusion that the claimant
has given up his/her claim can an inference of abandonment
be drawn. Even if it is to be implied, there must be convincing
circumstances on record which lead to an inevitable inference
776 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
about the abandonment. Only because a claimant, after filing
his statement of claim, does not move the Arbitral Tribunal to
fix a date for the hearing, the failure of the claimant, per se,
will not amount to the abandonment of the claim.
22. Therefore, for the reasons recorded above, we concur with the
view taken by the learned Single Judge. The appeal is, accordingly,
dismissed with no order as to costs. As the learned sole Arbitrator
has withdrawn from the proceedings, the parties shall take necessary
steps to get the substituted Arbitrator appointed in accordance with
law.

The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
(Civil Appeal No. 3391 of 2011)

[Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and Aravind Kumar, JJ.]","Whether the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 or the
Rajasthan Stamp Act, 1998 applies to the facts of the present case;
whether the state government has the legislative competence to
impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance as per
Entry 91 of List I r/w Entry 44 of List III; whether the 1952 Act
requires the purchase of insurance stamps from and payment of
stamp duty to the Rajasthan government for insurance policies
issued within the state; whether, in the facts of the present case,
the appellant is liable to pay stamp duty.

Stamp Rules, 1955 – Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – s.3; Schedule
I – Rajasthan Stamp Act, 1998 – Constitution of India – Entry
44 of List III, Entry 91 of List I – Power of the State to levy
and collect stamp duty on insurance policies executed within
the State – Appellant issued various insurance policies within
the State of Rajasthan however, purchased insurance stamps
from the State of Maharashtra – Demand for payment of stamp

must be imposed as per the rate prescribed by a Parliamentary
legislation under Entry 91 of List I – For the execution of insurance
policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to

adopted from Schedule I of the central Act, in accordance with Entry
91 of List I – The charging provision has thus been validly enacted
by the state government under Entry 44 of List III – Therefore, the
state government in the present case can impose stamp duty on
the issuance of insurance policies within its territory and require
the payment of such stamp duty by the appellant – Hence, the
commencement of proceedings for recovery of stamp duty under
the state law and the rules made thereunder was legal, valid, and
justified – However, in the facts and circumstances of the present
case, the state government shall not demand and collect the stamp
duty as per the orders dtd.16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004,
01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004 – Impugned judgment of the High
Court affirmed. [Paras 16, 37, 31, 38]
Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – Rajasthan
Stamp Act, 1998 – s.3 – Insurance policies issued between
1993-94 to 2001-02 – Stamp duty leviable under the 1952 Act
or the 1998 Act:
Held: Stamp duty must be levied as per the law in force as on
the date of execution of the instrument – The charging provision
i.e. s.3 of the 1998 Act, imposed stamp duty on every instrument
mentioned in the Schedule that is executed in the state on or
after the date of commencement of the Act – 1998 Act came into
force only on 27.05.2004 – Hence, at the time that the relevant
instruments were executed, the 1952 Act was still in force and the
stamp duty was leviable under the same. [Para 8]
Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – ss.2, 3(v),
(vi) – Application of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 – Adaptations
– Schedule I of the 1899 Act – Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955
– rr.2 (d), 3 – Liability to pay stamp duty under the 1952 Act:
Held: r.3, r/w r.2(d), provides that the stamps issued by the State
government will indicate the payment of stamp duty chargeable on an
instrument – Therefore, the stamp must be issued by and the stamp
duty must be paid to the State government for an instrument to be
‘duly stamped’ under the 1952 Act – State has the power to collect
stamp duty under s.3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted
to the state of Rajasthan that provides that an instrument shall be
chargeable with the duty of the amount indicated in the Schedule if
it is executed within the state of Rajasthan – The mandate of s.3 is
also found in r.3 that provides for “mode of payment” – r.3, read with
r.2(d), provides that the duty with which any instrument is chargeable
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 243
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
shall be paid by means of a stamp issued by the state government –
The relevant event flowing from s.3 and r.3 authorising the levy and
imposition of stamp duty is the execution of the policy of insurance
within the state – The liability to purchase the stamps from the state
of Rajasthan is therefore clear and unambiguous – Consequently,
for instruments executed within the state, the purchase of stamps
from outside the state will equate to evasion of stamp duty and the
instrument will not be ‘duly stamped’. [Paras 22, 26]
Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – s.3A(1) –
Appellant issued various insurance policies within the state
of Rajasthan and was required to affix stamps by paying
stamp duty on such policies – It wrote to the Collector, Jaipur
regarding the non-availability of ‘Agents License Fee stamps’
– Plea of the appellant that in view of the letter of the Treasury
Officer, Jaipur dated 07.10.1991 stating that ‘India Insurance
Stamps’ are the property of the central government and their
supply and distribution is not related to their department, they
were compelled to purchase the stamps from Maharashtra,
without which they could not have issued the insurance
policies in the state of Rajasthan – High Court without taking
note of the aforesaid letter held that the correspondence of
the appellant with the department pertained to Agents License
Fee stamps and even if the stamps were unavailable, the
appellant was duty-bound to pay the stamp duty to the state
government in cash as provided under s.3A(1) – Propriety:
Held: High Court evidently did not take note of the letter dated
07.10.1991 – Further, it entirely failed to consider sub-section
(4) which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the
application of s.3A – Therefore, the High Court also erred in holding
that the appellant could have paid the stamp duty in cash – In view
of the above circumstances, the appellant had no choice but to
purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state – While it
made every endeavour to purchase the stamp from within the state,
due to the letter by the department and the lack of mechanism for
payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability
of insurance stamps, it was unable to purchase the stamps and
pay the stamp duty to the Rajasthan government. [Para 36]
Constitution of India – Seventh Schedule – Stamp duty –
Entry 91 of List I, Entry 63 of List II, and Entry 44 of List III
– Distribution of legislative competence:
244 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Held: A combined reading of the constitutional scheme shows
that the power to prescribe the rate of duty is mutually exclusive
and has been clearly demarcated between the Parliament and the
legislatures of the state – Insurance policies, which are the relevant
instrument for the purpose of the present case, fall under Entry
91 of List I for the purpose of prescription of rate of duty – This
means that only the Parliament holds the exclusive power and the
legislative competence under the Constitution to prescribe the rate
of stamp duty on insurance policies. [Para 12]
Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 – Indian Stamp
Act, 1899 – Constitution of India – Article 254; Entry 44, List III:
Held: In the present case, the imposition of stamp duty by the
state government was under the 1952 Act, which is a state law
that has been enacted under Entry 44 of List III, and has received
Presidential assent as contemplated under Article 254 – Article
254(2) clearly stipulates that when a state law with respect to a
matter in the Concurrent List is repugnant to the provisions of an
earlier law made by the Parliament or an existing law with respect
to that matter, then the law passed by the state shall prevail in that
state “if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President
and has received his assent” – The 1952 Act that occupies the
field in the present case has undisputedly received Presidential
assent and hence it prevails over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 so
far as the state of Rajasthan is concerned. [Para 29]
Tax/Taxation – Tax law – Plea that the rate of taxation is an
essential component for a valid imposition of tax and since
the State legislature cannot prescribe the rate of stamp duty
on insurance policies, there can be no valid imposition of
stamp duty on these instruments by way of a state enactment:
Held: Rejected – Even if the State legislature cannot prescribe the
rate of stamp duty, it can levy such duty at the rate as provided by
the Parliament – In the present case, while it is true that the State
cannot prescribe the rate of duty on insurance policies, that by itself
does not mean that there is ambiguity or lack of clarity regarding
the rate of such duty – Rather, the rate of duty is unambiguous,
clear, and defined by the Parliament and is adopted by the state
to levy and collect stamp duty. [Para 18]

Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J.
1. The issue for consideration is whether the state of Rajasthan has
the power and jurisdiction to levy and collect stamp duty on policies
of insurance issued within the state. For the reasons to follow, we
have rejected the contention of the Life Insurance Corporation, the
appellant herein, regarding the lack of legislative competence of the
state and have also affirmed the power to levy and collect stamp
duty under the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 19521 and
the rules made thereunder. While dismissing the appeal, we have
however set aside certain findings of the High Court and granted
relief to the appellant in the facts and circumstances of the case. We
will first refer to the necessary facts before analysing the provisions
and drawing our conclusions.
2. Facts: The appellant issued various insurance policies within the state
of Rajasthan between 1993-94 and 2001-02. As per the prevailing
law relating to stamp duty, the appellant was required to affix stamps
1 Hereinafter ‘1952 Act’.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 247
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
by paying stamp duty on the policies of insurance issued by it in
accordance with the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, as adapted to the state
of Rajasthan by the 1952 Act.
2.1 On 19.08.1991, the appellant wrote to the Collector, Jaipur
regarding the non-availability of ‘Agents License Fee stamps’. On
07.10.1991, the Treasury Officer, Jaipur replied to the appellant
that ‘India Insurance Stamps’ are the property of the central
government and their supply and distribution is not related to
their department.
2.2 On 15.04.2004 and 06.05.2004, the Inspector General
(Registration and Stamps) Rajasthan, Ajmer issued a letter to
the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 1.19 crores for causing
loss of revenue to the state of Rajasthan as it had purchased
insurance stamps between 1993-94 and 2001-02 from the state
of Maharashtra for insurance policies that were issued within the
state of Rajasthan. Pursuantly, the Additional Collector (Stamps),
Jaipur issued a show-cause notice under Section 37(5) of the
Rajasthan Stamp Act, 19982 for payment of the amount.
2.3 By order dated 16.09.2004, the Additional Collector (Stamps),
Jaipur confirmed the show-cause notice and directed
the appellant to deposit the amount. It was held that the
correspondence between the appellant and the department
pertained to Agents Fee Stamps and not India Insurance stamps
that are affixed on insurance policies and were available at the
relevant time. Similar orders were passed on 16.10.2004 for
Rs. 1.07 crores, 11.10.2004 for Rs. 1.18 crores, 01.11.2004
for Rs. 1.87 crores, and 28.10.2004 for Rs. 43.68 lakhs. The
appellant also challenged these orders by way of separate
writ petitions, which have been disposed of in the judgment
impugned before us.3
2.4 The appellant filed a writ petition challenging the order of
the Additional Collector dated 16.09.2004, which came to be

(‘impugned judgment’).
248 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
dismissed by the High Court single judge4 on the ground that
the appellant has an alternative efficacious remedy of filing a
revision under Section 65 of the Rajasthan Stamp Act.
2.5 The appellant preferred a writ appeal before the division bench,
which was initially disposed of by an order dated 11.12.2004
wherein the High Court directed the Chief Secretary of the
Rajasthan government to constitute a High Powered Committee
under his chairmanship to decide the matter by a reasoned
order. It was also held that if either party is dissatisfied with
the decision of the committee, they could file for revival of the
writ appeal. The Committee constituted pursuant to this order
rejected the appellant’s representation, due to which the writ
appeal was restored and decided in the impugned judgment5.
3. Reasoning of the High Court: It is necessary to briefly discuss
the reasoning of the High Court in dismissing the writ appeal and
confirming the imposition of stamp duty. The High Court relied
on Sections 2, 3(v), and 3A of the 1952 Act read with Rules 2(d)
and 3 of the Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955. Section 2 provides that
subject to the other provisions of this Act, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899
shall apply to the whole state of Rajasthan on and from 01.04.1958.
Section 3(v) provides that reference in the Indian Act to ‘government’
shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as reference
to the state government. Section 3A(1) provides for payment of stamp
duty in cash when stamps are not available for sale.
3.1 Rule 2(d) of the Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955 defines
government as state government and Rule 3 provides for the
mode of payment of stamp duty to the state government.
3.2 Relying on these provisions, specifically Section 3A(1), the High
Court held that the appellant should have paid the stamp duty
in cash and the receipt would be affixed on the instrument as
envisaged under this provision. It was also held that there was
no legal sanction under the scheme of the Act that permits the
appellant to purchase such stamps from outside the state in case

The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
of non-availability.6 It further held that in any case, only Agents
License Fee stamps were unavailable while the imposition of
stamp duty was on India Insurance Stamps.7
3.3 Relying on Rule 2(d) that defines ‘government’ as meaning
government of Rajasthan and Rule 3 that mandates payment
of stamp duty to the state government, the High Court held
that the stamps must only be purchased from the Rajasthan
government.8 The only exception provided is under Section 3A
when the person can deposit cash with the government treasury
in case of non-availability of stamps and affix the receipt of
challan with the instrument.9 The 1952 Act and the 1955 Rules
do not permit the appellant to purchase stamps from outside
the state that do not bear the superimposition of the words
‘Rajasthan’ or letters ‘RAJ’ as provided in the Explanation to
Rule 3.10 On such reading of the law and facts, the High Court
upheld the order of the Collector dated 16.09.2004.
4. The High Court also dealt with the arguments by the parties on
the competence of the state government to impose stamp duty
on insurance policies based on the distribution of legislative fields
in the Seventh Schedule on stamp duty. The High Court held that
Entry 91 of List I (Union List) empowers the Parliament to enact a
law relating to rate of stamp duty in respect of various instruments,
including policies of insurance. Entry 44 of List III (Concurrent List)
empowers both the Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws
with respect to “stamp duties other than duties or fees collected by
means of judicial stamps, but not including rates of stamp duty”.
4.1 The High Court held that the 1952 Act has been enacted under
Entry 44, List III and has received Presidential assent. It does
not occupy the field covered by Entry 91 of List I as it does
not fix or prescribe the rate of duty for insurance stamps but
only provides for the collection of stamp duty. The High Court

Digital Supreme Court Reports
hence rejected the submission by the appellant that the state
government does not have the power to demand payment for
insurance stamps as they fall under the Union List.
4.2 It also rejected the appellant’s reliance on this Court’s judgment in
VVS Rama Sharma v. State of Uttar Pradesh11 by differentiating
it as in that case, there was no state law that had received
Presidential assent and instead the consideration was under
Rule 115A of the UP Stamp Rules, 1942.12 Since the 1952 Act
had received Presidential assent, it was held to be a special law
that has overriding effect, which was not the case in VVS Rama
Sharma (supra) where the Indian Stamp Act read with rules
framed by the state of UP was applicable.13 It also differentiated
the case on facts as VVS Rama Sharma (supra) pertained to
the commission of criminal offences under the Indian Penal
Code and the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.14
5. Submissions by the appellant: The learned ASG, Mr. N. Venkataraman,
appeared on behalf of the appellant and has made two primary
arguments. The gist of his submission is: First, that on the basis
of Entry 91 of List I, Entry 63 of List II, and Entry 44 of List III, the
state of Rajasthan does not have the legislative competence to
impose and collect stamp duty on insurance policies as the same
falls under the Union List. Second, that the show-cause notice and
the proceedings are under the 1998 Act, which does not provide
for imposition of stamp duty by the state on policies of insurance.
Alternatively, even if the 1952 Act applies, the appellant had no
option but to purchase the stamps from Maharashtra due to their
admitted unavailability and in view of Section 3A(4) of the 1952 Act.
The detailed arguments are as follows:
5.1 Learned ASG has relied on Entry 47 of List I on insurance and
Entry 91 of List I that empowers the Parliament to prescribe
the rate of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange, cheques,
promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of
insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts.

13 ibid, p. 20
14 ibid.
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 251
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
He has argued that since insurance falls under the Union list
and more specifically, since only the Union can prescribe the
rate of stamp duty on insurance policies, the state government
cannot demand that the stamp duty on insurance policies
must necessarily be paid to it and that the stamps cannot be
purchased from other states. He relied on VVS Rama Sharma
(supra) on the point that a state cannot require that insurance
stamps, which are property of the central government, must be
purchased only from that particular state when the insurance
policy is issued within its territory. Challenging the imposition
of stamp duty by the state government, the learned ASG has
further submitted that a levy of stamp duty is in the nature of
tax and that there is no valid imposition of tax unless there is
a rate of taxation. Relying on Govind Saran Ganga Saran v.
Commissioner of Sales Tax15 and Mathuram Agrawal v. State
of Madhya Pradesh16, he has submitted that the rate of stamp
duty must be clearly and unambiguously ascertainable, without
which there is no valid tax law. Since the state does not have
the domain competence to prescribe the rate of stamp duty
in the present case, it cannot validly impose and demand the
payment of such duty. Lastly, the learned ASG has argued that
Entry 44 of List III is not in the nature of a taxation entry by
relying on State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries17 and
State of Karnataka v. State of Meghalaya18. He submits that it is
well-settled in taxation law that entries pertaining to taxation are
clearly demarcated between the Union List and the State List.
There is no head of taxation in the Concurrent List. Hence, the
state government cannot impose stamp duty on the appellant
by claiming legislative competence under Entry 44 of List III.
5.2 Apart from arguing that levy of stamp duty by the state is
contrary to the constitutional scheme, the learned ASG has
also argued that stamp duty cannot be imposed in the present
case under the specific state enactments. He has argued that
the 1998 Act applies in the present case as the notice for
15 [1985] 3 SCR 985 : 1985 Supp SCC 205, para 6
16 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR.195 : (1999) 8 SCC 667, para 12

252 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
recovery has been issued under Section 37(5) of the 1998 Act.
Section 3 of the 1998 Act is the charging provision that provides
that instruments shall be chargeable with duty of the amount
indicated in the Schedule. By comparing entry 47 of Schedule
I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (which provides the rates of
stamp duty for various kinds of policies of insurance) and the
Schedule under the 1998 Act, he has argued that there is no
parallel entry in the Schedule of the 1998 Act that provides the
rate of stamp duty on insurance policies. Since Section 3 only
provides for imposition of stamp duty as per rates prescribed
in the Schedule and there is no such rate of duty indicated,
the state government cannot demand stamp duty from the
appellant on insurance policies. Alternatively, the learned ASG
has argued that even if the 1952 Act applies, as considered
by the High Court in the impugned judgment, the stamp duty
could not have been paid to the Rajasthan government in
the present case due to the admitted unavailability of India
Insurance stamps with the treasury. Relying on the letter from
the department dated 07.10.1991, he argued that the High Court
erred in holding that only Agents License Fee stamps were
unavailable when the letter clearly mentioned India Insurance
stamps. Further, the letter also stated that these stamps are
central government property and their supply and sale is not
related to the state government. Relying on this letter by the
department, the learned ASG has submitted that the government
could not have then demanded payment of stamp duty in 2004.
Lastly, he has argued that the High Court’s reliance on Section
3A to hold that the duty could have been paid in cash in case
of unavailability of stamps is misplaced as sub-clause (4) of
Section 3A clearly stipulates that the provision does not apply
to payment of stamp duty chargeable on instruments specified
in Entry 91 of List I. Since insurance policies are an instrument
that fall under this entry, Section 3A does not apply to it and
the appellant could not have paid the stamp duty in cash. The
High Court erred in its conclusion as it had entirely failed to
consider this sub-clause. A similar provision is also contained
in Section 4(4) of the 1998 Act. Hence, he concluded that there
was no way for the appellant to have paid stamp duty to the
Rajasthan government and they had to purchase the stamps
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 253
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
from outside the state as non-payment of duty would lead to
evasion and an unstamped insurance policy would not be
admissible in evidence.
6. Submissions by the respondent: Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned senior
counsel for the state, has argued that the state has the power to
impose and collect stamp duty on insurance policies under Entry
44 of List III. He has argued that while the power to prescribe the
rate of such duty falls within the exclusive domain of the Parliament,
the power to collect and impose the duty and to frame a charging
provision lies with the Parliament and the state legislatures under
Entry 44 of the Concurrent List, which is a sui generis provision. The
legislative competence of the states extends to collecting stamp duty
on instruments specified in Entry 91 of List I but does not extend
to prescribing the rate of duty for such instruments. The power to
prescribe the rate of stamp duty is clearly demarcated between the
Union and the states through Entry 91 of List I and Entry 63 of List
II. The state government can impose the duty at such rate that is
prescribed by the Parliament. He has also argued that Entry 44 of
List III is a taxation provision, as has been clearly held in Bar Council
of Uttar Pradesh v. State of Uttar Pradesh19.
6.1 Dr. Manish Singhvi further submits that the 1952 Act applies
since the period of levy is for policies issued between 1993-94
to 2001-02, which is prior to the 1998 Act coming into force
(on 27.05.2004). The 1952 Act received Presidential assent
and hence prevailed over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 in the
state as per Article 254(2). Section 3(vi) of this Act adopts
the Schedule from the central Act for the purpose of rate of
stamp duty. Hence, the stamp duty must be paid to the state
government for insurance transactions occurring within the
territory of the state after the 1952 Act came into force as
per the rate prescribed in entry 47 of Schedule I of the Indian
Stamp Act. Alternatively, he has argued that even if the 1998
Act applies, Sections 90 and 91 of that Act have the effect
of adopting the Indian Stamp Act with respect to instruments
contained in Entry 91 of List I. Lastly, he has differentiated the
present case from VVS Rama Sharma (supra) as that case
19 [1973] 2 SCR 1073 : (1973) 1 SCC 261
254 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
pertained to the registration of a criminal case against the
officers of LIC for non-payment of stamp duty and the lack of
criminal intent, leading to the quashing of FIR.
7. Issues: Having heard the learned ASG for the appellant and Dr.
Manish Singhvi for the respondent, the following issues arise for
our consideration:
I. Whether the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act applies to the facts of
the present case?
II. Whether the state government has the legislative competence
to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance as
per Entry 91 of List I read with Entry 44 of List III?
III. Whether the 1952 Act requires the purchase of insurance stamps
from and payment of stamp duty to the Rajasthan government
for insurance policies issued within the state?
IV. Whether, in the facts of the present case, the appellant is liable
to pay stamp duty?
I. Applicable Law
8. It is first important to determine whether stamp duty in the present
case can be imposed under the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act. The High
Court has relied on the provisions of the 1952 Act while arriving at
its conclusion. We agree with the High Court on this aspect as the
stamp duty must be levied as per the law in force as on the date
of execution of the instrument.20 In the present case, the insurance
policies were issued between 1993-94 to 2001-02. Section 3 of the
1998 Act21, which is the charging provision, imposes stamp duty on
every instrument mentioned in the Schedule that is executed in the
state on or after the date of commencement of the Act. The 1998 Act
came into force only on 27.05.2004 by way of a notification. Hence,
20 Vijay v. Union of India [2023] 15 SCR 293 2023 : SCC OnLine SC 1585, 2023 INSC 1030, para 11
21 The relevant portion of Section 3 of the 1998 Act reads:
“3. Instrument chargeable with duty.— Subject to the provisions of this Act and the exemptions
contained in the Schedule, the following instruments shall be chargeable with duty of the amount
indicated in the Schedule as the proper duty therefor respectively, that is to say,—
(a) every instrument mentioned in that Schedule, which, not having been previously executed by any
person, is executed in the State on or after the date of commencement of this Act;
(b) every instrument mentioned in that Schedule, which, not having been previously executed by any
person, is executed out of the State on or after the said date, relates to any matter or thing done or to be
done in the State and is received in the State, or relates to any property situate in the State.”
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 255
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
at the time that the relevant instruments were executed, the 1952
Act was still in force and the stamp duty is leviable under the same.
II. Legislative Competence
9. The learned ASG has forcefully contended that the state does not
have the power to collect and levy stamp duty on insurance policies
under the state enactment as only the Union can prescribe the rate
of stamp duty for such instruments. He has taken us through the
constitutional scheme on the fields of legislation under the Seventh
Schedule on matters of stamp duty. The relevant entries are Entry
91 of List I, Entry 63 of List II, and Entry 44 of List III, which have
been extracted here for reference:
Entry 91 of List I:
“91. Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange,
cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit,
policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures,
proxies and receipts.”
Entry 63 of List II:
“63. Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other
than those specified in the provisions of List I with regard
to rates of stamp duty.”
Entry 44 of List III:
“44. Stamp duties other than duties or fees collected by
means of judicial stamps, but not including rates of stamp
duty.”
10. Article 246 of the Constitution states that the Parliament has the
exclusive power to make laws with respect to any matter in List I,
the Parliament and the legislatures of any state have the power to
make laws with respect to any matter in List III, and the legislature
of any state has the exclusive power to make laws for such state or
any part thereof with respect to any matter in List II.22
22 Article 246 reads:
“246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.—(1)
Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred
to as the “Union List”).
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of
256 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
11. Reading the relevant entries of the Seventh Schedule in the context
of Article 246, the distribution of legislative competence with respect
to legislation on stamp duty is as follows. The Parliament has the
exclusive power to legislate on the rate of stamp duty with respect to
certain instruments, namely: bills of exchange, cheques, promissory
notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer
of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts, under Entry 91 of List
I. As per Entry 63 of List II, the legislatures of the states have the
exclusive power to legislate on the rate of stamp duty with respect
to documents other than those specified in Entry 91 of List I for their
state or any part of their state. In other words, there is a distribution
of instruments between the Parliament and the state legislatures as
regards the legislative competence to fix rates of stamp duty. However,
as per Entry 44 of List III, the Parliament and the legislatures of the
states have concurrent powers to legislate on stamp duties (other
than duties or fees collected by means of judicial stamps), but not
including rates of stamp duty.
12. A combined reading of the constitutional scheme shows that the
power to prescribe the rate of duty is mutually exclusive and has
been clearly demarcated between the Parliament and the legislatures
of the state.23 Insurance policies, which are the relevant instrument
for the purpose of the present case, fall under Entry 91 of List I
for the purpose of prescription of rate of duty. This means that
only the Parliament holds the exclusive power and the legislative
competence under the Constitution to prescribe the rate of stamp
duty on insurance policies. There is no dispute regarding this point.
13. The issue however that falls for our consideration is whether the state
government can enact a law that imposes stamp duty on insurance
policies by using the rate prescribed by the Parliament by sourcing
legislative competence through Entry 44 of List III.
any State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the “Concurrent List”).
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such
State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule
(in this Constitution referred to as the “State List”).
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not
included 2 [in a State] notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.”
23 VVS Rama Sharma (supra), paras 14-15
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 257
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
14. This Court in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) has answered this question
in the affirmative and has held that under Entry 44 of List III, “the power
to levy stamp duty on all documents, is concurrent. But the power
to prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded from Entry 44 of List
III and is divided between Parliament and the State Legislatures.”24
Therefore, the charging provision for imposition of stamp duty, even
on documents contained in Entry 91 of List I, can be enacted by both
the Parliament and the state legislatures, subject to the provisions
of Article 254.25 These principles have been summarised in VVS
Rama Sharma (supra) as follows:
“23. As mentioned earlier, under Entry 44 of List III, the
power to levy stamp duty on all documents is concurrent.
But the power to prescribe the rate of such levy is excluded
from Entry 44 of List III and is divided between Parliament
and the State Legislatures. If the instrument falls under
the categories mentioned in Entry 91 of List I, the power
to prescribe the rate will belong to Parliament, and for all
other instruments or documents, the power to prescribe
the rate belongs to the State Legislature under Entry 63
of List II. Therefore, the meaning of Entry 44 of List III is
that excluding the power to prescribe the rate, the charging
provisions of a law relating to stamp duty can be made both
by the Union and the State Legislature, in the concurrent
sphere, subject to Article 254 in case of repugnancy. So,
in the case at hand, it is Entry 91 of List I of the Seventh
Schedule which would be applicable and the States do
not have the power to circumvent a Central law.”
15. In a recent judgment in Vijay v. Union of India,26 this Court has again
held that the power to levy stamp duty on all documents is concurrent
under Entry 44 of List III. Only the power to prescribe the rate of
such duty is with the Parliament, and subject to Entry 91 of List I,
with the state legislatures.27

16. From the above precedents, it is clear that the state of Rajasthan has
the power to impose and collect stamp duty on insurance policies
under Entry 44 of List III, albeit such duty must be imposed as per the
rate prescribed by a Parliamentary legislation under Entry 91 of List I.
17. In view of the above explanation, the issue relating to legislative
competence raised by the learned ASG conclusively ends. However,
the learned ASG has raised additional arguments regarding the
requirements of a valid tax law and on whether Entry 44 of List III is a
taxation entry. Although we find these submissions to be unnecessary,
we will deal with them as they have been raised.
18. Relying on this Court’s decisions in Govind Saran Ganga Saran (supra)
and Mathuram Agarwal (supra), the learned ASG has argued that
the rate of taxation is an essential component for a valid imposition
of tax. Since the state legislature cannot prescribe the rate of stamp
duty on insurance policies, he has argued that there can be no valid
imposition of stamp duty on these instruments by way of a state
enactment. This argument must be rejected in view of the above
conclusion that even if the state legislature cannot prescribe the rate
of stamp duty, it can levy such duty at the rate as provided by the
Parliament. Both the decisions relied on by the learned ASG pertain
to cases where the charging provision was ambiguous in defining
an essential component of a valid tax law, i.e., the subject of the tax,
the person who is liable to pay the tax, and the rate at which the tax
is to be paid28. In the present case, while it is certainly true that the
state cannot prescribe the rate of duty on insurance policies, that by
itself does not mean that there is ambiguity or lack of clarity regarding
the rate of such duty. Rather, the rate of duty is unambiguous, clear,
and defined by the Parliament and is adopted by the state to levy
and collect stamp duty. Hence, this submission must be rejected.
19. The other submission by the learned ASG that there is no taxation entry
in the Concurrent List is based on this Court’s decisions in Kesoram
Industries (supra) and State of Karnataka v. State of Meghalaya
(supra). The learned ASG has pointed us to relevant portions of these
judgments. However, it must be noted that these judgments pertain
to taxation entries, rather than to entries on stamp duty. While stamp
28 Mathuram Agarwal (supra), para 6
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 259
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
duty is certainly in the nature of a tax,29 it has not been specifically
considered by this Court in these judgments. A three-judge bench of
this Court in Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh v. State of UP (supra) held
that payment of stamp duty pertains to the domain of taxation and
the imposition of such duty falls in pith and substance under Entry
44 of List III.30 This judgment came prior to the decisions relied on by
the learned ASG but has not been considered by the Court in those
cases as they did not pertain to stamp duty. Hence, it is clear that
Entry 44 of List III is a taxation entry that falls under the Concurrent
List and this submission must also be rejected. We hold that the
state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect
stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III, as per
the rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I.
III. Liability to Pay Stamp Duty Under the 1952 Act:
20. Provisions and Imposition of Stamp Duty Under the 1952 Act: Section
2 of the 1952 Act reads as follows:
“2. Application of Indian Act.–Subject to the other
provisions of this Act, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (II of
1899) of the Central Legislature as amended from time to
time, hereinafter referred to as the Indian Act shall apply
to the whole of the State of Rajasthan on and from the
1st day of April, 1958.”
(emphasis supplied)
21. Section 2 of the 1952 Act adopts the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and
makes it applicable to the state of Rajasthan subject to certain
adaptations that are contained in Section 3. Sections 3(v) and 3(vi)
are relevant for our purpose, and are as follows:
“3. Adaptations.–For the purposes of section 2,–
(v) references in the Indian Act to any Government shall,
unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as
references to the State Government, that is to say, to
the Government of the State of Rajasthan as formed by

section 10 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956 (Central
Act 37 of 1956):
Provided that in clause (i) of section 3 of the Indian Act,
the word “Government” wherever occurring shall mean
the State Government as well as the Central Government.
(vi) references in the Indian Act to Schedule I shall be
construed as references to the Second Schedule of the
Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 (Rajasthan
Act VII of 1952)”
22. Further, Rules 2(d) and 3 of the Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955 read
as follows:
“2(d) “Government” means the Government of the State
of Rajasthan”
“3. Mode of payment of duty-Except as otherwise provided
by the Act, or by these rules, -
(1) all duties with which any instrument is chargeable
shall be paid, and such payment shall be indicated on
such instruments, by means of stamps issued by the
Government for the purpose of the Act and these Rules; and
(2) a stamp which by any word or words on the face of it
is appropriated to any particular kind of instrument shall
not be used for any instrument of any other kind.
Explanation: - For the purpose of clause (1), a stamp
of the central Government or of the Government of
any covenanting State shall be deemed to have been
superimposed with word “Rajasthan” or with the letters
“RAJ”.”
Rule 3, read with Rule 2(d), provides that the stamps issued by the
state government will indicate the payment of stamp duty that is
chargeable on an instrument. Therefore, the stamp must be issued
by and the stamp duty must be paid to the state government for an
instrument to be ‘duly stamped’31 under the 1952 Act.
31 Section 2(11) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted to the state of Rajasthan reads:
“2. Definitions. — In this Act, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context, —
(11) “Duly stamped”. — “duly stamped”, as applied to an instrument, means that the instrument bears an

23. Pursuant to the adaptations by the 1952 Act, the relevant portion of
Section 3 and Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted
to the state of Rajasthan by the 1952 Act is as follows:
“3. Instruments chargeable with duty.—Subject to the
provisions of this Act and the exemptions contained in
Schedule I, the following instruments shall be chargeable
with duty of the amount indicated in that Schedule as the
proper duty therefore respectively, that is to say—
(a) every instrument mentioned in that Schedule which, not
having been previously executed by any person, is executed
in India on or after the day on which the Act comes into force
in the State of Rajasthan;
(b) every bill of exchange payable otherwise than on demand,
or promissory note drawn or made out of India on or after
that day and accepted or paid or presented for acceptance
or payment, or endorsed, transferred or otherwise negotiated,
in India; and
(c) every instrument (other than a bill of exchange or
promissory note) mentioned in that Schedule, which, not
having been previously executed by any person, is executed
out of India on or after that day, relates to any property situate,
or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in India and is
received in India:”
Schedule I of the central Act, as adapted to the state of Rajasthan,
reads as follows:

The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
24. From reading the above provisions, rules, and the Schedule together,
it can be seen that Section 2 of the 1952 Act provides that the Indian
Stamp Act, 1899 will apply in the state of Rajasthan subject to certain
adaptations. The relevant adaptations for our purpose are that
‘government’ shall refer to state government (as per Section 3(v) of
the 1952 Act) and that reference to Schedule I of the central Act shall
be construed as reference to the Second Schedule of the 1952 Act
(as per Section 3(vi) of the 1952 Act). The Second Schedule of the
1952 Act prescribes the rates of stamp duty on certain instruments.
However, since policies of insurance are specified in Entry 91 of List
I, only the Parliament has the legislative competence to prescribe
the rate of stamp duty to be imposed on them. Consequently, the
Second Schedule to the 1952 Act does not contain any entry on
rates of duty for policies of insurance, and rightly so. Rather, when
we read Entry 47(D) of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899
as adapted to the state of Rajasthan, we see that the rate that has
been prescribed under the central law has been adopted within the
state as well.
25. The power to levy and collect stamp duty is relatable to the legislative
competence of the state, followed by clear authority of law through
statutory prescription. Having recognised the legislative competence
of the state of Rajasthan, the state has the power to collect stamp
duty under Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted
to the state of Rajasthan that provides that an instrument shall be
chargeable with the duty of the amount indicated in the Schedule if
it is executed within the state of Rajasthan.
26. The mandate of Section 3 is also found in Rule 3 of the Rajasthan
Stamp Rules, 1955 that provides for “mode of payment”. Rule 3,
read with Rule 2(d), provides that the duty with which any instrument
is chargeable shall be paid by means of a stamp issued by the
state government. The relevant event flowing from Section 3 and
Rule 3 authorising the levy and imposition of stamp duty is the
execution of the policy of insurance within the state. The liability
to purchase the stamps from the state of Rajasthan is therefore
clear and unambiguous. Consequently, for instruments executed
within the state, the purchase of stamps from outside the state
will equate to evasion of stamp duty and the instrument will not
be ‘duly stamped’.
264 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
27. Differentiating VVS Rama Sharma (supra): The learned ASG has
placed reliance on the following portions of VVS Rama Sharma
(supra) to contend that the state government cannot demand that
insurance stamps must only be purchased from it for policies issued
within the state:
“29. In the case at hand, it has been stated in the
FIR that the Divisional Office of LIC, Varanasi has not
purchased the insurance stamps from the Treasury
Office of U.P. but the same were purchased from the
stamp vendors, outside of State, which caused loss to
the State exchequer to the tune of Rs 1,67,21,520.00 to
the State Government. So, the sole allegation against
the appellants is that they have purchased the insurance
stamps from outside the State of U.P. However, as we
have already noted that the said act of the appellants
cannot be said to be inconsistent with any provisions
of the Stamp Act or any other rules. So, the allegation
made in the FIR even if proved by the prosecution does
not constitute any offence.
32. It is wholly immaterial whether the appellants are
purchasing the insurance stamps from the State of U.P.
or from any other State. In fact, as mentioned earlier, Rule
115-A of the U.P. Stamp Rules itself declares that “Stamps
which are the property of the Central Government”. That
being the legal position, it is legally untenable to contend
that the insurance stamps must be purchased from the
State of U.P. only.”
(emphasis supplied)
28. These portions of the judgment must be seen in the context of the facts
and the law applicable in that case. While arriving at its conclusion,
this Court in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) interpretated Rule 115A of
the UP Stamp Rules, 194232 (these Rules were framed by the state
32 Rule 115A of the UP Stamp Rules, 1942 has been extracted in VVS Rama Sharma (supra), para 20 that
reads as follows:

follows:

government pursuant to rule-making powers given to states under
Sections 74 and 75 of the Indian Stamp Act, 189933) read with the
provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.34 It was held that since
the Stamp Rules have been framed under the central Act, their
scope is only to the extent provided in Sections 74 and 75 and they
cannot circumvent the provisions of the central Act.35 In these facts,
this Court held that the State of UP could not require that stamps
on insurance policies must only be purchased within the state and
cannot be validly purchased from other states.
29. The law under consideration in the facts of the present case is
different. In the present case, the imposition of stamp duty by the
state government is under the 1952 Act, which is a state law that
has been enacted under Entry 44 of List III, and has received
Presidential assent as contemplated under Article 254.36 Article
254(2) clearly stipulates that when a state law with respect to a
to the public through post offices e.g. Central excise revenue stamps, defence (or national) savings
stamps, shall be obtained by post offices from local and branch depots and sold to the public in the same
manner as ordinary postage stamps.
Tobacco excise duty labels and insurance agent licence fee stamps shall be sold to the public at local
and branch depots at which they are stocked.”
33 Sections 74 and 75 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 read as follows:
“74. Powers to make rules relating to sale of stamps. –– The State Government may make rules for
regulating–(a) the supply and sale of stamps an stamped papers,
(b) the persons by whom alone such sale is to be conducted, and
(c) the duties and remuneration of such persons:
Provided that such rules shall not restrict the sale of ten naye paise or five naya paise adhesive stamps.
75. Power to make rules generally to carry out Act. ––The State Government may make rules to carry
out generally the purposes of this Act, and may by such rules prescribe the fines, which shall in no case
exceed five hundred rupees, to be incurred on breach thereof.”
34 VVS Rama Sharma (supra), paras 18-23
35 ibid.
36 Article 254 of the Constitution reads as follows:
“254. Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made by the Legislatures of
States.—(1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of
a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law
with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of
clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature
of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature
of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.
(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the
Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament
or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State
shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail
in that State:
Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with
respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made
by the Legislature of the State.”
266 [2024] 5 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
matter in the Concurrent List is repugnant to the provisions of an
earlier law made by the Parliament or an existing law with respect
to that matter, then the law passed by the state shall prevail in that
state “if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President
and has received his assent”. The 1952 Act that occupies the field
in the present case has undisputedly received Presidential assent
and hence it prevails over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 so far as the
state of Rajasthan is concerned.37
30. This Court in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) did not consider any such
law enacted by the state legislature that received Presidential assent
and was applicable within the state over the central Act. Further, a
stamp duty is a tax,38 and hence under Article 26539, its levy and
collection must be by the ‘authority of law’40. In VVS Rama Sharma
(supra), there was no charging provision that was considered by the
Court that required the payment of stamp duty on insurance policies
to the government of UP. Rather, the case was concerned with the
interpretation of Rules framed by the state under the central Act.
Hence, the final conclusion in that case is differentiable on facts and
law from the present case.
31. Conclusions on this issue: We have undertaken a detailed analysis
of the provisions of the 1952 Act and the Rajasthan Stamp Rules,
1955 that impose stamp duty on insurance policies issued by the
appellant within the state. Section 3 of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as
adapted to the state of Rajasthan is the charging provision as per
which the appellant must pay stamp duty to the state government on
insurance policies executed within the state. The rate at which stamp
duty is payable on policies of insurance under the 1952 Act has been
adopted from Schedule I of the central Act, in accordance with Entry
91 of List I. The charging provision has thus been validly enacted by
the state government under Entry 44 of List III. Therefore, the state
government in the present case can impose stamp duty on the issuance

of insurance policies within its territory and require the payment of
such stamp duty by the appellant. Under these circumstances, the
commencement of proceedings for recovery of stamp duty under the
state law and the rules made thereunder is legal, valid, and justified.
IV. Liability of the Appellant in the Facts of the Present Case:
32. The learned ASG has relied on the letter by the Treasury Officer,
Jaipur dated 07.10.1991, the contents of which have been extracted
hereinunder:
“In reference to above it is to submit that Government
of India Insurance Stamp is the property of Central
Government, whose supply and distribution is not related
with this Department.”
33. From the contents of the letter, it is clear that the department
has admitted the non-availability of India Insurance stamps and
has also stated that it is not concerned with their supply and
distribution as they are the property of the central government.
The appellant submits that due to such representation by the
respondent-government, they were compelled to purchase the
stamps from Maharashtra, without which they could not have issued
the insurance policies in the state of Rajasthan. The High Court,
in the impugned judgment, has held that the correspondence of
the appellant with the department pertained to Agents License Fee
stamps.41 However, it has evidently not taken note of the letter
dated 07.10.1991 while arriving at such finding. The High Court
has therefore erred in this regard.
34. Further, the High Court has held that even if the stamps were
unavailable, the appellant was duty-bound to pay the stamp duty
to the state government in cash as provided under Section 3A(1)
of the 1952 Act.42 The relevant portions of Section 3A have been
extracted:
“3A. Payment of stamp duty in cash.— (1) Where the
State Government or the Collector under instructions of

Gazette, declares that adhesive or impressed stamps of
any denomination are not in stock for sale in sufficient
quantity; then, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act or the rules made thereunder and during the period
the said order remains in force,—
(i) any instrument chargeable with the stamp duty under
this Act may be executed on an unstamped paper;
(ii) the stamp duty chargeable on such instrument under
this Act may be paid to or collected by any Government
treasury in cash and a receipt or challan therefor shall be
duly given by the officer receiving the cash;
(iii) the officer-in-charge of the Government treasury
shall, as soon as may be, after the stamp duty chargeable
on any such instrument under this Act has been received
in cash, make on the instrument for which the stamp
duty has been paid in cash, the following endorsement,
after due verification that the stamp duty had been
paid in cash for such instrument, and after cancelling
such receipt or challan so that it cannot be used again,
namely:-
‘Stamp duty of Rs. ……………………paid in cash, vide
receipt/challan No. …………………….dated…………………
(iv) the instrument endorsed under clause (iii) shall be
deemed to be duly stamped under this Act and may be used
or acted upon as such to all intents and for all purposes;
Explanation.- For the purposes of sub-section (1)
“Government treasury” includes a Government sub-
treasury and any other place as the State Government may
by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.
***
(4) Nothing contained in this section shall apply to the
payment of stamp duty chargeable on the instruments
specified in entry 91 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution of India.”
35. However, the High Court entirely failed to consider sub-section (4),
[2024] 5 S.C.R. 269
Life Insurance Corporation of India v.
The State of Rajasthan and Ors.
despite quoting it, which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List
I from the application of Section 3A. Therefore, the High Court has
committed an error in holding that the appellant could have paid the
stamp duty in cash.
36. In view of the above circumstances, the appellant had no choice but
to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state. While it
made every endeavour to purchase the stamp from within the state,
due to the letter by the department and the lack of mechanism for
payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability
of insurance stamps, it was unable to purchase the stamps and pay
the stamp duty to the Rajasthan government.
37. Therefore, having considered the matter in detail, we finally hold that:
I. The preliminary issue relating to the applicability of the relevant
state law, i.e., the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act, is answered by
holding that the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952
applies to the present case.
II. We hold that the state legislature has the legislative competence
to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under
Entry 44 of List III, as per the rate prescribed by the Parliament
under Entry 91 of List I.
III. We hold that for the execution of insurance policies within the
state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to purchase India
Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of
Rajasthan.
IV. While we have upheld the power and jurisdiction of the state to
levy and collect stamp duty on insurance policies, in the facts
and circumstances of the case as indicated hereinabove, we
direct that the state government shall not demand and collect
the stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004,
11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.
38. In conclusion, we dismiss the appeals and affirm the judgment of

(Civil Appeal Nos. 1891-1966 of 2024)
21 March 2024
[J.B. Pardiwala* and Sandeep Mehta, JJ.]","It is the case of the respondent company herein that at the time
of booking the consignments, from Baad to Hisar via Palwal,
the notified chargeable distance for calculating freight as per the
Local Distance Table was 444 km, and accordingly the respondent
company paid the same from time to time. However, subsequently,
the appellant railways vide its letter dated 05.07.2005 changed
the chargeable distance to 334 km in the revised Local Distance
Table and the said revised table was to apply prospectively. The
respondent’s case is that the very chargeable distance of 444
km as per the old local distance table was wrong and demanded
refund of the difference of 110 km in the freight charges. The High
Court directed the railway administration to refund the difference
of approx. 110 km that was illegally levied towards the freight
charges. The following questions arise for consideration: (i) What

","Railways Act, 1989 – s. 106 – Scope of:
Held: Section 106 deals with notice for claim of compensation and
refund of overcharge – Section 106 of the Act, 1989 is in two-parts
* Author

and deals with and encompasses two distinct types of claims that
may be made or sought against the railway administration by way
of a notice: - (i) First¸ the claims towards the ‘compensation’ from
the railway administration which has been provided u/s.106 sub-
section (1) – The compensation may be sought in respect of any
loss or damage or destruction caused to the goods which were
being carried by the railway – (ii) Secondly, the claims towards the
refund of any ‘overcharge’ that has been levied in respect of any
goods which were being carried by the railways, and this has been
provided u/s. 106 sub-section (3) – Thus, Section 106 of Act, 1989
contains the statutory provisions that enables any person to make
a claim from the railway administration, either for (i) compensation
OR for (ii) refund of overcharge, in respect of any goods which
were being carried by the railway by sending a notice of claim – A
statutory time-period of 6-months has been provided for making a
notice of claim u/s. 106 of the Act, 1989, and if the notice of claim
is not made within the stipulated period, then the claim becomes
time-barred.[Paras 34, 35, 36, 39]
Railways Act, 1989 – s. 106 (3) – Meaning of Overcharge –
Notice for Claim for Refund of Overcharge – Conditions:
Held: The term “overcharge” has neither been defined in the Act,
1989 nor the erstwhile Act, 1890 – The term “overcharge” is derived
from the word ‘charge’ prefixed by the word ‘over’ and means
“something more than the correct amount or more than a certain
limit” – The Supreme Court in Union of India & Ors. v. West Coast
Paper Mills Ltd. & Anr. explained that an overcharge is something
in excess of what is due according to law, an overcharge must be
of the same genus or class as a charge, and it does not include
a sum that was collected but was not due – The Supreme Court
as-well as various High Courts have consistently held that the
rigours of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 will only be applicable
where the claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’ – Where the
claim for refund is for anything but an ‘overcharge’, Section 106(3)
of the Act, 1989 will not apply, and no notice of claim is required
– When it comes to a Notice for Claim for Refund of Overcharge
under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 the following conditions must
be fulfilled: - a) Claim must be for refund of an ‘Overcharge’; b)
Overcharge must have been paid to the Railway Administration
in respect of the goods carried by the railway; c) Notice must be
issued within 6-months from the date of payment or delivery of
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1053
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
goods for which overcharge was paid; d) Notice must be served
to the concerned railway administration to whom the overcharge
was paid – Thus, the rigours of Section 106 sub-section (3) i.e., the
6-month time period for making a notice of claim, is only attracted,
when the refund is for an overcharge. [Paras 43, 44, 45, 53, 59]
Railways Act, 1989 – What is the difference between an
“Overcharge” and an “Illegal Charge”:
Held: As to what would be an ‘overcharge’, the Supreme Court and
the various High Courts have consistently held that an ‘overcharge’
is any sum charged in excess or more than what was payable as per
law – Whereas an illegal charge is any sum which is impermissible
in law – For an excess sum to be an “overcharge” the sum paid
must partake the same character as the basic charge, or must
belong to the same genus of charge which was payable or required
to be paid by law – Whereas, for an illegal charge, the sum must
not have been payable by law – Another very fine but pertinent
distinction between an ‘overcharge’ and an ‘illegal charge’ is that,
an ‘overcharge’ is generally inter-se the specific parties involved
and in its peculiar facts – Whereas an ‘illegal charge’ is illegal for
everyone irrespective of the parties or facts. [Paras 60, 70, 71]
Railways Act, 1989 – Whether, the claim towards the refund of
difference of 110 km in freight charges is covered by Section
106 sub-section (3) of the Railways Act, 1989; In other words,
whether the claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’:
Held: The respondent company has undisputedly paid the freight
charges as per the notified chargeable distance, and nothing more
has been charged than what was at the time of booking of the
consignment required to be charged as per the law prevailing i.e.,
as per the old local distance table – The case of the respondent
company is not that it has paid anything in excess of what was
at the time of booking of the consignment required by law, rather,
the respondent’s case is that the charge which was required to
be paid by the law as prevailing at the time of booking of the
consignment was wrong – In other words, the respondent’s case
is that the very chargeable distance of 444 km as per the old local
distance table was wrong, and not that the distance for which the
respondent has been charged is incorrect in terms of the chargeable
distance that was notified at that time – Since admittedly, what
was charged from the respondent was as per the chargeable
1054 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
distance notified and required to be payable by law at that time
with nothing in excess, and since the respondent has challenged
the very basis or genus of the charge i.e., primary challenge is to
the chargeable distance of 444 km in itself and not the incidental
quantum of freight levied on the distance of 444 km, and because
the same was admittedly charged as per the prevailing law and
not due to any misapplication or mistake i.e., as per the old local
distance table, this clearly is not a case of overcharge and would
not fall within the four corners of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989.
[Paras 104, 105, 107]
Railways Act, 1989 – Whether the notified chargeable distance
of ‘444 km’ was an Illegal Charge or not?
Held: In the instant case, prima-facie it appears that under both;
the Old Distance Table and the New Distance Table, the actual
engineering difference was being taken into consideration, and the
only difference between the two methodologies lies in the rounding-
off – The effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable
distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110
km – There had been neither any change in the route by way of
addition of new station nor change in the physical track length of
the said route – The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that
the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an
error, and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated
07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology – There was failure
of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 444
km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law – There
is a concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and
the High Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance being
333.18 km – Thus, the said chargeable distance of 444 km was
illegal – No infirmity in the judgment and order passed by the High
Court. [Paras 126, 136, 137, 138]
Words and Phrases – Charge, Over, Illegal – discussed. [Para
61]
Interpretation of Statutes – Reasonableness or unreasonableness
of any provision:
Held: It is a settled law that in interpreting a statute or a rule, the
court must bear in mind that the legislature does not intend what
is unreasonable or impossible – If a rule leads to an absurdity or
manifest injustice from any adherence to it, the court can step
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1055
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
in – A statute or a rule ordinarily should be most agreeable to
convenience, reason and as far as possible to do justice to all – A
law/rule should be beneficial in the sense that it should suppress
the mischief and advance the remedy – In interpreting a rule,
it is legitimate to take into consideration the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of any provision – Gross absurdity must always
be avoided in a statute/rule – The expression reasonable means
rational, according to the dictate of reason and not excessive or
immoderate. [Para 82]
Railways Act, 1989 – s. 106 (3) – Hohfeld’s scheme of jural
relations:
Held: As per Hohfeld’s scheme of jural relations conferring of a
right on one entity must entail vesting of a corresponding duty
in another – Under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, the right of
consignee to seek a refund of an overcharge arises only when
there is a corresponding duty on the railway administration to
grant such refund i.e., when the notice of claim is made to it
within the statutory period – To seek a refund, certain condition
precedents need to be satisfied by the consignee before the right
can be said to accrue, namely, a) An overcharge has been paid
by the consignor to the Railway administration; b) A notice has
been served by the consignor to the Railway administration to
which overcharge has been paid; c) The consignor has served
the said notice within six months from the date of such payment
or the date of delivery of such goods at the destination station,
whichever is later – Thus, once the aforesaid conditions are
satisfied, the consignee’s “right to get a refund” can be said
to have as its jural correlative the “duty to grant refund” of the
Railway administration. [Paras 84, 84.1]
Railways Act, 1989 – Claim of refunds – Cautioning the courts
and the railway claims tribunal:
Held: Where the court or tribunal whilst examining a claim for
refund finds that a particular charge for which refund is sought
is not an overcharge, they must not jump to the conclusion
that the said charge then is an illegal charge – There may be
situations, where a charge for which refund is sought may not
be an overcharge or even an illegal charge and rather would be
a lawful charge perfectly valid in the eyes of law, or a charge
though valid but in the extant of equity may be refundable, the
same has to be determined upon appraisal of the entire facts of
1056 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the case – The courts and tribunal must be mindful of the fact that,
the question as to what is the nature of a particular charge, be it
overcharge or illegal charge or valid charge etc. is for ultimately
determining whether it is liable for refund or not, without jumping
to any conclusion. [Paras 95 and 96]

allowed all the abovementioned appeals filed by the respondent

to refund the difference of approx.. 110 km that was illegally levied
towards the freight charges.
A. FACTUAL MATRIX
2. The respondent company herein had booked various consignments
of furnace oil between the years 2002 & 2005 via railway from Baad
to Hisar route. Indisputably the freight for the same was calculated
by the appellant on the basis of a total chargeable distance of 444
km. as per the then prevailing distance table plying for the said route.
3. On 07.04.2004, the Ministry of Railways vide its Letter No.
TCR/2043/2002/2, decided to rationalize the method of calculating
the ‘chargeable distance’ between the pairs of station routes by way
of rounding off the aggregate of the ‘actual engineering distance’ to
the next higher kilometre only once at the end. The said letter is
reproduced below: -

REF: Board’s letter no. TCR/2043/2002/4 dated
05.02.2003
Reference is invited to Board’s above cited letter wherein
Zonal Railways were asked to print their new Local Distance
Tables (LD1) and Junction Distance Tables (JDT) effective
from April 1, 2003, indicating the actual engineering
1060 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
distances of the various sections upto two decimal places.
Board desire confirmation in this regard and that these books
have been printed and circulated to other railways also.
It was also indicated in the letter under reference that
the method of “rounding off” to be adopted for arriving
at the ‘chargeable distance’ shall be communicated in
due course. The Ministry of Railways have now decided
in rationalize the method for arriving at the ‘chargeable
distance’ between a specific pair of originating and
destination points. The actual engineering distances
upto two decimal places of the various sections from
originating station to destination station will be added
up and the distance so aggregated would be finally
rounded off to the next higher kilometre for deriving the
chargeable distance. It may be ensured that for deriving
the “chargeable distance”, the summation of individual
sectional distances be “rounded off” only once at the
end. This rationalization is aimed at ensuring uniformity
in the method of deriving the distance of charging fares
and freight for all customers across the Indian Railways.
In order to have a uniform date of implementation, all
railways shall change over to the rationalized procedure
with effect from 01.06.2004. As these instructions have
prospective effect and may result in variation in fares
and freights when compared with the existing fares
and freight, neither would any undercharges be raised
by the railways nor would the railways refund charges
collected in past cases. Rail users may be intimated
of the proposed changes well in advance and staff
may also be made well conversant with the changes
contemplated.
This issues in consultation with C&IS Directorate and with
the concurrence of Finance Directorate in the Ministry of
Railways.

4. This new methodology was being adopted in order to ensure uniformity
in deriving the chargeable distance for fares and freight across the
Indian Railways, and pursuant to it, the various zonal railways were
required to revise their respective distance tables accordingly.
5. The letter as referred to above specifically stipulated that, the change
over to the new ‘rationalized procedure’ shall take place w.e.f. 01.06.2004
and further that as the aforementioned change might result in variation
in the fares and freights in comparison to the then existing charges
/ rates, the said change would not entitle either the Railways or the
end-users to recover or seek any under-charge or excess charge that
was already paid prior to the implementation of the said policy.
6. However, since many zonal railways were yet to print and make
available their revised local distance tables and junction tables at
their respective stations by the scheduled date of implementation,
the Ministry of Railways vide its letter dated 24.09.2004 changed and
moved the date of implementation of the aforesaid new methodology
to 01.01.2005. It was further clarified that till the revised guidelines
were implemented, the chargeable distance would continue to be
calculated as per the earlier prevailing methodology and procedure
as applicable. The said letter reads as under: -

charged as under: -
1. Refinery BAAD to BAAD station 04 Km
2. BAAD to TKD 145 Km
3. TKD to HSR 295 Km
Total 444 Km
As revised distance table of NCR, NR were not received,
hence the charging was as per the earlier practice of 444

8. The respondent upon learning about the aforesaid letter dated
05.07.2005 changing the chargeable distance from 444 km to 334
km for the route from Refinery Baad to Hisar, made further inquiries
with the concerned Railway office & came to learn that, although
there had been no change in the physical track length for the said
route and that the actual distance from Baad to Hissar via Palwal
was in fact 333.18 km, yet the appellant was charging freight at a
wrong chargeable distance of 444 km for the same route.
9. In view of the aforesaid, the respondent company sent a notice of
claim dated 07.11.2005 under Section 78B of the erstwhile Railways
Act, 1890 (for short, the “Act, 1890”) to the appellant demanding
refund of the difference of 110 km in the freight charges that had
been erroneously charged on the basis of the wrong chargeable
distance which was subsequently changed.
10. The respondent vide the aforesaid notice of claim had demanded
refund for a total of 122 consignments for which freight had been
levied on the basis of a chargeable distance of ‘444 km’. However,
the appellant herein rejected all of the claims and declined to refund
the 110 km difference in freight charges.
B. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE RAILWAY CLAIMS TRIBUNAL
11. Aggrieved by the same, the respondent in all filed 122 claim
applications under Section(s) 13(1)(b) r.w. 16(1) of the Railway Claims
Tribunal Act, 1987 (for short, the “RCT Act”) for refund towards the
difference of 110 km in freight charges, with the lead application
being the OA/(III)/229/20006/Mathura before the Railway Claims
Tribunal, Ghaziabad (“RCT”).
12. During the pendency of the aforesaid claim applications, the
respondent company held meetings with the appellant more
particularly the General Manager, North Central Railway, Allahabad,
who upon scrutinizing the matter allowed refund for inasmuch as
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1065
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
45 (sic) claims (approx..), which had been made within the statutory
time period of 6-months under Section 78B of the Act, 1890 – now
Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 (for short, the “Act, 1989”).
13. The Railway Claims Tribunal, Ghaziabad vide its common final
judgement and order dated 26.12.2013, dismissed the remaining
77 claim applications of the respondent as being time-barred. The
said decision of the RCT is in two parts: -
(i) First, the RCT observed that though the chargeable distance
was only 334 km still the freight charges had been levied for
a distance of 444 km. This according to the Tribunal was a
case of excess payment of freight, and thus the refund that
was sought was for an ‘overcharge’. The relevant observations
read as under: -
“18. [...] In this case, the goods were booked from ‘A’
to ‘B’, showing the chargeable distance as 444 Kms.
and payment was given by the applicant company for
the same distance, but later on, Railways reworked
the chargeable distance as only 333.18 Kms. The
consignment in question was carried through the
same route. So, it is clear that the payment was to
be made for 333.18 Kms., whereas it was made for
444 Kms. In this way, the applicant company had
to pay for 444 Kms, instead of 333.18 Kms. Hence,
the present case is for the refund of this excess
payment of freight, which can only be termed as
refund of overcharge and nothing else and so, the
notice under Section 106(3) of the Railways Act,
1989 is necessary.”
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) Secondly, since the case at hand was one for refund of an
overcharge and the notice of claim had not been sent within the
prescribed time-period of 6-months as required under Section
106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim application was time-barred.
The relevant observations read as under: -
“24. [...] Furthermore, perusal of the record shows
that the applicant company had served a notice on
07.11.2005 upon the Respondent Railway, but the
1066 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
date of booking of the consignment in question was
25.08.2002. Hence, it has been revealed that the
said notice was time barred as per the provisions
of the aforesaid Section 106(3) of the Railways Act,
1989, which had been well within the knowledge of
the applicant company also as per the aforesaid letter
dated 28.01.2009. In this context, Ld. Counsel for the
Respondent has placed reliance on the case law, titled
as Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways &
Anr., 1995 SCC (2) 493. We have carefully perused
the said case law and it supports the contention of
the Respondent Railway.
xxx xxx xxx
26. In view of the above, it has been held the applicant
company has not served a valid and legal notice on
the Respondent Railway within the statutory period
under the provisions of Section 106(3) of the Railways
Act, 1989. As such, the applicant company is not
entitled for any compensation. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
14. Thus, the RCT, whilst dismissing the respondent’s claim applications
held that, the respondent’s claim was for a refund of an overcharge
and since the notice of claim was not served in terms of Section
106(3) of the Act, 1989, the claim was time-barred.
C. IMPUGNED ORDER
15. Aggrieved with the aforesaid, the respondent went in appeal under
Section 23 of the RCT Act before the High Court of judicature at
Allahabad. In all 76 First Appeals from Order were filed, with the
lead appeal being the FAO No. 843 of 2014 wherein the High
Court vide its judgement & order dated 23.02.2018 allowed the
aforesaid appeal, by placing reliance on the decision of this Court
in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. v. Union of India reported
in (2018) 17 SCC 729. The High Court took the view that since
in the case at hand the freight had been paid as per the notified
chargeable distance which was later found to be incorrect, it was a
case of “illegal charge” and not that of “overcharge”. The relevant
observations read as under: -
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1067
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
“[...] In this case, the freight was paid by the appellant as
per the notified distance and freight charges were paid
accordingly. However, later on it was revealed that the
distance was less and that is how the appellants had
claimed the amount. This was one of the facts on which
the Apex Court held in favour of the appellant (Hindustan
Petroleum) and this was a question of illegal realisation
of freight and not of over charging as submitted by the
counsel for the respondent. [...]
The finding of fact by the Tribunal dismissing the claim of
the claimant is bad in the eye of law as held by the Apex
Court in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra), there was no need
for issuance of notice. I am fortified in my view by both
the decisions of the Apex Court in Hindustan Petroleum
(Supra) and West Coast Paper Mills (Supra). Hence,
this is not a case of over charge at all as the freight was
paid as per the rates notified for certain distance. No other
view can be taken in this matter.
The judgment in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra) will enure
for the benefit of the appellant in this case also.
In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The respondents
to calculate the difference within 12 weeks from today and
pay the appellant.”
(Emphasis supplied)
16. Accordingly, the High Court vide the aforesaid judgement & order
dated 23.02.2018 disposed of the lead appeal of FAO No. 843 of
2014, and thereafter by a batch of common orders disposed of
the other 75 appeals in terms of its findings recorded in the final
judgement and order passed in the lead appeal.
17. The aforesaid order dated 23.02.2018 as passed in FAO No. 843 of
2014 i.e., the lead appeal was challenged and carried upto this Court
by way of the special leave petition being SLP (C) No. 3987 of 2021.
This Court vide its order dated 04.03.2021 refused to interfere with
the order dated 23.02.2018 passed in FAO No. 843 of 2014 as the
claim amount was very low. Thus, the said Special Leave Petition
came to be dismissed by this Court, however the question of law
was kept open. The relevant portion reads as under: -
1068 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“O R D E R
We decline to interfere in this Special Leave Petition, as
we find that the claimed amount is very low. The Special
Leave Petition is dismissed accordingly, leaving the
question of law open.”
18. In view of the aforesaid, the appellant herein being aggrieved, has
challenged the final orders passed by the High Court in the other 75
appeals involving a total sum of Rs. 1,55,03,652/- (approx.).
D. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
19. Mrs. Rukhmini Bobde, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant
in her written submissions has stated thus: -
“WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE
APPELLANT
1. The present Appeal has been filed against the final
judgement of the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad
a batch of First Appeals, whereby the Hon’ble High
Court has allowed all the abovementioned appeals
filed by the Respondent-IOCL while relying upon the
judgment dated 23.02.2018 passed in First Appeal
from Order No. 843 of 2014 (@pg. 79 of the present
Appeal) which is illegal and perverse as the Hon’ble
High Court has ignored to answer the questions of law.
It is submitted that the order dated 23.02.2018 in First
Appeal from Order No. 843 of 2014 was challenged
by the Appellant-Union before this Hon’ble Court and
the said petition bearing SLP(C) No. 3987 of 2021
was dismissed by this Hon’ble Court on 04.03.2021
on the ground that claim amount was very low. It is
however submitted that the claim amount of all the
batch matters herein comes to approximately Rs.
1,55,03,652/-.
2. The facts of the lead case herein are that the
Respondent-IOCL had sent a legal notice dated
07.11.2005 under Section 106 of the Railway Act,
1989 to the Appellant-Union for refund of excess
freight charges with respect to a consignment dated
25.08.2022, due to change in methodology, having
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1069
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
been applied prospectively from 01.01.2005 which
resulted in variation in fares and freights when
compared with the then existing fares and freight. It
is submitted that the present Appeal is not a case of
error in the existing notified freight change.
3. The case of the Appellant-Union is that Section 106 of
the Railway Act, 1989 does not apply to the present
case at all since as per the circulars dated 07.04.2004
and 24.09.2004 (@page 141 and 144 of the Appeal
respectively) issued by the Appellant-Union, the
change in distance happened due to rationalization
of the distances, aimed at ensuring uniformity in the
method of deriving the distance of charging fates
and freight for all customers across Indian Railways.
The rationalization was also directed to be applied
prospectively (from 01.01.2005 onwards) and the date
of transport of consignment was on 25.08.2002 i.e.
more than 2 years before application of the circular.
It is further submitted that the Appellant-Union in its
circular dated 07.04.2004 had specifically stated that
the Appellant-Union would not be raising any issue
of undercharges due to the variation nor was the
Petitioner going to refund the charges collected in
past cases, thus ensuring balance of convenience.
Therefore, the question of overcharging does not arise
at all as the Respondent-IOCL has been charged the
freight charges as per the then prevailing existing
fares and freights of the time and consequently,
the Respondent-IOCL cannot raise any claim for
compensation under Section 106 of the Railway
Act, 1989.
4. Even assuming and without admitting to the case
of the Respondent-IOCL, if the Respondent-IOCL
is able to present a case for being overcharged
and thus Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 to
be applicable, the case of the Respondent-IOCL is
barred from raising any claim as per the provisions
of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 on the
ground of delay.
1070 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
5. It is also pertinent to take a close look at the facts
of the following case laws:
a. In Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western
Railways and Another’, the Petitioner earlier
used to transport through metre-gauge from
the railway siding at Chanderia. However, after
conversion into broad-gauge the railway siding
was at Difthkola Chittor Broad-Gauge Rail Link,
which lead to an increase of 34 km, which was
added to the freight charges. The Petitioner had
belatedly raised its claim under Section 78-B of
the Railway Act, 1890 (pari materia to Section
106 of the Railways Act, 1989) and were thus
barred by limitation.
The principal contention raised by the Petitioner
was that it had discovered the mistake when
the railway authorities confirmed by their letter
that they had committed a mistake in charging
excess freight on wrong calculation of distance.
The limitation started running from the date of
discovery and therefore stands excluded and
that Section 78-B of the Railway Act, 1890 had
no application to the facts. However, this Hon’ble
Court held that since admittedly the claims of the
Petitioner were made under Section 78-B of the
Railway Act, 1890 beyond a period of six months,
the claim had become barred by limitation.
It should be mentioned that the facts of Birla
Cement would have only been applicable in
the present Petition if there was a case of
overcharging. However, as the Respondent
had booked according to the prevailing freight
charges at that time, the facts of Birla Cement
does not arise at all.
b. In Union of India and Others v. West
Coast Paper Mills Ltd and Another (III), the
Respondents were being charged a flat rate
irrespective of the commodity carried and were
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1071
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
not given the benefit of telescopic system of rates
which was allowed by the Railways to others.
This led to a scenario wherein the Respondents
had to pay freight on certain goods at three times
compared to what would have been payable in
case the benefit of telescopic system of rates
was allowed to them. This was construed to be
an illegal and unreasonable charge. Reference
is made to paragraph 20 of the Judgement:
“20. In the case at hand, the
freight rates notified by the Railway
Administration in exercise of its
statutory power to do so, so long as
they were not declared illegal and
unreasonable by the Tribunal under
Section 41 of the Act, were legal and
anyone carrying the goods by rail was
liable to pay the freight in accordance
with those rates. The freight paid by
the respondents was as per the rates
notified. Thus the present one is not
a case of overcharge at all. It is a
case of illegal recovery of freight on
account of being unreasonable and
in violation of Section 28 of the Act,
consequent upon such determination
by the Tribunal and the decision of
the Tribunal having been upheld by
this Court. A case of “illegal charge”
is distinguishable from the case of
“overcharge” and does not attract
the applicability of Section 78-B of
the Railways Act.”
The facts are different from the present case
as the Respondent-IOCL in the present case
was only being charged the notified rates as
per the prevailing rules at the time of booking.
The Respondent-IOCL was aware of the freight
charges at the time of booking.
1072 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
c. In Hindustan Petroleum Corporation
Limited v. Union of India’, the facts were
different from the present case as the Railways
had migrated to a computerized railway freight
charges system from a manual system, which
lead to decrease in the distance notified between
Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak,
Haryana and Partapur, District Meerut, Uttar
Pradesh.
It is submitted that this Hon’ble Court had
correctly held that there was no overcharge and
therefore Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989
is not applicable. However, it is most humbly and
respectfully submitted that as on merits there is
no discussion in law as to whether any refund
is payable dehors Section 106 of the Railways
Act, 1989.
In the present case, the Appellant-Union had
stated as per the circulars dated 07.04.2004
and 24.09.2004 that it would not be raising any
issue of undercharging nor would be providing
any refund and that the charges are prospective.
6. Therefore, it is requested to allow the present Appeal
and reverse the judgement of the Hon’ble High Court.”
E. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
20. Mr. Shashwat Goel, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
in his written submissions has stated thus: -
“WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE
RESPONDENT - M/S INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD
A. RESPONDENT’S CASE/ ARGUMENTS IN BRIEF
1. It is respectfully submitted that the present matter
pertains to ‘illegal charge’ / ‘illegal realization’ of the
freight amount by the Petitioner (i.e. the Railways)
from the Respondent oil company. Admittedly, the
Petitioner herein has charged the freight amount from
the Respondent for a distance of 444 km, instead of
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1073
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
333.18 km between ‘Baad’ (BAD) station to ‘Hissar’
(HSR) station. This is nothing but ‘illegal realization’
of freight from the Respondent and it cannot be
termed as ‘overcharge’. It is submitted that there is a
difference between ‘illegal realization’/ ‘illegal charge’
and ‘overcharge’ of freight amount. An ‘overcharge’
is something which is in excess of that what is due
according to law and is paid by a party on account
of mistake of fact. Whereas, ‘illegal realization’ /
‘illegal charge’ is excess realization of charges due
to change in ‘notified’ distance or rates.
2. It is submitted that the Petitioner has been calculating
the freight amount for a distance of 444 km as it
was ‘notified’ in the old distance table. Therefore,
this cannot be termed as overcharge. Admittedly,
upon realizing that the said distance was wrongly
calculated, the appropriate authority of the Petitioner
‘critically reviewed’ the old distance tables and
thereafter notified the corrected distance/ rate
between BAD to HSR as 333.18 km on 05.07.2005
(i.e. Annexure P-3 @ Pg. 146 of SLP). This notification
of corrected distance made the earlier realization of
freight for 444 km under the erstwhile notified rates,
illegal. Further, the cause of action for recovery of
such illegal realization’ of freight arose on 05.07.2005,
when the corrected distance was notified by the
Petitioner. Immediately, the Respondent filed its claim
petitions on 07.11.2005 for recovery of excess amount
for the extra distance which was illegally realized by
the Petitioner.
3. The present case is squarely covered by a judgment
of this Hon’ble Court passed in the matter of Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Union of India,
(2018) 17 SCC 729 (attached herewith). In the said
case, the Petitioner therein (i.e. Hindustan Petroleum
Corpn.) paid freight to the Railways (i.e. Petitioner
herein) for the notified distance of 125 km, between
the period 01.04.2008 to 30.09.2010. Subsequently,
the said distance of 125 km was corrected by the
1074 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Railway to 100 km on 27.02.2011. Immediately,
HPCL filed its claim petitions on 30.03.2011, which
were rejected as being time barred U/s 106(3) of the
Railways Act, 1989 by the Railways; Railways Tribunal
& the High Court. When the said matter reached this
Hon’ble Court, the Railways (i.e. the Petitioner herein)
placed reliance on the judgment of this Hon’ble Court
in Birla Cement Works, (1995) 2 SCC 493 to buttress
its argument that the claims filed by HPCL were
barred U/s 106(3) of the Railways Act. It is submitted
that the said judgment of Birla Cement Works was
distinguished by this Hon’ble Court and it was held
that excess realization of freight by the Railways
from HPCL was ‘illegal’ and therefore HPCL’s claims
were allowed. It was further held that there was no
requirement of giving any notice under Section 106
of the Railways Act as there was no overcharge by
the Railways. The findings of this Hon’ble Court in
HPCL’s case are as follows:
“8. Birla Cement Works [Birla Cement
Works v. Western Railways, (1995) 2
SCC 493] was a case where the petitioner
therein (i.e. Birla Cement Works) came
to know of the alleged excess amount of
freight on wrong calculation of distance
through a letter dated 12-10-1990 issued
by the Railway authorities. This primary
fact is conspicuously absent in the present
case. In the present case what was paid
was as per the fixed rate on the basis of
notified distance which subsequently was
corrected by another Notification upon
introduction of the Terminal Mechanism
System (TMS) at Asaudah Railway Station,
District Rohtak, Haryana.
9. On the other hand, in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd.
[Union of India v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd., (2004) 3
SCC 458] this Court in para 20 of the said Report took the
view that as the freight paid was as per the rates notified
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1075
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
the case would not be one of overcharge at all. If that is
the view taken by this Court on an interpretation of the
pari materia provision in the erstwhile Act i.e. the Railway
Act, 1890 (i.e. Section 78-B) we do not see why, in the
facts of the present case which are largely identical, we
should be taking any other view in the matter.
10. Consequently and in the light of the above, we allow
the present appeals, set aside the order of the High Court
as well as that of the Railway Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh
and allow the claims of the appellant which will be paid
forthwith on due and proper calculation.”
B. SUBMISSIONS ON THE ISSUES FRAMED BY THIS
HON’BLE COURT
Issue No.1 - What is the scope of Section 106 of the
Railway Act, 1989, and if the said provision is applicable
to the present case at hand?
(i) It is submitted that Section 106 of the Railways
Act, 1989 stipulates that a ‘Notice has to be sent
to the Railways within six months for : (a) ‘claim for
compensation’ (under sub-section (1) & (2)); & (b)
for ‘refund of overcharge’ (under sub-section (3)).
It is clear from a bare reading of this section that a
notice cannot be sent to the Railways for any other
purpose/ for raising a claim under any other head
which is not mentioned in the said section. The
term(s) ‘illegal charge’ / ‘illegal realization of freight’
is not mentioned in S.106. Therefore, there is no
legal requirement of sending a notice under S.106
for raising a claim on account of ‘illegal charge’ /
‘illegal realization’ of freight. It is pertinent to mention
here that a claim of illegal charge’ will not fall under
the category of overcharge as undisputedly, there is
a difference between the terms - ‘overcharge’ and
‘illegal charge’.
(ii) In this regard, reliance is placed upon a judgment of
this Hon’ble Court passed in the matter of Union of
India & Ors. v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. & Anr. (IlI),
1076 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(2004) 3 SCC 458 (attached herewith). In the said
case, an interpretation of the pari materia provision
(like S.106) in the erstwhile Act i.e. the Railway Act,
1890 (i.e. Section 78-B) was done by this Hon’ble
Court. While considering the distinction between an
‘overcharge’ and ‘illegal charge’ for the purposes of
Section 78-B of the Railways Act, 1890 (i.e. same as
Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989), it was held
by this Hon’ble Court that :
“20. ........ A case of “illegal charge” is distinguishable
from the case of “overcharge” and does not attract
the applicability of Section 78-B of the Railways Act.”
It is pertinent to mention here that this Hon’ble Court
has also analysed in detail the meaning of the term
‘overcharge’ in Para 19 of the above-mentioned
judgment.
(iii) It is reiterated that the present matter pertains
to ‘illegal charge’ / ‘illegal realization’ and not of
overcharge’ of the freight amount. Therefore, in view
of the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted that the
provision of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989
is not applicable upon the present case. In this
regard, reliance is also placed upon paras 8-10 of the
judgment of this Hon’ble Court passed in Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited’s case (supra).
Issue No.2 - Whether the decision of this Court in Birla
Cement Works vs. G.M. Western Railways (1995) is
applicable to the case at hand?
(i) It is respectfully submitted that the decision of this
Hon’ble Court in Birla Cement Works is not applicable
upon the present case. Pertinently, the said decision
has already been distinguished by this Hon’ble Court
in the subsequent case of Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation Limited (supra), which is identical to the
present case.
(ii) The case of Birla Cement Works pertains to refund
of ‘overcharge’ which was made by the Railways.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1077
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Whereas, the present case is that of recovery of
‘illegally realized’ freight from the Railways.
(iii) In the case of Birla Cement Works, the Railways had
charged excess freight from the Petitioner therein (i.e.
Birla Cement), than what was stipulated in distance
table (i.e. overcharge). Whereas, in the present case,
the Railways (i.e. the Petitioner) had realized the
freight amount from the Respondent on the basis
of the distance, i.e. 444 km, that was notified in the
erstwhile distance table which subsequently got
corrected & was notified by the Railways as 333.18
km (i.e. illegal realization of freight).
(iv) In the case of Birla Cement Works, the Petitioner
therein (i.e. Birla Cement) came to know of the
alleged excess amount of freight on account of
wrong calculation of distance through the letter
issued by the Railways. It was not the case where
the distance was corrected and re-notified by the
Railway authorities. In Birla Cement Works, there
was a mistake by the Railways in calculating the
freight amount by wrongly taking into account the
distance that was stipulated in the distance table
in that case. It is submitted that the said mistake/
error was of such a nature that even the Petitioner
therein (i.e. Birla Cement) could have also found,
had it been diligent. Instead, it kept paying the
freight charges to the Railways and filed its claim
only when the Railways informed it that the same
was wrongly calculated. Whereas, in the present
case, the Respondent has paid the freight charges
as per the distance of 444km notified in the erstwhile
distance table, which later on stood corrected;
notifying the distance as 333.18 km. In the present
case, Respondent was not sleeping over its rights.
The Respondent filed its claims soon after the
corrected distance was notified by the Petitioner
herein and the Respondent came to know about the
illegal charge. There is no sort of lack of vigilance or
bona fides of the Respondent in the present case.
1078 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Issue No.3 - What was the reason for revising the freight
charges? In other words, whether the revision of freight
charges was done pursuant to a new methodology being
adopted or due to an error in the existing notified freight
charges?
(i) It is submitted that the freight charges/ the distance
between BAD station to HSR station was revised
/ corrected by the Petitioner vide its notification
dt.05.07.2005 (Annexure P-3 @Pg.146 of the SLP).
The said revision/ correction was carried out after
‘critically reviewing’ the old distance tables with the
revised distance tables of the North Central Railways
(NCR). It is clearly stated in the said notification that
the earlier notified distance of 444 km was used for
calculating the freight as the revised distance table
of NCR, despite being available, was not received
earlier. This clearly shows lapses on part of the
Petitioner. Despite being aware that the revised
distance tables had come for the NCR, the same
were not considered and the Petitioner continued
calculating the freight as per the old distance, which
is illegal.
(ii) It is further submitted that there is no change in the
tracks or route from BAD to HSR. It appears that the
wrong distance was notified in the old table, that is
why there was a need to critically review the same
before notifying the corrected distance.
4. It is pertinent to mention here that the Petitioner has
made a subtle attempt to mislead this Hon’ble Court
by introducing circulars dt.07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 in
its SLP. The Petitioner has used the said circulars to
erroneously allege that the change of distance was to
be applied prospectively from date mentioned in the
said circulars. In this regard it is submitted that the
said circulars do not pertain to change of distance.
The said circulars stipulate the guidelines for rounding
off the chargeable distance upto two decimal places.
Even the file no. of the said circulars is completely
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1079
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
different from the notification issued on 05.07.2005,
whereby the corrected rates were notified between
BAD & HSR. The file no. of the circulars dt. 07.04.2004
& 24.09.2004 is TCR/2043/2000/2, whereas, for the
notification dt.05.07.2005, it is DRM/CLAOG RAD/
Distance Table/2004/20. It is submitted that this fact
in itself makes it clear that the subject matter of the
circulars dt. 07.04.2004 & 24.09.2004 and notification
dt.05.07.2005 are totally distinct and separate and the
said circulars have no bearing upon the present case.
5. It is also pertinent to mention here that there is an
unexplained delay of 661 days in filing the SLP by
the Petitioner.
In the light of the aforementioned submissions, it
is humbly prayed that the present SLP filed by the
Petitioner be dismissed.”
F. ANALYSIS
21. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
having gone through the materials on record, the following pivotal
questions fall for our consideration: -
I. What is the scope of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the
Railways Act, 1989? In other words, what constitutes an
“overcharge” within the meaning of Section 106 sub-section
(3) of the Railways Act, 1989? What is the difference
between an “Overcharge” and an “Illegal Charge”?
II. Whether, the claim towards the refund of difference of 110
km in freight charges is covered by Section 106 sub-section
(3) of the Railways Act, 1989? In other words, Whether
the claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’?
III. Whether, the difference of 110 km in freight is liable to be
refunded? In other words, whether the notified chargeable
distance of ‘444 km’ was an Illegal Charge or not?
i. Relevant Statutory Scheme and Provisions
22. Earlier, in India the law pertaining to the railways was scattered into
several enactments and executive orders, each regulating different
aspects of the railways throughout the country. The reason behind
1080 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the multiple different legislations on the railways was the number of
changes that were rapidly taking place due to the expansion and
establishment of various railway corridors across the country.
23. The Indian Railways Act, 1890 was the first prominent legislation to
be passed to consolidate the law and embody all important provisions
relating to the railways. The Act, 1890 since its enactment remained
the sole substantive legislation for regulating railways in India for
nearly half a century.
24. Despite being amended several times, the Act, 1890 was not able
to keep pace with the changes that were rapidly taking place in the
Indian railway infrastructure and network. Over the course of time,
several committees were constituted with a view to streamline the
functioning of Indian Railways and meet the challenges of changing
times. Various recommendations were made to the Government by
these committees, with the most significant one being the complete
reorganization of the railway into several operational zones.
25. Due to large and sweeping nature of the changes recommended, the
Act, 1890 required an extensive revision, something which could not
be done by amendment, and thus, a new exhaustive Act was required
for the consolidation and nationalization of the Indian Railways.
26. Accordingly, the Railways Act 1989 came to be enacted with a view
to amend and consolidate the legislation relating to the Railways and
to replace the erstwhile Indian Railways Act, 1890. The statement of
objects and reasons of the Act, 1989 reads as under: -
“STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
The Indian Railways, Act, 1890 was enacted at a time
when the railways in India were mostly managed by
private companies. The Government of India primarily
played the role of a coordinating and regulating authority
in various matters, such as inter-railway movement of
traffic, fixation of rates, sharing of revenue, earnings of
through traffic, apportionment of claims liability amongst
the railways, providing reasonable facilities to passenger
and goods traffic, etc. This role was accordingly reflected
in the Act. But now, except for a very small portion of the
railways, the entire railway system has become part of
the Government of India. To give effect to the changes
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1081
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
in the railway system from time to time, the Act had also
undergone changes number of times since its enactment
in 1890. In addition, as some of the original provisions
enacted in 1890 had continued without any change, a need
for their replacement by new provisions more responsive
to the needs of the present day was felt and some other
provisions have become redundant. There has also been
a demand, both within and outside Parliament, for the
re-enactment of the Act so as to reflect the large number
of changes that have occurred in the railways. It has,
therefore, become necessary to consolidate and amend
the law relating to railways by a new act.
2. The Bill, while giving effect to the changes that are
necessary due to the change of circumstances, provides,
among other things, for the following matters, namely: -
(i) The railways are being administered by zonal
railways. This position had not been given effect to in
the Act. The Bill provides for the constitution of railway
zones, abolition of existing zones and appointment
of General Managers as heads of these railways
administrations.
(ii) Power has been given to the Central Government to
fix the rates for the carriage of passengers and goods
over the railways instead of the existing provisions
to fix only the maximum and minimum rates for such
carriage and leaving the fixation of specific rates to
the railway administrations. In addition, the railway
administrations are also being authorised to specify
lump sum rates for the carriage of goods.
(iii) In accordance with certain judicial pronouncements,
the Bill provides for statutory recognition of the railway
receipt as a negotiable instrument.
(iv) The Bill specifically provides for limiting the monetary
liability of railway administrations in respect of
payment of compensation of loss, damage, etc. of
goods. Provision has, however been made for full
liability subject to the condition that the consignor
while entrusting the goods to a railway administration
1082 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
for carriage, should declare the value of the goods
and pay a percentage charge on such value.
(v) The offences included in the Act have been rationalised
and a few new offences have also been included in
the Bill. Punishment for some of the offences had
not been changed since the enactment of the Act.
Penalties provided for the offences under the Act
have been made more stringent which would include,
among other things, a minimum punishment for many
of the offences.
3. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects.”
(Emphasis supplied)
27. The Act, 1989 is a consolidating and amending legislation relating
to the Railways which received assent and came into force on
03.06.1989 replacing the erstwhile Act, 1890 by virtue of the repealing
provision contained in Section 200 of the Act, 1989. The Act, 1989
is divided into 16 Chapters and 200 Sections. Chapter XI of the Act,
1989 sets out the provisions (Section(s) 93 to 112) relating to the
Responsibilities of Railway Administration as Carriers, and it deals
with claims for refund and compensation in respect of the goods
carried by railway.
28. In addition to the aforesaid statute, the Railway Claims Tribunal Act,
1987 was also enacted for the establishment of the Railway Claims
Tribunal with a view to provide the procedural framework and forum
for inquiry, determination and adjudication of claims against the
railway administration. The statement of objects and reasons of the
RCT Act reads as under: -
“STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
An Act to provide for the establishment of a Railway
Claims Tribunal for inquiring into and determining claims
against a railway administration for loss, destruction,
damage, deterioration or non-delivery of animals or goods
entrusted to it to be carried by railway or for the refund of
fares or freight or for compensation for death or injury to
passengers occurring as a result of railway accidents or
untoward incidents] and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto.”
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1083
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
29. Section 13 of the RCT Act provides that the Railway Claims Tribunal
shall inter-alia exercise powers and jurisdiction under Chapter VII of
the erstwhile Act, 1890 (now Chapter XI of the Act, 1989) pertaining
to inquiry and determination of claims for compensation for loss,
destruction, damage etc. and claims for refund of freight etc. in
respect of goods carried by railway. The said provision reads as
under: -
“13. Jurisdiction, powers and authority of Claims

railway administration to be carried by railway.
(1A) The Claims Tribunal shall also exercise, on and from
the date of commencement of the provisions of section
124A of the Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989), all such
jurisdiction, powers and authority as were exercisable
immediately before that date by any civil court in respect
of claims for compensation now payable by the railway
administration under section 124A of the said Act or the
rules made thereunder.

(2) The provisions of the Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989)
and the rules made thereunder shall, so far as may be, be
applicable to the inquiring into or determining, any claims

(Emphasis supplied)
30. Section 15 of the RCT Act bars the jurisdiction of courts and other
authorities from entertaining or exercising any power in respect of
matters referred to in Section 13 of the RCT Act. The said provision
reads as under: -
“15. Bar of jurisdiction. —
On and from the appointed day, no court or other authority
shall have, or be entitled to, exercise any jurisdiction,
powers or authority in relation to the matters referred to
in sub-sections (1), (1A) and (1B) of section 13.”
31. Section 16 of the RCT Act provides that an application may be made
to the Railway Claims Tribunal for any claim of compensation or
refund from the railway administration as provided under Section
13 of the said Act. The said provision reads as under: -
“16. Application to Claims Tribunal. —
(1) A person seeking any relief in respect of the matters
referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (1A) of
section 13 may make an application to the Claims
Tribunal.
(2) Every application under sub-section (1) shall be in
such form and be accompanied by such documents
or other evidence and by such fee in respect of the
filing of such application and by such other fees for

Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
section (1) or, as the case may be, sub-section (1A)] of
section 13.”
32. Section 23 of the RCT provides for a statutory appeal on both a
question of fact and law, to the High Court against any order passed
by the Railway Claims Tribunal. The said provision reads as under: -
“23. Appeals. —
(1) Save as provided in sub-section (2) and notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (5 of 1908) or in any other law, an appeal shall

of the Claims Tribunal, to the High Court having
jurisdiction over the place where the Bench is located.
(2) No appeal shall lie from an order passed by the
Claims Tribunal with the consent of the parties. (3)
Every appeal under this section shall be preferred
within a period of ninety days from the date of the
order appealed against.”
33. Section 17 sub-section (2) of the RCT Act inter-alia provides that
no application for claim of compensation or refund from the railway
administration shall be entertained by the tribunal, until the expiry of
three-months from the date on which the notice of claim was made
in accordance with Section 78B of the erstwhile Act, 1890 (now
Section 106 of the Act, 1989). The said provision reads as under: -
“17. Limitation. —
(1) The Claims Tribunal shall not admit an application
for any claim—
(a) under sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section
(1) of section 13 unless the application is made

goods in question were entrusted to the railway
administration for carriage by railway;
(b) under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section
(1) 3[or, as the case may be, sub-section (1A)]

1086 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(c) under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section
13 unless the application is made within three
years from the date on which the fare or freight
is paid to the railway administration:
Provided that no application for any claim referred
to in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of
section 13 shall be preferred to the Claims Tribunal
until the expiration of three months next after the
date on which the intimation of the claim has been
preferred under section 78B of the Railways Act.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),
an application may be entertained after the period
specified in sub-section (1) if the applicant satisfies
the Claims Tribunal that he had sufficient cause for
not making the application within such period.”
ii. Scope of Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989
34. In the present lis, we are concerned with Section 106 of the Act,
1989, which is pari-materia to Section 78B of the erstwhile Act, 1890.
Section 106 deals with notice for claim of compensation and refund
of overcharge. The said provision reads as under: -
“106. Notice of claim for compensation and refund of
overcharge. –
(1) A person shall not be entitled to claim compensation
against a railway administration for the loss,
destruction, damage, deterioration or non-delivery
of goods carried by railway, unless a notice thereof
is served by him or on his behalf,—
(a) to the railway administration to which the goods
are entrusted for carriage; or
(b) to the railway administration on whose railway the
destination station lies, or the loss, destruction,
damage or deterioration occurs.
within a period of six-months from the date of
entrustment of the goods.
(2) Any information demanded or enquiry made in writing
from, or any complaint made in writing to, any of the
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1087
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
railway administrations mentioned in sub-section (1)
by or on behalf of the person within the said period
of six months regarding the non-delivery or delayed
delivery of the goods with particulars sufficient to
identify the goods shall, for the purpose of this section,
be deemed to be a notice of claim for compensation.
(3) A person shall not be entitled to a refund of an
overcharge in respect of goods carried by railway
unless a notice therefor has been served by him or
on his behalf to the railway administration to which the
overcharge has been paid within six months from the
date of such payment or the date of delivery of such
goods at the destination station, whichever is later.”
35. A close reading of the aforesaid provision would indicate that Section
106 of the Act, 1989 is in two-parts and deals with and encompasses
two distinct types of claims that may be made or sought against the
railway administration by way of a notice: -
(i) First¸ the claims towards the ‘compensation’ from the railway
administration which has been provided under Section 106
sub-section (1). The compensation may be sought in respect of
any loss or damage or destruction caused to the goods which
were being carried by the railway.
(ii) Secondly, the claims towards the refund of any ‘overcharge’
that has been levied in respect of any goods which were being
carried by the railways, and this has been provided under
Section 106 sub-section (3).
36. Thus, Section 106 of Act, 1989 contains the statutory provisions that
enables any person to make a claim from the railway administration,
either for (i) compensation OR for (ii) refund of overcharge, in respect
of any goods which were being carried by the railway by sending
a notice of claim.
37. Apart from containing the enabling provision for making a claim,
Section 106 further provides when such a claim may be made.
Section 106 sub-section (1) provides that a claim for compensation
may be made where there has been a loss or damage or destruction
or deterioration or non-delivery of the goods that were being carried
by the railway. Whereas, Section 106 sub-section (2) provides that a
1088 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
claim for refund may be made where there has been an overcharge
in respect of the goods carried and the said overcharge was paid to
the railway administration.
38. Lastly, Section 106 also provides how a claim may be made and the
mode & manner in which the notice must be made by stipulating a
pre-condition in the form of a prescribed time-limit for making any
claim thereunder: -
(i) Section 106 sub-section (1) prescribes twin-conditions for a
Notice of Claim for Compensation and provides that such notice
must be made within a period of 6-months from the date of
entrustment of goods AND the notice must be served to the
Railway Administration to whom the goods were entrusted.
(ii) Similarly, Section 106 sub-section (3) also stipulates twin-
conditions for making a Notice of Claim for Refund of Overcharge
and provides that such notice must be made within a period of
6-months from either the date of payment of such overcharge
or the date of delivery of the goods in respect of which the
overcharge was paid AND that the notice must be served to
the railway administration to whom the overcharge was paid.
39. Thus, a statutory time-period of 6-months has been provided for
making a notice of claim under Section 106 of the Act, 1989, and
if the notice of claim is not made within the stipulated period, then
the claim becomes time-barred.
40. The High Court of Gujarat in its decision in Shah Raichand Amulakh
v. Union of India & Ors. reported in (1971) 12 GLR 93 had observed
that the object behind the time-limit prescribed under Section 78B of
the 1890 Act (now Section 106 of the Act, 1989) is to prevent stale
or dishonest claims from being made, which if otherwise allowed
would make it difficult to enquire into their merits due to lapse of
time. The relevant observations read as under: -
“3. [...] the object of service of notice under this provision
clearly is to enable the railway administration to make an
inquiry and investigation as to whether the loss, destruction
or deterioration was due to the consignor’s laches or to the
wilful neglect of the railway administration and its servants
and further to prevent stale and possibly dishonest claims
being made when, owing to delay, it may be practically
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1089
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
impossible to trace the transaction or check the allegations
made by the consignor or the consignee. It is, therefore,
apparent that the provision requiring that notice of claim
must be given within six months even where the claim
is for refund of an overcharge in respect of animals or
goods carried by railway is intended to prevent stale and
perhaps dishonest claims being made when, by reason
of lapse of time, it may not be possible to inquire and find
out whether the claim made is well-founded or not. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
41. Shah Raichand Amulakh (supra), further held that the term
“overcharge in respect of carriage of goods” used in Section 78B of
the 1890 Act (now Section 106 of the Act, 1989) means and includes
all such charges that are related to the railway’s carrier business and
those which are incidental to the carriage of the goods by railway
irrespective of whether they are incurred prior to or subsequent to
the railway transit, and thus would include loading and unloading of
goods. The relevant observations read as under: -
“3. [...] To bring the claim for refund within the mischief
of the section, the overcharge must be in respect of
goods carried by railway. The words “carried by railway”
qualify goods and if any overcharge is recovered in
respect of goods which satisfy this description, it would
be “overcharge” by the railway administration in respect
of demurrage and wharfage charges, it is according to the
plain and natural meaning of the words, an overcharge in
respect of goods which are carried by railway. 1 do not
think it is possible to limit the ambit and coverage of the
section by reading the words “overcharge in respect of
goods carried by railway” as indicating that the overcharge
must be in respect of carriage of the goods. To read these
words in such a manner would be to refuse to give effect
to their plain natural meaning and to rewrite the section by
substituting some such words as “overcharge in respect
of carriage of goods.” That would be clearly impermissible
under any cannon of construction.
4. [...] Demurrage and wharfage charges are thus
clearly terminal charges and though it is true that they
1090 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
are charges in respect of the period subsequent to
the completion of the transit, all the same, they are
incidental to the business of the railway administration
as a carrier. These charges are, therefore, not unrelated
to the business of a carrier carried on by the railway
administration. The railway administration makes these
charges because there is delay in unloading the wagon or
removing the goods from the platform. These are clearly
charges in respect of the goods carried by railway as
much as freight and other charges. If, therefore, there
is any overcharge made by the railway administration
in respect of demurrage and wharfage charges, a claim
for its refund would clearly come within the scope and
ambit of Section 77. It would be a claim for refund of an
overcharge in respect of goods carried by railway within
the meaning of that section.”
(Emphasis supplied)
42. The Orissa High Court in Union of India & Ors. v. Steel Authority
of India Ltd. reported in (1996) SCC OnLine Ori 60, while examining
Section 78B of the Act, 1890, made the following pertinent
observations which are reproduced as under: -
“12. [...] What this section provides for is, apart from
claim for compensation for the loss, a claim for refund of
overcharge to a person in respect of animals or goods
carried by the Railways. The condition precedent for making
such a refund is that the person should have preferred
a claim in writing for such overcharge or compensation
within six months of the date of delivery of the animals or
goods for being carried by the Railway.”
(Emphasis supplied)
43. Thus, it can be seen from above that when it comes to a Notice for
Claim for Refund of Overcharge under Section 106(3) of the Act,
1989 the following conditions must be fulfilled: -
a. Claim must be for refund of an ‘Overcharge’,
b. Overcharge must have been paid to the Railway Administration
in respect of the goods carried by the railway
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1091
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
c. Notice must be issued within 6-months from the date of payment
or delivery of goods for which overcharge was paid, and
d. Notice must be served to the concerned railway administration
to whom the overcharge was paid.
44. Thus, the rigours of Section 106 sub-section (3) i.e., the 6-month time-
period for making a notice of claim, is only attracted, when the refund
is for an overcharge. Whenever, an application is made under Section
16 of the RCT Act for refund, what needs to be seen is whether the
same is for a refund of an overcharge or not? If the claim is for an
overcharge, Section 106 sub-section (3) would be applicable.
a. What is meant by an “Overcharge”?
45. At this stage, it would be apposite to understand what is meant by
the term “overcharge” used in Section 106 of the Act, 1989. The
term “overcharge” has neither been defined in the Act, 1989 nor the
erstwhile Act, 1890. The term “overcharge” is derived from the word
‘charge’ prefixed by the word ‘over’ and means “something more than
the correct amount or more than a certain limit”. The Black’s Law
Dictionary has defined “overcharge” as follows [See: Henry Campbell
Black on ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’, 4th Edn., 1968 at Pg. 1610]: -
“an exaction, impost, or incumbrance beyond what is just
and right or beyond one’s authority or power.”
46. The Law Lexicon has defined the term “overcharge” as “a charge
of a sum, more than is permitted by law”. [See, P. Ramanatha Aiyar
on ‘The Law Lexicon’, 2nd Edn., 1997 at Pg. 1389].
47. The term “overcharge” as used in Section 78B of the Act, 1890 (now
Section 106 of the Act, 1989) was first interpreted by the Gujarat
High Court in Shah Raichand Amulakh (supra) to mean any charge
in excess of what is prescribed or permitted or due by law. It was
further held, that for a sum to be an overcharge, it must be of the
same character as the charge itself or of the same genus of charge.
Accordingly, the High Court held that the demurrage and wharfage
charges that had been levied on a consignment in excess of what
was permissible under the law was an overcharge under Section
78B. The relevant observations read as under: -
“2. [...] “Overcharge” is not a term of Article It is an
ordinary word of the English language which according
1092 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to its plain natural sense means any charge in excess of
that prescribed or permitted by law. To be an overcharge,
a sum of money must partake of the same character as
the charge itself or must be of the same genus of or class
as a charge; it cannot be any other kind of money such
as money recovered where nothing is due. Overcharge is
simply a charge in excess of that which is due according
to law.”
(Emphasis supplied)
48. In yet another decision of the Gujarat High Court in Union of India
v. Mansukhlal Jethalal reported in (1974) SCC OnLine Guj 12 the
scope of Section 78B of the Act, 1890 (now Section 106 of the Act,
1989) came to be examined. In the said case, the Railway besides
the freight was levying new charge in the form of shunting charges
etc. It was contended that since, the freight encompassed the
terminal charges for shunting, the additional charges being levied
was arbitrary and illegal. The High Court held that since the additional
charges were not being levied in excess of the prescribed charges,
but were an altogether a different charge, the same could not be
termed as an overcharge and thus, Section 78B of the Act, 1890
was not attracted and no notice of claim was required. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“2. The trial Court has held that it has got jurisdiction to
entertain this suit. It is also held that no claim notice as
contemplated under Section 78-B of the Indian Railways
Act, 1890 (which will be hereinafter referred to as “the Act”),
was necessary as it was not a case of recovery of over
charges. Non-giving of such a notice, therefore, was not
fatal to the suit. The material averments made in the plaint
are, that the plaintiff booked salt from Kuda Salt Siding
Station, on the line of Western Railway Administration,
owned and represented by the Union of India (original
defendant), to salt merchants at Dhrangadhra and at
various other stations. That the said salt consignments
are booked in wagon loads from Kuda Salt Siding Station.
In para 12 it is averred that since 1-6-1961 the Western
Railway Administration, in addition to charging usual
freight on goods, traffic from and to Kuda Salt Siding
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1093
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Station, wrongly, illegally, arbitrarily and unreasonably
levied an additional new charge by- way of siding charges
or shunting charges or placement of wagon charges or
removal of wagon charges. In paras 13 to 18, reference is
made regarding the increases made, in those charges from
time to time and such collections made. In para 26, it is
averred that the, defendant Western Railway Administration
charged freight on the wagon load salt consignment of the
plaintiff from Kuda Salt Siding Station to destination and
the said freight includes terminal charges for shunting,
placement and removal of wagons at the place where, the
salt, to be loaded, is stacked and hence the defendant-
Western Railway Administration, in addition to freight, is not
entitled to levy new charge with effect from 1-6-61 either
as siding charges or as shunting charges or as placement
charges or as removal charges or under the pretext of any
other charge and the levy of the said new charge from the
plaintiff with effect from 1-6-61 is wrong all the arbitrary,
unauthorised and unreasonable and excessive and the
plaintiff is entitled to the refund of this new charge paid by
him to the defendant-Western Railway Administration. This
also amounts to double taxation. In para 28 of the plaint,
plaintiff actually refers to the total amount recovered in that
manner. In the relief clause 33 prayer made is to recover
the suit amount which includes the amount it paid by way
of new charges as said earlier, and the notice charges,
and it is in terms stated that it is a claim for refund of
new charger by way of siding charges, shunting charges,
placement charges received by the defendant Western
Railway Administration from the plaintiff.

27. In the instant case, it is not the opponent’s case that
charges in excess of the prescribed charges were recovered
from him and he wants refund of such charges. What he
claims is that the railway administration had collected
such charges illegally, arbitrarily and unreasonably. These
charges referred to as ‘new charges’ were levied by the
railway administration from time to time and such collections
made in the past are challenged on the aforesaid grounds.

In my opinion, they cannot be termed ‘overcharges’, so as
to attract the provisions of Section 78-B [...]”

49. In Birla Cement Works v. G.M. Westerm Railways & Anr. reported
in (1995) 2 SCC 493, this Court held that the excess freight charged
by mistake due to a wrong calculation of distance was an overcharge
and thus, was covered by Section 78B of the 1890 Act (now Section
106 of the Act, 1989). The relevant observations read as under: -
“2. The principal contention raised by the petitioner is that
it had discovered the mistake when the railway authorities
confirmed by their letter dated 12-10-1990 that they had
committed a mistake in charging excess freight on wrong
calculation of distance. The limitation starts running from the
date of discovery of mistake and, therefore, stands excluded,
by operation of Section 17(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, 1963
(Act 21 of 1963) and that Section 78-B has no application
to the facts in this case. In consequence, the High Court
and the Tribunal have committed error of law in rejecting
the claim for refund. We find no force in the contention.
xxx xxx xxx
4. [...] Section 78-B of the Act provides that a person shall
not be entitled to refund of overcharge or excess payment
in respect of animals or goods carried by Railway unless
his claim to the refund has been preferred in writing by him
or on his behalf to the Railway Administration to which the
animals or goods were delivered to be carried by Railway
etc. within six months from the date of the delivery of the
animals or goods for carriage by Railway. The proviso has
no application to the facts of this case. An overcharge
is also a charge which would fall within the meaning of
Section 78-B of the Act. Since the claims were admittedly
made under Section 78-B itself but beyond six months, by
operation of that provision in the section itself, the claim
becomes barred by limitation. Therefore, the Tribunal and
the High Court have rightly concluded that the petitioner
is not entitled to the refund of the amount claimed.”

Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
50. In Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra), the goods were booked to
be carried through a longer-route and the freight was accordingly
charged for the long route. However, the goods instead were
dispatched through the shorter route. The Orissa High Court held
that overcharge is anything charged in excess of what is actually to
be charged for a particular thing. The High Court observed that as
the goods had been booked for the longer route, the freight was also
payable for the longer route. Since, no freight in excess of what was
payable was realized, the High Court held that the claim for refund
of the difference in freight charges was not one of overcharge. The
relevant observations read as under: -
“4. [...] the coal imported at Visakhapatnam Port for carriage
to Rourkela Steel Plant was required to be booked and
carried by the longer route covering 1082 kilometres instead
of by the shorter route of 667 kilometres. According to
the plaintiff, in view of the rationalisation scheme and the
general order, it had no choice but to pay freight for the
longer route, as booking could not be for carriage over
the shorter route.
5. It is the further case of the plaintiff that in or about
April, 1987, an officer came to know that some of the
rakes booked were despatched to Rourkela by the shorter
route (covering a distance of 667 kilometres) though
weight charges were recovered for carriage by the longer
rationalised route (covering a distance of 1082 kilometres).
On further enquiry made at different junctions, it was
gathered that during the period 15-4-1986 to 28-11-1986
and 5-1-1987 to 28-2-1987, a large quantity of imported
coal booked from Visakhapatnam to Bondamunda had
in fact been carried, not by the rationalised route but by
the shorter route. On coming to know about the aforesaid
fact, alleges the plaintiff, it lodged a demand for refund of
the differential amount of Rs. 1,32,87,749/-, but the same
was turned down. [...]

13-A. The word “overcharge” has not been defined in the
Act. Therefore, the common parlance meaning has to be
taken to explain its meaning. In common parlance, the
1096 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
simple meaning of “overcharge” is anything charged in
excess of what is actually to be charged for a particular
thing. Taking this to be the meaning of “overcharge”, it has
to be seen as to whether the claim of the respondent is
or is not for refund of overcharge. Admittedly, the goods
were booked for being carried over the rationalised route
which covers a distance of 1082 kilometres. It is neither
the respondent’s case nor the appellants’ case that what
was charged towards freight was in excess of what was
payable for the distance of 1082 kilometres. In other words,
the respondent was not “overcharged” because no freight
in excess of what was payable for 1082 kilometres was
realised.
14. To appreciate the meaning of “overcharge”, as
illustration from the facts of the present case would, I feel,
be appropriate. Say for example, ‘A’ had booked the coal
for being carried by the shorter route covering a distance
of 667 kilometres but freight was charged from him for the
longer route covering a distance of 1082 kilometres. Here,
since the coal was booked to be carried by the shorter
route, freight ought to have been determined accordingly.
So, any amount recovered from ‘A’ towards freight in
excess of what was legally payable for the distance of
667 kilometres would be an ‘overcharge’ because what
was recovered from him was over and above what was
actually payable for the distance of 667 kilometres over
which goods were booked. Alternatively, if ‘A’ had booked
the goods over the longer route covering a distance of 1082
kilometres and freight was charged for such distance but
carriage was over the shorter route covering distance of
667 kilometres, in such a situation, if ‘A’, on coming to know
that though he had booked the goods to be carried over
the longer route and had paid the freight accordingly yet
as the goods were carried over the shorter route, claims
for a refund, this claim would not be one for “overcharge”
for the simple reason that he had booked the goods by
a particular route and paid the freight that was payable
for that distance. The claim of the respondent in the
present case is of a like nature. Thus, under no stretch
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1097
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
of imagination can it be said that its claim is for refund of
over-charge. The contention of the learned counsel for
the appellants that the claim made by the respondent for
refund of overcharge, therefore, must fail.”

51. In Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Union of India reported
in AIR 2001 Bom 310, the freight was initially being charged on an
inflated distance rate as fixed by the Central Government. Later the
freight was fixed to be charged on the actual distance, however, the
railway continued charging freight as per the old inflated distance
under a mistaken belief that the same was still applicable. The High
Court prima-facie was of the view that the refund of the difference in
freight was an overcharge and thus barred by Section 106(3) of the
Act, 1989. However, the High Court relegated the petitioners therein
to avail the statutory remedy and dismissed the writ petition leaving
all issues open for determination by the Railway Claims Tribunal.
The relevant observations read as under: -
“2. The facts of the case, which are not in dispute, are:—
Petitioners, Rajasthan State Electricity Board, are an
autonomous public body, wholly owned and controlled by
the State Government of Rajasthan. For the generation
of electricity at their Thermal Power Station at Kota
(Rajasthan), coal is transported from collieries situate in
areas covered by the Eastern and South Eastern Railways
to a station called Gurla, situate in Kota Division of the
Western Railway. Between the 4th March, 1992 and 31st
December, 1992, the Petitioners booked 248 rakes for
carrying coal to Gurla. The routes on which these wagons
were transported include a section of Central Railway, viz.,
Katni-Singrauli. In exercise of powers under section 71
of the Railways Act, 1989, the Central Government had
imposed, for movement of coal wagons over this section
“inflated distance rate” of freight. Consequently, for the coal
wagons moved by the petitioners, the freight included the
inflated distance rate for this particular section of Katni-
Singrauli. For the wagons booked by the petitioners, freight
was paid at Gurla Station of Kota Division of the Western
Railway. The Railway Authorities charged the petitioners
1098 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
freight on the basis of inflated distance rate over Katni-
Singrauli section upto 31st December, 1992, but from the
1st January, 1993, the Railways started charging freight
on the basis of actual distance for Katni-Singrauli section,
instead of inflated distance rate, and the petitioners paid
the charges on that basis.
xxx xxx xxx
9. It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that sub-
section (3) of section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 is
not attracted in the facts of this case-inasmuch as there
was no dispute regarding the over-charge. The instant
case was a case of collection of inflated distance charge
without authority of law. It was submitted that there is a
distinction between over-charge and a wrong charge. It
was, therefore, submitted that the Petitioners were not
required to give notice as contemplated by sub-section
(3) of section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989, since the
claim was not a claim for refund of an overcharge in
respect of goods carried by railway. On the other hand,
the respondents contend that this clearly a case where
the Petitioners claim refund of an over-charge in respect
of goods carried by railway, and, therefore, admittedly, the
Petitioners claim that they have been charged more than
what they should have been charged because the circular
under which inflated distance charge was levied had been
withdrawn, and was not operative during the period in
question. Despite this, the Petitioners were compelled to
pay the inflated distance charge.
10. In our view, the submission urged on behalf of
the respondents must prevail, and the same is clearly
supported by the principles laid down by the Apex Court
in Birla Cement Works v. G.M., Western Railways, (1995)
2 SCC 493 : AIR 1995 SC 1111. The petitioner therein
manufacturer of Cement at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, had
transported cement to various destinations through railway
carriages. Prior to 3rd May, 1989, the Petitioner got the
cement transported through meter gauge from the railway
siding at Chanderia. After conversion into broad gauge the
railway siding was at Difthkola Chittor Broad Gauge Rail
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1099
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Link. Consequently, 34 kilometres’ distance was added
to levy freight charges. Thereafter, between May-June,
1989 and March, 1990 the Petitioner had booked various
consignments of cement and transported them to diverse
destinations and paid the freight charges. Later, on January
21, 1991, the Petitioner had sent a notice to the Western
Railway under section 78-B of the Indian Railway Act,
1890, claiming refund of different amounts. Since it was
rejected, the Petitioner laid a claim under section 16 of the
Act before the Railway Claims Tribunal, which dismissed
the petition holding the same to be barred under section
78-B of the Indian Railway Act, 1890.
xxx xxx xxx
16. [...] Having regard to the scheme of the Act, we
are satisfied that it provides a complete mechanism for
correcting any error, whether of fact or law, and that
not only a remedy is provided by way of claim before a
Tribunal, but also a further appeal to this Court, which is
a Civil Court. It would, therefore, not be appropriate for
this Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, to give relief,
which authority, in law, has been vested in the Claims
Tribunal under section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal
Act, 1987.
xxx xxx xxx
18. We, therefore, find no merit in this Writ Petition, and
the same is accordingly dismissed, and Rule discharged,
but without prejudice to the right of the petitioners to seek
remedy before the appropriate forum, if so advised.”

52. The aforesaid decision of the Bombay High Court came to be
challenged before this Court. A 2-Judge Bench of this Court in
Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Union of India reported in
(2008) 5 SCC 632, set-aside the High Court’s order and held the
appellant therein to be entitled to refund of the freight charges. The
relevant observations read as under: -
“4. In the present case between 4-3-1992 and 31-12-1992
the appellant had booked rakes for carrying coal to Gurla.
1100 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
A sum of Rs. 3,56,69,671 which had been collected from
the appellant over a period of time by mistake. That the
mistake has been committed is admitted by the respondent
herein and it is has duly been noted by the High Court.
However, the High Court, in our view, erroneously rejected
the claim on the ground of availability of alternative remedy.
On the aforesaid premises the High Court dismissed the
wirt petition with the direction to the appellant to approach
the Railway Claims Tribunal for alternative remedy provided
under Section 13 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987
(hereinafter “the Act”).
5. We are clearly of the view that as the respondent Union
of India has clearly admitted the liability, the High Court
ought not to have relegated the appellant to its alternative
remedy and should not have dismissed the writ petition
on that count. There is no disputed question of fact in this
case. As already noted, in the present case the respondent
had admitted its liability and, therefore, the question raised
before the High Court being an admitted fact the High
Court ought not to have directed the appellant to resort
to its alternative remedy under the Act.
6. In the aforesaid premises, we set aside the impugned
order of the High Court. This appeal is allowed. No costs.
The respondents are directed to pay the admitted liability
along with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. with effect from
6-1-1993 till payment is made within three months from
today.”
(Emphasis supplied)
53. In Union of India & Ors. v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. & Anr.
reported in (2004) 3 SCC 458, the prescribed rate that was being
charged as per law by the railways had been declared to be illegal.
This Court held that any claim of refund of such charge which
is illegal cannot be said to be an overcharge and thus does not
attract Section 78B of the Act, 1890. This Court explained that an
overcharge is something in excess of what is due according to law,
an overcharge must be of the same genus or class as a charge,
and it does not include a sum that was collected but was not due.
The relevant observations read as under: -
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1101
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
“19. The term overcharge is not defined in the Act. In its
dictionary meaning “overcharge” means “a charge of a sum,
more than is permitted by law” (see: Aiyar, P. Ramanatha:
The Law Lexicon, 1997 Edn., p. 1389). The term came
up for the consideration of the High Court of Gujarat in
Shah Raichand Amulakh v. Union of India. Chief Justice
P.N. Bhagwati (as His Lordship then was) interpreted the
term by holding that “overcharge” is not a term of art. It is
an ordinary word of the English language which according
to its plain natural sense means any charge in excess of
that prescribed or permitted by law. To be an overcharge,
a sum of money must partake of the same character as
the charge itself or must be of the same genus or class
as a charge; it cannot be any other kind of money such
as money recovered where nothing is due. Overcharge is
simply a charge in excess of that which is due according
to law.
20. In the case at hand, the freight rates notified by the
Railway Administration in exercise of its statutory power
to do so, so long as they were not declared illegal and
unreasonable by the Tribunal under Section 41 of the Act,
were legal and anyone carrying the goods by rail was
liable to pay the freight in accordance with those rates.
The freight paid by the respondents was as per the rates
notified. Thus the present one is not a case of overcharge
at all. It is a case of illegal recovery of freight on account
of being unreasonable and in violation of Section 28 of the
Act, consequent upon such determination by the Tribunal
and the decision of the Tribunal having been upheld by this
Court. A case of “illegal charge” is distinguishable from the
case of “overcharge” and does not attract the applicability
of Section 78-B of the Railways Act.”
(Emphasis supplied)
54. In J.K. Lakshmi Cement Ltd. v. General Manager & Anr. reported in
(2014) SCC OnLine Raj 2340, the Rajasthan High Court held that the
freight charged mistakenly on a wrong calculation of distance between
the two stations was an overcharge and not an illegal charge. The
High Court observed that an overcharge is an excess sum having
1102 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the same character as the basic charge which otherwise is payable,
and thus, any other kind of levy unrelated to the basic charge would
not be an overcharge. Since the excess freight that was charged
due to mistake on part of the railway booking staff related to ‘freight
charges’ which otherwise was payable, the same was held to be an
overcharge. The relevant observations read as under: -
“[...] The facts of the case are that the appellant-Company
dispatched 5 racks of 4100 M.T. levy cement from its Banas
siding to be carried and delivered at Thiyat Hamira Railway
Station. The distance between two stations is stated to be
only 511 Kms, and the Railways alleged to had charged
freight for distance of 946 Kms. Calculating the distance via
Rewari. It was stated that because of this mistake in the
calculation of the distance from the appellant-Company’s
Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira Railway Station, railway
freight was charged in excess @ Rs. 21.44 per qtl. Instead
of the applicable rate of Rs. 13.11 per qtl. and paid under
mistake. Consequently Rs. 3,69,775/- was overpaid. This
excess realisation was according to the appellant-Company
on the face of it arbitrary, unauthorized and illegal and thus
refundable by the Railways with interest.
xxx xxx xxx
[...] Further, a bare look at the judgement of the Hon’ble
Gujarat High Court in Mansukhlal Jethalal (Supra) as also
the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in West
Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (Supra) makes it clear that an
overcharge of freight would mean “a charge of sum more
than permitted in law”. Overcharge of a sum of money for
a purpose partakes the same character as the underlying
charge and belongs to the same genus or class the basic
charge. Any other kind of levy of money unrelated to the
basic charge would, as held by the Gujarat High Court
and the Hon’ble Supreme Court, indeed would not take
the character of an overcharge. In the Gujarat High Court
case the overcharge related to a charge relating to the use
of sidings of the Railways and it did not entail an excess
charge on the freight as in the instant case. So to in the
case before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In my considered
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1103
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
opinion, from the very enunciation of law by the Hon’ble
Gujarat High Court in Mansukhlal Jethalal (Supra) and
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in West Coast Paper Mills
Ltd. (Supra) it is evident that the charge levied over the
appellant-Company was qua the freight and movement
of goods and nothing more excessive though it is alleged
to be. It did not have a character different from the basic
change. In fact the appellant-Company itself averred of
realisation of an excess freight and specifically in para
6 of the plaint had itself averred that due to mistake in
calculating of distance excess freight was realised at the
rate of Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl.. Further
in the notice under Section 78B of the Act of 1890 R/w
Section 80 CPC issued by the appellant-Company prior
to the filing of the suit for recovery of money before the
District Judge, Sirohi, it was submitted that due to mistake
on the part of the booking staff of the Railways incorrect
distance was computed from Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira
railway station against the correct chargeable distance of
511 KMs and the distance was worked out to 946 KMs.
which was the chargeable via Rewari. In para 4 of the suit
it was stated that on the part of the Railway enhanced rate
(emphasis mine) @ Rs.21.44 per qtl. was charged. In my
considered opinion as also held by the learned Tribunal,
the case set up by the appellant-Company makes it
evidently clear that the refund was sought of the excess
freight realized allegedly illegally and unauthorizedly. The
excess freight without doubt related to freight otherwise
payable for the movement / transportation of goods by
the Railways and therefore was obviously an overcharge.
Consequently, Section 78B of the Act of 1890 attracted
to the claim petition filed. Admittedly notice with regard
to the freight paid between 07.12.1985 and 11.02.1986
was issued on 17.02.1988 quite clearly beyond the period
of six months as statutorily mandated. The Tribunal was
right in so holding.”
(Emphasis supplied)
55. Furthermore, the contention that retainment of excess freight by the
railway due to the claim applications being time-barred would amount
1104 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to unjust enrichment of the Railway came to be negatived by the
Rajasthan High Court in J.K. Lakshmi Cement (supra). The High
Court observed that equity cannot defeat the statutory provision and
thus, if any excess freight realized by the railway is held to be an
unjust enrichment it would result in the statutory time-period under
Section 78B of the Act, 1989 being rendered otiose and redundant.
The relevant observations read as under: -
“Mr. S.R. Joshi has finally submitted that in the event this
Court were to uphold the impugned order dated 15.05.1990,
passed by the Tribunal, it would entail unjust enrichment
of the Railway as admittedly the distance over which its
goods were transported was 511 KMs and not 946 KMs
(between Banas siding and Thiyat Hamira railway station)
and further that rate charged was Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead
of Rs.13.11 per qtl. Limitation under Section 78B of the
Act of 1989 has been statutorily provided for. A misplaced
argument of unjust enrichment cannot be misapplied,
removed from the context it has been developed by
courts of equity and turned on its head and be agitated to
circumvent the provisions of statutory limitation and for the
matter, the Limitation Act. Were it to be so, the provisions
of the law limitation under the Act of 1963 or otherwise
would be rendered otiose and redundant. Equity to defeat
pubic policy encapsulated in the statutes of limitation
cannot be visualised.”
(Emphasis supplied)
56. In another decision of this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation
Ltd. v. Union of India, reported in (2018) 17 SCC 729, the freight
had been paid as per the notified chargeable distance. Subsequently
when a computerized system for generating railway receipts was
introduced, the chargeable distance was reduced and re-notified.
This Court relying upon West Coast Paper Mills (supra) held that
since the freight had been paid as per the notified rate which was
later found to be incorrect, the case would be of an illegal charge
and not an overcharge. The relevant observations reads as under: -
“2. The core facts that will be required to be noticed are
as follows: the appellant, a public sector organisation, had
dispatched various petroleum products through Railway
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1105
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Tank Wagons of the respondent from Asaudah Railway
Station, District Rohtak, Haryana to Partapur, District
Meerut, Uttar Pradesh and to some other destinations
located in different parts of the country. The freight was
paid by the appellant as per the notified distance i.e.,
125 Km, so notified by the Chief Goods Supervisor, the
competent authority at the relevant point of time. The
dispatch of the petroleum products continued for a long
period between the year 2008 and 2011 and the freight
charges were paid according to the distance between
the destinations as notified by the competent authority of
the respondent. When the manual system of generating
railway receipts was discontinued and the respondent
had installed computerised railway freight charges system
called Terminal mechanism System (TMS) at Asaudha
Railway Station, the distance between Asaudah Railway
Station, District Rohtak, Haryana and Partapur District
Meerut (Uttar Pradesh was notified as 100 km instead of
125 km. This was on 27-2-2011.
xxx xxx xxx
8. Birla Cement Works was a case where the petitioner
therein (i.e., Birla Cement Works) came to know of the
alleged excess amount of freight on wrong calculation of
distance through a letter dated 12-10-1990 issued by the
Railway Authorities. This primary fact is conspicuously
absent in the present case. In the present case what was
paid was as per the fixed rate on the basis of notified
distance which subsequently was corrected by another
Notification upon introduction of the Terminal Mechanism
System (TMS) at Asaudah Railway Station, District Rohtak,
Haryana.
9. On the other hand, in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd., this
Court in para 20 of the said Report took the view as the
freight paid was as per the rates notified the case would
not be one of overcharge at all/ If that is the view taken by
this Court on an interpretation of the pari materia provision
in erstwhile Act i.e., the Railway Act, 1890 (i.e., Section
78-B) we do not see why, in the facts of the present case
1106 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which are largely identical, we should be taking any other
view in the matter.”
(Emphasis supplied)
57. In Union of India v. Mineral Enterprises reported in (2019) SCC
OnLine Kar 1971, the Karnataka High Court was dealing with a
matter where the actual distance between the two stations was less
than what was charged by the railways. The Karnataka High Court in
the said case held that the excess freight collected by the railways
on a chargeable distance more than the prescribed distance was
an overcharge within the meaning of Section 106 of the Act, 1989.
The relevant observations read as under: -
“3. [...] The facts briefly stated are that the respondent
M/s Mineral Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., was transporting the
minerals through the appellant railways from Ammasandra
to Panamburu as per the rates fixed for transportation of
the consignment. The distance from Ammasandra Railway
Station to Panamburu was calculated as 365 Kms. and
freight was charged as per the rate fixed by the railways. The
freight charges were dependent on the distance between
the place of loading and unloading of consignment. Later,
on enquiry it was learnt that the actual distance between
Ammasandra Railway Station to Panamburu post is only
359 Kms. and not 365 Kms. as charged by the appellant
railways. Therefore, the respondent Company made
correspondence with the railways through letters dated
3.10.2006, 5.5.2007 and 20.07.2007 requesting to take
corrective action. [...]
xxx xxx xxx
14. It is and admitted fact that the respondent Company
had transported the irone ore fines / minerals through the
railways for the period from 25.05.2006 to 04.01.2007 at
the rates fixed by the railway. The main controversy was
in respect of refund of excess freight charges said to
have been collected by the railways than the prescribed
rates fixed on the basis of distance. In that connection the
respondent Company had sought for clarification about
the actual distance for which the appellant railways gave
the reply. As could be seen from the records the actual
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1107
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
distance between Ammasandra to Panamburu is 358 kms.,
whereas the railways had calculated the distance as 365
kms., but they have collected the rates applicable for the
distance above 360 Kms. It is an admitted fact that after
clarification regarding actual distance, the railways had
settled some of the claims of the respondent Company
regarding excess charges which were within the limitation
period. Some of the claims to an extent of Rs.8,85,000/-
were rejected on the reason that they were barred by
limitation. Under these circumstances, it is necessary
to ascertain whether the repudiation of claims regarding
Rs.8,85,000/- was justified.

23. The learned counsel for the appellant railways has
relied on a decision in the case of Birla Cement Works
vs. G M, Western Railways and another reported in
(1995) 2 SCC 493, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court
has held under:
“Railways - Railways Act, 1890 - S.78.B - Railway Claims

4. Section 78-B of the Act provides that a person shall
not be entitled to refund of overcharge or excess payment
in respect of animal or goods carried by Railway unless
his claim to the refund has been preferred in writing
by him or on his behalf to the Railway Administration
to which the animals or goods were delivered to be
carried by Railway etc. within six months from the date
of the delivery of the animals or goods for carriage by
railway the proviso has no application to the fact of this
case. An overcharge is also a charge which would fall
within the meaning of Section 78-B of the Act. Since the
claims were admittedly made under Section 78-B itself
1108 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
but beyond six months, by operation of that provision in
the section itself, the claim becomes barred by limitation.
Therefore, the Tribunal and the High Court have rightly
concluded that the petitioner is not entitled to the refund
of the amount claimed. “
24. In the aforesaid case the principal contention raised
by the petitioner was that the claimant had discovered
the mistake when the railway authorities confirmed by
their letter that they had committed a mistake in charging
excess freight on wrong calculation of distance. As such,
the limitation starts running from the date of discovery of
mistake and therefore stands excluded by the operation of
Section 17(i)(c) of Limitation Act and that Section 78(B) has
no application to the facts in this case. But it was held that
Section 17(i)(c) of Limitation Act, 1963, would apply only
to a suit instituted or an application made in that behalf
in the civil suit but whereas the Tribunal is the creature
of statute, therefore it is not a civil court nor the limitation
act has application, even though it may be held that the
petitioner discovered the mistake committed in paying the
over charges, the limitation is not saved by operation of
Section 17(i) (c) of the Limitation Act.
25. The facts of the case on hand are exactly similar to that
of the facts involved in the aforesaid decision. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the said situation has held that the claims
made under Section 78(B) are barred by limitation. As such,
they cannot be entertained. The aforesaid decision was not
at all referred or considered in the decisions relied on by the
counsel for the claimant - respondent. The doctrine of binding
precedent is of utmost importance in the administration of
judicial system. It brings certainty and consistency in judicial
decisions. The judicial consistency promotes confidence in
the system. The ratio laid down in the aforesaid decision
((1995) 2 SCC 493) is aptly applicable to the facts of this
case. As such, the claims which are barred by limitation in
view of Section 106 of the Railways Act (78(B) of the Old
Act) cannot be entertained.”

Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
58. In yet another decision of the Orissa High Court in M/s National
Aluminium Co. Ltd. v. Union of India FAO No. 306 of 2022, the
goods were booked to be carried by a longer-route and freight was
accordingly charged for the long route. However, the goods instead
were dispatched by the shorter route. The High Court placing reliance
on Steel Authority of India Ltd. (supra) which involved similar facts,
held that since what was charged was prescribed by law, the refund
was not for an overcharge, and Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989
would not be attracted. The relevant observations read as under: -
“8. Mrs. Rath contends that the Tribunal has misconceived
the claim for refund of additional freight charges received
by the railways with the term ‘overcharges’ and in this
regard she relies on a decision of this Court reported in
AIR 1997 Orissa 77 (Union of India and others vrs. Steel
Authority of India Limited).
9. The above referred case is involving similar issues
where SAIL filed a suit before the Sub-Judge, Rourkela
praying for refund of excessive charges received by the
railways under the rationalization scheme relating to the
old Act, i.e. Indian Railways Act, 1890. Section 78-B of the
old Act is same to the present Section 106 in the Railways
Act, 1989. This Court while deciding with the issue that,
whether the claim for refund of overcharge is maintainable
for want of notice under Section 78-B, have held that the
claim is not one for ‘overcharge’ for the simple reason that
the goods were booked by a particular route and paid the
freight that was payable for that distance. [...]
10. In view of the above, no second opinion can be there
to treat the claim of refund of additional freight charges
beyond ‘overcharges’ and no prior notice under Section 106
of the Railways Act is required to be sent. Undisputedly,
no such notice has been sent by NALCO as per the
submissions made by Mrs. Rath in course of hearing and
the admitted fact remains that several intimations seeking
refund of such amount from the railways have been sent by
NALCO in those letters annexed to the claim application,
as seen from the copy of the claim application produced in
course of hearing. So, no further discussions on the facts
1110 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of the present case is needed here on the requirement of
notice under Section 106.”
(Emphasis supplied)
59. What can be discerned from the above is that this Court as-well
as various High Courts have consistently held that the rigours of
Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 will only be applicable where the
claim is for a refund of an ‘overcharge’. Where the claim for refund
is for anything but an ‘overcharge’, Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989
will not apply, and no notice of claim is required.
b. Concept of an ‘Overcharge’ and an ‘Illegal Charge’
60. As to what would be an ‘overcharge’, this Court and the various High
Courts have consistently held that an ‘overcharge’ is any sum charged
in excess or more than what was payable as per law. Whereas an
illegal charge is any sum which is impermissible in law.
61. Since the underlying difference in the dictionary meaning of both the
expressions; “overcharge” and “illegal charge” is that of the prefix
“over” and “illegal”, used in conjunction with the word “charge”, it would
be apposite to first understand the meaning of the term “charge”.
(i) “CHARGE”
P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol I, 6th Edn.,
2019 at pg. 886) defines “Charge” as: -
“it is the price required or demanded for
services rendered.”
(Emphasis supplied)
L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd
Edn., 2005 at pg. 460) defines “charge” as under: -
“any sum fixed by law for services of public
officers or for use of a privilege under control
of government”
(Emphasis supplied)
Henry Campbell Black in ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn.,
1968 at pg. 295) defines “Chargeable” as: -
“something capable or liable to be charged”.
(Emphasis supplied)
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1111
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
(ii) “OVER”
The term “over” as a prefix has been defined by L.P. Singh
and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005
at pg. 996) as under: -
“excessive or beyond a an agreed or desirable
limit”.
(Emphasis supplied)
P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol III, 6th Edn.,
2019 at pg. 3990) states that “Over” as a prefix denotes
something: -
“something excessive or excessively”
(Emphasis supplied)
Henry Campbell Black on ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn.,
1968 at pg. 1256) defines it as something: -
“more than or in excess of”
(Emphasis supplied)
(iii) “ILLEGAL”
Whereas the term “illegal” is defined by Henry Campbell
Black in ‘Black’s Law Dictionary’ (4th Edn., 1968 at pg.
882) as something: -
“not authorized by law or contrary to law or
unlawful” or “something which lacks authority
of or support from law”
(Emphasis supplied)
P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ‘The Law Lexicon’ (Vol II, 6th Edn.,
2019 at pg. 2605) defines it as: -
“something that is against the law” or “something
which is contrary to or forbidden by law”
(Emphasis supplied)
L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd
Edn., 2005 at pg. 749) defines it as: -
“something which is prohibited by law”
(Emphasis supplied)
1112 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
62. Thus, in its plain meaning, the use of words “capable” and “imposed
by law” shows that the term “charge” means something which in
the eyes of law is permissible and payable, and therefore the term
“overcharge” which is a conjunction of “over” and “charge” would
mean something more than or beyond what is payable in the eyes
of law. Same way, an “illegal charge” would mean a charge which
is contrary to the law or lacks the authority of law or simplicter is
unlawful.
63. L.P. Singh and P.K. Majumdar’s ‘Judicial Dictionary’ (2nd Edn., 2005
at pg. 888) defines ‘over-charge’ in the context of Section 106 of
the Act, 1989 as follows: –
“The expressions “charge” and “over charge” are properly
employed only with reference to actual quantum of
liability, and they cannot be applied to relate to rates of
charges. There will be an over charge if Railway applies
higher rate than appropriate and there can also be an
over charge where even at a rate which itself is not
open to objection, there is yet an excessive liability
foisted by the railway. It is not possible to restrict the
expression over charge only to former kind of cases
where the railway applies a higher rate than that which
the law allows.”
(Emphasis supplied)
64. Thus, in the context of Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Act, 1989,
an “overcharge” would be any sum which has been paid in excess
or over and above or more than what was payable by law / required
by law. It pertains to only the actual quantum of liability. Furthermore,
merely, because an incorrect or rather higher slab-rate has been
applied, will not make it an illegal charge, as long as the charge
was not itself open to objection i.e., not incorrect.
65. It is pertinent to note, that the term “payable by law” should not
be conflated with the term “permissible by law”, this is because
although something maybe paid in excess than what was required
by law, yet the same would by no means automatically become an
“overcharge”. This is further fortified from the fact that, “charge” as
above-stated is defined to mean something which is either required
OR demanded to be paid.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1113
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
66. For illustration; say ‘A’ booked certain goods to be carried by railway,
and the railway charged ‘A’ loading charges for the goods, even-
though, there was no loading of goods involved. Here, although the
law allows railway to levy loading charges i.e., the loading charges
are permissible by law, and even-though the sum paid by ‘A’ towards
loading charges can be said to be in excess of what was required
(i.e., in excess of Nil loading charges as no loading was involved),
this would not be an “overcharge” but would be an “illegal charge”.
67. We say so because, the very basic charge or in other words the genus
or basis of the charge i.e., the loading charge in itself was not required
to be paid. Thus, when the very basis or genus of the charge was not
payable as per law then any sum which is collected in respect of the
same will not be an overcharge but would be an illegal charge. Since
the very class of the charge was not required to be payable by law.
68. Conversely, say for example, ‘A’ again booked certain goods to
be carried by railway, and the railway charged ‘A’ loading charges
for the goods, and this time loading of goods was involved in the
consignment, but the railway mistakenly charged ‘A’ Rs. 100/- more
towards the loading charges than what was required by the rate
applicable. Here the basis or genus of this excess charge of Rs.
100/- i.e., the loading charges itself was payable by law. Any sum
charged in excess of the loading charges as required by law would
be an ‘overcharge’.
69. For another illustration, say ‘A’ booked the carriage of iron ore by the
railway, however, instead of being charged for the rate applicable
for iron, the railway by mistake charged ‘A’ for steel. Now the rate
which is applicable for steel is permissible by law, but here since iron
was being carried, the rate applicable for steel though permissible
by law is not payable by law, as the consignment was not for steel.
Thus, any sum paid although is in excess of what was required,
and the charge towards which it was paid was also permissible by
law, the sum cannot be said to have been paid in excess of what
was payable by law.
70. Thus, for an excess sum to be an “overcharge” the sum paid must
partake the same character as the basic charge, or must belong
to the same genus of charge which was payable or required to be
paid by law. Whereas, for an illegal charge, the sum must not have
been payable by law.
1114 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
71. Another very fine but pertinent distinction between an ‘overcharge’
and an ‘illegal charge’ is that, an ‘overcharge’ is generally inter-se the
specific parties involved and in its peculiar facts. Whereas an ‘illegal
charge’ is illegal for everyone irrespective of the parties or facts.
72. For illustration, say ‘A’ booked 10 boxes to be carried by railway,
however, he was erroneously charged for 12 boxes. Here the
excess amount that has been charged for 12 boxes instead of 10
is an overcharge qua these specific facts for ‘A’ alone. If ‘B’ books
12 boxes to be carried by railway, the said charge which was an
overcharge qua ‘A’ will not be an overcharge qua ‘B’. For that
matter even if ‘A’ in a different consignment books 12 boxes and is
charged for 12 boxes, it will not constitute an overcharge. This will
not be an illegal charge because, it is not illegal for Railway to levy
charge for 12 boxes ipso-facto (whenever a consignment is booked
for 12 boxes, the Railway can levy that charge), but rather it is
erroneous to levy charge for 12 boxes when in fact only 10 boxes
were carried. Here whether the sum charged is an overcharge or
not is largely dependent upon the peculiar facts, more particularly
the number of boxes being booked for carriage. Thus, it can be
safely said, that in case of an overcharge, the issue lies in the
“charging” whereas in case of an illegal charge, the issue lies in
the “charge” itself.
73. Conversely for example, say for a particular route, the chargeable
distance as per the law was 100 km, but the railways incorrectly
showed the chargeable distance as 120 km in its local rate list. Now
‘A’ books a consignment of iron ore and ‘B’ books a consignment
of steel, over the same 120 km distance. Irrespective of the type
of goods or the quantity of goods being carried or by whom the
consignment has been booked, any amount charged in respect of
this incorrect chargeable distance of 120 km is an illegal charge.
Here the sum charged as an illegal charge is not dependent upon
either the peculiar facts or the parties thereof, the charge is illegal
solely because the very charge itself i.e., the chargeable distance
of 120 km was in contravention of the law.
74. An Overcharge is effectively concerned with the error in the quantum
of what was or should be payable, whereas an illegal charge is solely
concerned with whether a particular thing was payable by the law /
in conformity with the law or not.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1115
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
75. Another aspect that distinguishes the two is that, an ‘overcharge’ often
stems due to a clerical mistake or mis-interpretation or misapplication
of law in a particular case, whereas an ‘illegal charge’ stems from
a patent error or inherent error in the charge i.e., in contravention
of the law and principles of fair play. In other words, in overcharge,
the mistake is in the levying of the charge, whereas in illegal charge
the error lies in the very substance of the charge itself which is in
contravention of the law, even though the charge per-se is permissible
by law.
76. In West Coast Paper Mills (supra), the concerned railway zone
therein was charging freight at a flat rate without giving any
telescopic benefits to the consignees, which the other railway zones
were providing. This denial of telescopic benefit was found to be
unreasonable, arbitrary and against fair-play. Thus, the same was
held to be illegal by this Court even-though the said charge was
payable as per the notified rate.
77. To illustrate, say the chargeable distance as measured by the
concerned Zonal Railway Authority for a particular route is 100 km.
However, the Station Master whilst making the local distance table
records the said distance as 110 km due to a clerical mistake. Thus,
because of an error in indicating the actual chargeable distance
in the table, the freight for the said route becomes chargeable for
110 km. Although the mistake here is a clerical one, yet because
of such mistake, an inherent error has crept into the local distance
table. Thus, the notified rate would be an illegal charge and not an
overcharge. This is because the error here lies in the very substance
or genesis of the charge that was notified i.e., the charge which is
sanctioned and permitted to be levied by the law, but in contravention
of the law i.e., in contravention of the Zonal Authority’s calculation.
78. We are conscious of the fact that this Court in Rajasthan State
Electricity Board (supra) had directed the refund of excess freight
charged by misapplication of the law despite the claim being time-
barred under Section 106(3), however, a closer reading would reveal
that the refund had been directed in view of the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case. Even otherwise, the court in the said
decision whilst directing the refund completely missed to advert to
either the bar under Section 106(3) or whether the excess freight
would be an ‘overcharge’. Nevertheless, the distinction between an
1116 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
‘overcharge’ and an ‘illegal charge’ has been acknowledged by this
Court in its subsequent decisions in West Coast Paper Mills (supra)
and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (supra), thus, we need not
dwell any further on the decision of Rajasthan State Electricity
Board (supra).
79. Further, a sum paid in excess of what was required to be payable
as per law, must assume the character of an ‘overcharge’ on the
date when the payment was made or when the charge was levied.
To explain this in detail we may refer to the decision of the Calcutta
High Court in Suresh Kumar v. Board of Trustees for the Port of
Calcutta reported in (1988) SCC OnLine Cal 420.
79.1 In the said decision, the issue pertained to the provision of
Section 55 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 (for short, the
“Ports Act”), which is analogous to Section 106(3) of the Act,
1989, inasmuch as both the provisions provide that for a claim
of refund of an ‘overcharge’ a notice of claim must be made
within 6-months from the date of payment.
79.2 The facts of Suresh Kumar (supra) were as follows: there was
a delay in custom clearance, because of which the goods had
to be warehoused at the port. Due to this, the goods incurred
heavy demurrage charges. The petitioner therein requested
the custom authorities that since the delay was to no fault of
its own, he may be issued an exemption certificate for the said
demurrages. During this period, since the goods continued
incurring demurrage charges, the petitioner therein paid the
same under protest. Subsequent to the payment of the said
charges, he was issued exemption certificates, whereby a
portion of the demurrage charges stood abated. Accordingly, a
claim for refund was made, however the same inter-alia came
to be rejected in view of being time-barred as per Section 55
of the Ports Act.
79.3 The Calcutta High Court observed that, although this was
in essence a refund for an overcharge, as by virtue of the
exemption certificates, a sum excess than what was required
by law had been paid, yet, it would not be hit by Section 55 of
the Ports Act, as the excess sum only assumed a character
of an overcharge, subsequent to the date of payment, when
the exemption certificates were issued. The High Court held
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1117
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
that the time-period under Section 55 of the Ports Act would
only apply to a case where payment and overcharging would
synchronize i.e., on the facts and circumstances as prevailing
on the date of payment, the sum should be an overcharge. The
relevant observations read as under: -
“5. Because of the inordinate delay [in] the release
of the said goods after completing all Customs
formalities, the said goods suffered heavy demurrage
charges. Accordingly the petitioner represented before
the Customs authorities for allowing warehousing of
the said goods, pending completion of the Customs
formalities [...]
7. Due to the aforesaid delay in allowing clearance of
the said goods by the Customs authorities, the said
goods incurred heavy demurrage due to no fault of
the petitioner. In the circumstances, the petitioner
prayed before the Customs authorities for issuance of
necessary wharf rent exemption certificate in order to
enable the petitioner to clear the consignment without
payment of demurrages from the Port authorities.
After several reminders on or about March 25, 1985
the Customs authorities handed over a wharf rent
exemption certificate dated March 23, 1985 to the
petitioner covering part of the period of detention,
that is from November 28, 1984 to March 1, 1985 in
respect of consignment arrived per Vessel “Batara
Dua” and from January 22, 1985 to March 1, 1985
in respect of the consignments arrived per vessel
“Vishwa Yash”.
8. Thereupon the petitioner again requested the
Customs authorities for issuance of wharf rent
exemption certificate for the entire period of detention,
that is, upto March 25, 1985. Meanwhile, however,
as the goods were continuing to incur demurrage,
the petitioner had no other alternative but to make
payment of the demurrage charges to the Port
authorities under protest and take clearance of the
said goods. In respect of the said consignments, the
1118 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
petitioner paid a total sum of Rs. 8,43,995 as purported
demurrage charges for the period November 28, 1984
to March 25, 1985 in respect of vessel “Batara Dua”
and for the period January 15, 1985 to March 25,
1985 in respect of vessel “Vishwa Yash”.
9. Thereafter, on or about February 3, 1986 the
Customs authorities issued another wharf rent
exemption certificate for the uncovered period from
March 2, 1985 to March 25, 1985 in respect of the
said goods.
10. In the premises, by a letter dated 15th February,
1986, the petitioner filed an application before the
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer, Post
and Railway Audit Section, Calcutta Port Trust
enclosing therewith the bills issued by the Port Trust
authorities levying and realising demurrage charges
as also the said wharf rent exemption certificates. By
the said application the petitioner claimed refund for
the sum of Rs. 8,43,995 paid by him under protest
as aforesaid as purported demurrage/wharf rent
charges. The petitioner drew the attention of the said
Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer to the
fact that in view of the said Wharf Rent Exemption
Certificate the petitioner was not/could not be made,
liable for payment of the said demurrage/wharf rent
charges.
11. In or about March 1986 the petitioner’s
representative received a purported communication
dated 22nd February, 1986 issued by the Financial
Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer whereby the
petitioner was informed that “no refund was due” to
the petitioner as all claims were “time-barred as per
Section 55 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963”.
14. It is also contended that the petitioner could have
and should have submitted the refund claim within
the time limit prescribed under Section 55 of the
Major Port Trust Act, 1963 but the claim for refund
was submitted by the petitioner on 26th March, 1985
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1119
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
and 27th March, 1985. The claim for refund of the
petitioner is statutorily time-barred.
15. The contention is that while taking delivery of the
said consignments the petitioner paid the port charges,
that is to say, wharf rent and demurrage and did not
produce any certificate from the Customs authority
covering the period between the 2nd March, 1985
and 25th March, 1985 to the concerned shed of the
Calcutta Port in order to enable himself to obtain the
concession on any rent charges in accordance with
the scale of rates. The port rent and demurrage were
paid in full and the wharfage exemption certificate
was produced subsequently for refund. The payment
made to the Port Trust while taking delivery of the
cargo from its custody was an overcharge for which
a claim should have been preferred within the time
prescribed in Section 55 of the said Act.
16. The first question which calls for determination
is whether Section 55 of the Major Port Trusts Act,
1963 has any application on the facts and in the
circumstances of this case. Section 55 provides as
follows:
“No person shall be entitled to a refund of an
overcharge made by a Board unless his claim to the
refund has been preferred in writing by him or on his
behalf to the Board within six months from the date
of payment duly supported by all relevant documents.
Provided that a Board may of its own motion remit
overcharges made in its bills at any time.”
17. It is contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that in the instant case there is or can
be no “overcharges” being made by the Port Trust
Authorities. In the absence of Wharf Rent Exemption
Certificate, the Port Trust Authorities had sought to
realise Wharf Rent payable in respect of the subject
goods. In view of the said Wharf Rent Exemption
Certificate no wharf rent is payable by the petitioner
and/or realisable by Port Trust Authorities from the
1120 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
petitioner. Thus the entire realisation of wharf rent in
respect of the said goods is without authority of law
as the said amount is not payable by the petitioner
at all. Seeking of refund of such money cannot come
within the purview of Section 55 of the said Act.
18. This contention has substance. Section 55 will
only apply to a case where payment and overcharging
would synchronise : In other words, on the facts and
in the cirumstances prevailing at the date of payment,
Board should have overcharged the rent. In this case,
on the date payment was made by the petitioner, the
payment did not and could not assume the character
of overcharging. It only assumed such character when
the second set of exemption certificates had been
issued on 3rd February, 1986.”
(Emphasis supplied)
80. Section 106 of the Act, 1989, sub-section (3) specifically uses the
words “paid” and “date of payment”. This clearly fortifies the above
observations, that for a sum to be an “overcharge” within the meaning
of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, it must be an overcharge on the
date when such sum was paid. If on the date when the payment
was made, the sum in question was not an overcharge, it will not
become an ‘overcharge” due to intervention of subsequent events
at-least in terms of Section 106 of the Act, 1989.
81. Otherwise, the same would lead to a very chilling effect, whereby a
particular sum which at the time of payment was not an overcharge
but due to subsequent events (not attributable to any mistake or lack
of diligence) happens to become an overcharge after the lapse of
the statutory time-period under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 i.e.,
6-months after the date of payment, even then the said sum would
not be refundable because no notice was made within 6-months.
Thus, the claim for refund of an “overcharge” in such case would
become time-barred owing to an impossibility i.e., making the notice
within the time-period which could not have been made, as at the
relevant point of time it was not an overcharge.
82. It is a settled law that in interpreting a statute or a rule, the court must
bear in mind that the legislature does not intend what is unreasonable
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1121
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
or impossible. If a rule leads to an absurdity or manifest injustice from
any adherence to it, the court can step in. A statute or a rule ordinarily
should be most agreeable to convenience, reason and as far as possible
to do justice to all. A law/rule should be beneficial in the sense that it
should suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. In interpreting
a rule, it is legitimate to take into consideration the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of any provision. Gross absurdity must always be
avoided in a statute/rule. The expression reasonable means rational,
according to the dictate of reason and not excessive or immoderate.
83. Thus, keeping in mind the aforesaid view, and the specific language
used in Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 particularly the words “paid”
and “date of payment”, the aspects of “payment” and “overcharging”
must synchronize in order to fall within the rigours of Section 106(3)
of the Act, 1989.
84. This aforesaid aspect may be looked at from one another angle,
by making use of the Hohfeld’s analysis of jural relations. As per
Hohfeld’s scheme of jural relations conferring of a right on one entity
must entail vesting of a corresponding duty in another. Under Section
106(3) of the Act, 1989, the right of consignee to seek a refund of
an overcharge arises only when there is a corresponding duty on
the railway administration to grant such refund i.e., when the notice
of claim is made to it within the statutory period. To seek a refund,
certain condition precedents need to be satisfied by the consignee
before the right can be said to accrue, namely: -
a) An overcharge has been paid by the consignor to the
Railway administration
b) A notice has been served by the consignor to the Railway
administration to which overcharge has been paid
c) The consignor has served the said notice within six months
from the date of such payment or the date of delivery of
such goods at the destination station, whichever is later.
84.1 Thus, once the aforesaid conditions are satisfied, the consignee’s
“right to get a refund” can be said to have as its jural correlative
the “duty to grant refund” of the Railway administration.
85. Now the consignee’s duty to make the notice of claim for refund
will only arise if the sum was an overcharge within the statutory
time-period, if it is not, then it could not be said that there was any
1122 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
duty to make the notice of claim. Similarly, if the right of consignee
to claim a refund for an overcharge, accrues when the sum was
an overcharge on the date of payment, the corresponding duty of
consignor to refund it will also arise when the sum was an overcharge.
86. Thus, if on the date of payment, the sum was not an overcharge,
neither is the right to claim refund emanating in terms of Section
106(3) nor is the corresponding duty i.e., neither the right nor the
duty could be said to have arisen on the date of payment. Both the
right to claim refund and the corresponding duty to refund must arise
in synergy in terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 (emphasis). It
would be too much to say that, although no overcharge was made
in terms of Section 106(3), yet when the sum actually became an
overcharge, the duty to seek refund will only be in terms of Section
106(3) of the Act, 1989.
87. For illustration, say, goods were booked and freight was charged
at the rate of Rs. 100 per km, and accordingly freight was paid.
Subsequently, 7-months later the Railways decides as a matter of
policy to reduce it to Rs 50 per km with retrospective effect. Now
though the reduction is taking place retrospectively, but intimated
7-months after when the payment was made, and further even-
though, this is an overcharge (because Rs. 50 has been paid in
excess of what was payable), it would not mean that in order to
seek refund of the excess sum, the notice ought to have been
made within 6-months as per Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, when
the payment was made. Such a case, although of an overcharge,
cannot be said to be one of “overcharge” within the meaning of
Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, thus no notice of claim would be
required in such cases.
88. Another peculiar aspect which must be borne in mind, is that the
subsequent event which makes a particular charge an overcharge,
must take place subsequent to the date of payment. For illustration,
say freight on goods carried was charged by mistake at Rs. 100
instead of Rs. 50. Now this aspect comes to the knowledge of the
parties 6-months after the date of payment. This would not mean that
at the time when freight was being paid it was not an overcharge,
as the excess sum was realized due to a mistake committed on the
date of payment irrespective of subsequent knowledge. It cannot be
said that due to a bona-fide mistake neither party was under the
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1123
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
impression that this is an overcharge. This is reinforced from the
decision of this Court in Birla Cement Works (supra). Thus, whilst
deciding the applicability of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 what
has to be seen is whether the very sum that was levied was an
overcharge or not on the date of payment. Mere lack of knowledge
will not postpone the accrual of cause of action to apply under Section
106(3) of the Act, 1989.
89. This distinction drawn between a claim for refund of an ‘overcharge’
and an ‘illegal charge’ is not imaginary or superfluous, but is well-
founded from the landmark decision of a 9-Judge Bench of this
Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India reported
in (1997) 5 SCC 536, wherein this Court observed that a claim of
refund for any excise or custom duty levied will broadly fall into three
categories, and the relevant observations read as under: -
“290. Broadly, the basis for the various refund claims can
be classified into 3 groups or categories: -
(I) The levy is unconstitutional — outside the provisions
of the Act or not contemplated by the Act.
(II) The levy is based on misconstruction or wrong or
erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions of
the Act, Rules or Notifications; or by failure to follow
the vital or fundamental provisions of the Act or by
acting in violation of the fundamental principles of
judicial procedure.
(III) Mistake of law — the levy or imposition was
unconstitutional or illegal or not exigible in law (without
jurisdiction) and, so found in a proceeding initiated
not by the particular assessee, but in a proceeding
initiated by some other assessee either by the High
Court or the Supreme Court, and as soon as the
assessee came to know of the judgment (within the
period of limitation), he initiated action for refund of
the tax paid by him, due to mistake of law.”
(Emphasis supplied)
90. We see no reason as to why the above-mentioned distinction and
categories should only be restricted to claims for refund pertaining
to excise and custom levied and not extend to refund of charges
1124 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
levied by the Railway as-well. Thus, applying the aforesaid dictum,
the three-categories can broadly be stated to be as follows: -
(i) Category 1 – “Illegal Charge” that is a levy which is outside
or beyond the law. It is a charge which though may be notified
in law as a lawful charge but at its core is stricto-sensu in
contravention of the law, as explained by us in the preceding
paragraphs of this judgement.
(ii) Category 2 – “Overcharge” that is a levy based on
misconstruction or misinterpretation or failure to follow the
fundamental provisions / principle. It is a charge that is in excess
of beyond what was required by the law i.e., by the notified or
applicable charge, as illustrated in the preceding paragraphs
of our discussion.
(iii) Category 3 – “Nullified Charge” a levy which has been
declared or struck-down as unconstitutional or illegal by a court
on principles of arbitrariness, unreasonableness or fair-play. This
too would be in the nature of an “Illegal Charge” enunciated in
Category 1 with the only difference being that, the courts found
the law to be untenable in the eyes of law even though it may
not be in contravention of the statutory provisions. Such as
the charge levied by the arbitrary denial of telescopic benefits
which was held to be illegal in West Coast Paper Mills (supra).
91. Another reason, as to why this distinction assumes importance is
in view of the intention behind the rigours of Section 106(3) of the
Act, 1989. The purpose behind incorporating the stricter and shorter
time-period envisaged under Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 for
refund of an overcharge is in view of its nature.
92. An ‘overcharge’ as discussed by us above emanates due to a
clerical or arithmetical mistake or misapplication of the law or
charge prescribed or notified by the law, qua the peculiar facts of an
individual case. Such mistakes are easily discoverable by exercising
due-diligence; thus, a 6-month time period is stipulated to ensure
that claimants are vigilant and prompt in bringing such errors to the
notice of the railway. Due to the fact specific nature of such claims by
way of errors at the very grass-root level, timely enquiries by railway
to ascertain the mistake becomes a necessity. Thus, the intention
of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 is to ensure that when the claim
is made, a timely enquiry into such factual errors is possible AND
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1125
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
to bring quietus to stale and false claims of refunds made belatedly
due to the laches & lack of vigilance on part of the claimant.
93. The true purport of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 is by no stretch to
render even those claims of refunds as time-barred which despite the
best of efforts and diligence could not have been discovered by the
claimants on their own accord. ‘Illegal Charges’ are by their nature
prescribed, sanctioned and notified by law as a lawful levy even-
though they may be inherently wrong or in contravention of the law.
Thus, despite the exercise of a reasonable degree of diligence, there
could be no real reason to doubt their legality. A consignee cannot
be reasonably expected to be capable of discovering such patent
or perverse error in the very genesis of the charge. It is something
which only the authority that calculates, determines and notifies the
levy of the charge could be said to know or at the very least ought
to have known. Thus, Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989 cannot be said
to encompass even “Illegal Charges” which are beyond the intention
and object of the said provision, and the applicability of the prescribed
time-limit must be confined only to claims for an ‘overcharge’.
94. Therefore, a distinction has been envisaged between an ‘overcharge’
and an ‘illegal charge’, where the former relates to any excess sum
paid due to a mistake which was capable of being discovered by
exercise of proper vigilance and thus, ought to have been claimed
within a period of 6-months.
95. Lastly, we must also caution the courts and the railway claims tribunal
of one another aspect, which is that where the court or tribunal
whilst examining a claim for refund finds that a particular charge for
which refund is sought is not an overcharge, they must not jump to
the conclusion that the said charge then is an illegal charge. The
purpose of the above discussion was only to bring clarity over what
would be an ‘overcharge’ for the purposes of Section 106 sub-section
(3) of the Act, 1989.
96. There may be situations, where a charge for which refund is sought
may no be an overcharge or even an illegal charge and rather would
be a lawful charge perfectly valid in the eyes of law, or a charge
though valid but in the extant of equity may be refundable, the same
has to be determined upon appraisal of the entire facts of the case.
The courts and tribunal must be mindful of the fact that, the question
as to what is the nature of a particular charge, be it overcharge or
1126 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
illegal charge or valid charge etc. is for ultimately determining whether
it is liable for refund or not, without jumping to any conclusion.
97. This is evinced from the decisions of Steel Authority of India Ltd.
(supra) and National Aluminium Co. Ltd. (supra), where as per the
mandate of the Central Government’s policy, the goods in question
were required to be carried only over the longer route. Accordingly,
the goods were booked and freight was also realized for the longer
route, but the railways dispatched the goods by the shorter-route
due to logistical issues. Even though the High Court found nothing
wrong with either the policy or the freight charge realized, and held
both to be lawful, yet it directed refund in view of principles of equity
by taking recourse to Section 72 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
98. Thus, from the above discussion, it is abundantly clear that there
exists a very fine & clear distinction between an overcharge and
an illegal charge, and that Section 106 sub-section (3) of the Act,
1989 only applies when the claim is for a refund of an overcharge,
for all other charges, be it illegal or not, the said provision will have
no application whatsoever.
iii. Whether the present case is one of ‘Overcharge’ or ‘Illegal
Charge’?
a. Applicability of Section 106(3) of the Railways Act, 1989.
99. Now coming to the facts of the present case at hand, it is the case
of the respondent company herein that at the time of booking the
consignments, from Baad to Hisar via Palwal, the notified chargeable
distance for calculating freight as per the Local Distance Table was
444 km, and accordingly the respondent company paid the same
from time to time.
100. However, subsequently, the appellant railways vide its letter dated
05.07.2005 changed the chargeable distance to 334 km in the
revised Local Distance Table and the said revised table was to apply
prospectively. It is undisputed that, at the time when the respondent
company had booked its consignment, the notified chargeable
distance was 444 km for Baad to Hisar, and any consignment booked
for the said route was to be charged as per the said rate.
101. The respondent company has contended that a change in the notified
chargeable distance due to a change in policy was held to be illegal
by this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (supra). The High
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1127
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Court too whilst passing the impugned order has placed reliance on
the said decision and held that the present case is squarely covered
by the ratio of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (supra).
102. However, we are not in agreement with the same. In Hindustan
Petroleum Corp Ltd. (supra), the notified chargeable distance was
125 km, subsequently by the introduction of the Terminal Mechanism
System (TMS) which was a computerized railway receipt system, the
notified chargeable distance was reduced to 100 km. A close reading
of the said decision would reveal that the change in the notified
distance was attributable to a computerized receipt system, which
had no bearing on the actual calculation of distance, in other words
a receipt system had nothing to do with determining a chargeable
distance. Thus, when the chargeable distance subsequent to the
introduction of the said receipt system got altered and came out to
be 100 km, this Court had no hesitation to hold that the initial notified
distance of 125 km was illegal, and only upon the introduction of the
TMS system, the said glaring patent error came into light.
103. However, in the instant case, the change in the policy is in respect to
the change in the methodology for calculation of chargeable distance,
which has a direct bearing on the chargeable distance payable as
per law. Thus, a mere change in policy which results in the change
of a charge payable as per law, will not render the original charge
illegal, regard must be had to the nature of the policy and its effect.
Thus, on this score, the High Court committed an error.
104. The respondent company has also undisputedly paid the freight
charges as per the notified chargeable distance, and nothing more
has been charged than what was at the time of booking of the
consignment required to be charged as per the law prevailing i.e.,
as per the old local distance table.
105. The case of the respondent company is not that it has paid anything
in excess of what was at the time of booking of the consignment
required by law, rather, the respondent’s case is that the charge
which was required to be paid by the law as prevailing at the time
of booking of the consignment was wrong. In other words, the
respondent’s case is that the very chargeable distance of 444 km as
per the old local distance table was wrong, and not that the distance
for which the respondent has been charged is incorrect in terms of
the chargeable distance that was notified at that time.
1128 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
106. We are seisin of the fact that in J.K. Lakshmi (supra) and Mineral
Enterprises (supra) the freight charged due to an incorrect chargeable
distance was held to be an overcharge.
106.1 However, a close reading of J.K. Lakshmi (supra) would reveal,
that it was not a case where the notified chargeable distance
was incorrect, but rather was a mistake of miscalculation on
the part of the booking staff i.e., it was a clerical mistake and
not a mistake attributable to a charge permitted and notified
under the law. It does not appear that the said case was
dealing with a situation where the notified or prescribed rate /
chargeable distance was wrong, in fact the distance averred to
be wrong is not a chargeable distance that has been notified
in any manner. The relevant observations read as under: -
“[...] The distance between two stations is stated
to be only 511 KMs and the Railways alleged
to had charged freight for distance of 946 KMs
calculating the distance via Rewari. It was stated
that because of this mistake in the calculation
of the distance from the appellant-Company’s
Banas siding to Thiyat Hamira Railway Station,
railway freight was charged in excess @
Rs.21.44 per qtl. instead of the applicable rate
of Rs.13.11 per qtl. and paid under mistake.
Consequently Rs.3,69,775/- was overpaid.
This excess realisation was according to the
appellant-Company on the face of it arbitrary,
unauthorized and illegal and thus refundable by
the Railways with interest.
xxx xxx xxx
He submitted that the factum of the realisation of
excess charge in an arbitrary and unauthorized
manner by the Railway came to the notice of the
appellant-Company only on or about 30.12.1987
when in the course of Government of India audit
of the accounts of the appellant-Company with
regard to supply of rakes of levy cement from
its factory, it transpired that the excess freight
had been unauthorizedly realized by the Railway
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1129
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
in miscalculating the distance between Banas
siding of the appellant-Company and place of
delivery at Thiyat Hamira Railway station by
wrongly measuring the distance as 946 KMs
as against the actual distance of 511 KMs
between the two stations. Counsel submitted
that no sooner the letter dated 30.12.1987 was
received by the appellant-Company requisite
notice were issued to the respondent-Railway
on 17.02.1988.[...]
xxx xxx xxx
[...] In fact the appellant-company itself averred
of realisation of an excess freight and specifically
in para 6 of the plaint had itself averred that due
to “mistake” in calculating of distance, excess
freight was realised at the rate of Rs.21.44 per
qtl. instead of Rs.13.11 per qtl.. Further in the
notice under Section 78B of the Act of 1890
R/w Section 80 CPC issued by the appellant-
Company prior to the filing of the suit for
recovery of money before the District Judge,
Sirohi, it was submitted that due to mistake on
the part of the booking staff of the Railways
incorrect distance was computed from Banas
siding to Thiyat Hamira railway station against
the correct chargeable distance of 511 KMs
and the distance was worked out to 946 KMs.
which was the chargeable via Rewari. In para
4 of the suit it was stated that on the part of
the Railway enhanced rate (emphasis mine) @
Rs.21.44 per qtl. was charged. In my considered
opinion as also held by the learned Tribunal, the
case set up by the appellant-Company makes
it evidently clear that the refund was sought
of the excess freight realizedallegedly illegally
and unauthorizedly. The excess freight without
doubt related to freight otherwise payable for
the movement / transportation of goods by
the Railways and therefore was obviously an
1130 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
overcharge. Consequently, Section 78B of the
Act of 1890 attracted to the claim petition filed.
Admittedly notice with regard to the freight
paid between 07.12.1985 and 11.02.1986 was
issued on 17.02.1988 quite clearly beyond the
period of six months as statutorily mandated.
The Tribunal was right in so holding.”
(Emphasis supplied)
106.2 Similarly in Mineral Enterprises (supra), the wrong chargeable
distance was in respect to the railway receipts which were
issued that showed 365 km instead of 359 km. It was not a
case of the notified rates being wrong i.e., the charge that
has been made payable under law. This is further evinced by
the fact that the High Court itself observed that the excess
freight was charged than the “prescribed distance”. Thus, it
appears that the mistake related to one in the “calculation of
the distance” at the time of booking and doesn’t appear to be
a mistake in the “prescribed distance”. Similarly, even in the
said decision, it is nowhere mentioned that, 365 km was a
“notified chargeable distance”, thus, even this decision does
not come in aid of the appellants herein.
“14. It is an admitted fact that the respondent
Company had transported the iron ore fines/
minerals through the railways for the period
from 25.05.2006 to 04.01.2007 at the rates fixed
by the railways. The main controversy was in
respect of refund of excess freight charges said
to have been collected by the railways than the
prescribed rates fixed on the basis of distance.
In that connection the respondent Company
had sought for clarification about the actual
distance for which the appellant railways gave
the reply. As could be seen from the records
the actual distance between Ammasandra to
Panamburu is 358 kms., whereas the railways
had calculated the distance as 365 kms., but
they have collected the rates applicable for the
distance above 360 Kms. It is an admitted fact
that after clarification regarding actual distance,
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1131
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
the railways had settled some of the claims of the
respondent Company regarding excess charges
which were within the limitation period. Some of
the claims to an extent of Rs.8,85,000/- were
rejected on the reason that they were barred
by limitation. Under these circumstances, it is
necessary to ascertain whether the repudiation
of claims regarding Rs.8,85,000/- was justified.
xxx xxx xxx
24. In the aforesaid case the principal contention
raised by the petitioner was that the claimant
had discovered the mistake when the railway
authorities confirmed by their letter that they had
committed a mistake in charging excess freight
on wrong calculation of distance. [...]”
(Emphasis supplied)
106.3 We do not propose to dwell any further on the decisions of J.K.
Lakshmi (supra) and Mineral Enterprises (supra), and leave it
at rest with just one observation that, as long as there is no error
or patent illegality in the very genesis or core of a charge that has
been notified i.e., the charge that has been made permissible or
applicable by sanction of a law, it will not be an illegal charge.
107. In view of the above, since admittedly, what was charged from
the respondent was as per the chargeable distance notified and
required to be payable by law at that time with nothing in excess,
and since the respondent has challenged the very basis or genus
of the charge i.e., primary challenge is to the chargeable distance
of 444 km in itself and not the incidental quantum of freight levied
on the distance of 444 km, and because the same was admittedly
charged as per the prevailing law and not due to any misapplication
or mistake i.e., as per the old local distance table, this clearly is not
a case of overcharge and would not fall within the four corners of
Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989.
b. Whether the chargeable distance of 444 km was correct
or not?
108. The respondent company herein has challenged the very validity or
correctness of the notified chargeable distance of 444 km which was
1132 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
payable as per the old local distance table. At this stage, it would
be apposite to understand on what basis, the respondent company
has challenged the said chargeable distance of 444 km.
109. The respondent company has contended that, initially the chargeable
distance for the route from Refinery Baad to Hisar was 444 km as
provided in the old local distance table. Subsequently, the appellant
vide its letter dated 05.07.2005 changed and reduced the chargeable
distance to 334 km. The respondent enquired and found out that,
there was neither any change in the actual route nor any change
in the physical track length between the Refinery Baad and Hisar
stations.
110. On such basis, the validity of the old chargeable distance of 444 km
has come under cloud, and the respondent company has questioned
how the chargeable distance came to be reduced by a difference
of 110 km without there being any change in the actual distance in
the route from Refinery Baad to Hisar.
111. The appellant railways, submitted that pursuant to the Ministry
of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004, a new methodology of
‘Rationalization and Rounding-off” was adopted by the railways for
calculating the chargeable distance between any two pair of stations.
As per the new methodology, the chargeable distance was now to
be calculated on the basis of the actual engineering distance of the
various stations reckoned upto two decimal points. For determining
the chargeable distance, the actual entering distance (upto two
decimal) of each station in the route is first added up, and then the
aggregate is rounded-off to the next kilometre only once at the end.
112. Furthermore, the new methodology had been adopted in order to
bring uniformity in the procedure for determining chargeable distance
throughout the railway, and the policy itself contemplated that the
change in methodology would likely result in variation from the
existing freights and fares being levied under the old methodology.
113. The appellants have contended that owing to this change in policy
and methodology, the earlier chargeable distance of 444 km came
to be reduced to 334 km. The appellants have further submitted that
the aforesaid letter dated 07.04.2004, specifically stipulates that the
said change would only apply prospectively and that any variation
from the old fares and freights will not be entitled to any refund.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1133
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
114. We have gone through the aforesaid letter. Since the question before
this Court pertains to the validity or correctness of the old chargeable
distance of 444 km as per the old methodology and not one of refund
of past freight charges solely on basis of a subsequent change in
methodology. Thus, the prospective application of the change in
methodology as per the letter dated 07.04.2004 has no bearing
whatsoever, with the question that is before this Court.
115. The appellant railways has contended that the old chargeable
distance of 444 km was valid and correct as per the old methodology
and distance table that was prevailing at that time, and thus, the
respondent company is not entitled to a refund.
116. Before, we proceed to determine the validity of the old chargeable
distance of 444 km, we must try to understand the stance of the
appellant railway in the present litigation, as discernible from their
pleadings, which has left us quite perplexed. The argument of the
appellant railways is twofold: -
(i) First, that the respondent company is not entitled to any refund
whatsoever, since the change in chargeable distance was due
to a change in the methodology, and that the old chargeable
distance was correct as per the old methodology and distance
table.
(ii) Alternatively, it has been contended that, in the event this Court
finds that the respondent is entitled to refund of the difference
in chargeable distance, the same would at best be a case of
‘overcharge’ and the claim could be said to be time-barred in
terms of Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989.
117. Thus, the primary thrust of the appellant’s contention is that this
is neither a case of overcharge nor an illegal charge, as the old
chargeable distance was valid as per the old methodology and
distance table, thus, the respondent company is not entitled to any
refund whatsoever.
118. However, interestingly, despite maintaining the aforesaid stance
that no case is made out for a refund, the appellant railway itself
during the pendency of the matter before the Railway Claims
Tribunal, Ghaziabad granted refund to the respondent company
in approx. 45 claims that were made within the 6-month statutory
time period
1134 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
119. Prima-facie since the refund was not made by any adjudicatory
authority it would have no bearing in the case of the appellant
before this Court, however we should be mindful, that the appellant
remarkably in its entire pleadings has nowhere explained why the
refund was granted in the first place or even remotely indicated that
the same had been granted due to a mistake.
120. The appellant despite contending that the old chargeable distance
of 444 km was correct and valid as per the old methodology and the
old distance table, the appellant has neither provided the complete
old distance table nor explained what was the old methodology being
used that resulted in a 110 km difference in the chargeable distance.
121. As discussed by us above in this judgement, when a charge is alleged
to be illegal, it would be too much to expect a consignee such as the
respondent herein to prove that a particular charge is illegal or not.
It is only the authority who formulated and prescribed a particular
charge that may be capable of establishing that a particular charge
is valid or not. The threshold of the ‘burden of proof’ if we may use
that term that is required to be discharged, when challenging a
particular charge as an “illegal charge”, is only on the preponderance
of probabilities, upon which the onus will shift on the authorities to
establish how the particular charge is valid.
122. In the instant case, the respondent whilst challenging the validity
of the chargeable distance of 444 km has submitted as follows: -
a. That, the notification / communication whereby the chargeable
distance was reduced from 444 km to 334 km had no bearing
with the change in policy in the methodology for calculating
the chargeable distance as alleged by the appellants herein.
b. Further, the said communication shows that the chargeable
distance was a matter of “correction” made after “critically
reviewing” the old distance tables, and thus, indicating that the
chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal.
c. The respondent, upon enquiry from the concerned railway office
came to learn, that there been no change in either the physical
tracks or the route to warrant a change in the chargeable
distance from 444 km to 334 km.
123. The respondents have more than sufficiently showcased, how and why
the chargeable distance of 444 km appears to be illegal. However,
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1135
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
in response to the same the appellants herein have stated that, the
chargeable distance of 444 km was correct as per the old distance
table and the old methodology as prevailing, but have not been in a
position to explain nor provide any documents to substantiate how
the same was correct. Thus, except for a bald assertion, no other
foundation has been laid for offering such a claim.
124. Despite the aforesaid, we ourselves have undertaken the pains of
examining the validity of the chargeable distance of 444 km. A close
reading of the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 regarding
the new rationalization methodology and a careful analysis of a small
portion of the old distance table that was prevailing vis-à-vis the
current distance table would give some insight and clarity over the
old methodology that was being used to calculate the chargeable
distance. For the purposes of explanation, the said distance tables
are reproduced below: -
Figure 1: Distance Table as per the Old Methodology
In the above distance table: -
● “. .” indicates the Originating Point, i.e., the station of origin from
which the goods are booked / loaded for carriage.
● Chargeable Distance from one station to another is calculated
by the aggregate of the distance of all stations between the
Originating Station and the Destination Station.
1136 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
● For example, the chargeable distance from Baad to Mathura
is calculated by the actual engineering distance between the
two pair of stations.
● “(A)” to “(B)” indicates the actual engineering distance between
Baad and Mathura.
● “(C)” indicates the chargeable distance which is calculated by
adding the distance between (A) & (B) and thereafter rounding
off the aggregate to the next kilometre.
Figure 2: Distance Table as per the New Methodology
xxx --- xxx --- xxx
125. The striking difference between the Old Distance Table in Figure
1 and the New Distance Table in Figure 2 is that under the old
methodology the distance between each station is being rounded-off,
whereas in the new methodology the distance between each station
is not rounded-off, and rather is indicated up-to two decimal points.
Thus, in the Old Distance Table the chargeable distance between
(A) Baad and (B) Mathura comes out to be (C) 11 km whereas
under the New Distance Table distance between (A1) Baad and (B1)
Mathura distance is indicated as 10.22 and upon rounding it off, the
chargeable distance would come out to (C1) 11Km.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1137
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
126. Thus, prima-facie it appears that under both; the Old Distance Table
and the New Distance Table, the actual engineering difference was
being taken into consideration, and the only difference between the
two methodologies lies in the rounding-off. Under the old methodology,
the actual engineering distance for every station was being rounded-off
to the next kilometre, whereas under the new methodology this was
done away, and only the cumulative distance is being rounded-off
only once at the very end to the next kilometre.
127. Thus, when calculating the chargeable distance for a specific route
under the old methodology, each station that exists in-between the
route would at best add 1 km each. Thus, the extent to which the
cumulative chargeable distance for a route would get inflated will
roughly correspond to the number of stations it has in its route, with
each intervening station increasing the chargeable distance by a
maximum of 1 km.
128. This is further evinced from the fact that, the Ministry of Railway’s letter
dated 07.04.2004 by which the new methodology was introduced,
itself in the subject uses the words “Rounding off of Chargeable
Distance: Rationalization of fares and freight”. This indicates that
both methodologies utilized actual engineering distance with the only
underlying difference between both of the them being in respect of
rounding-off and nothing more.
129. Furthermore, in the letter dated 05.07.2005 issued by the Chief
Goods Supervisor (CGS), Northern Railway, whereby the chargeable
distance from Refinery Baad to Hisar was reduced from 444 km to
334 km, it is nowhere mentioned that the same was done pursuant
to the new methodology of “Rationalization of Rounding Off” or by
virtue of the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated 07.04.2004 whereby
the new methodology was introduced for the first time.
130. The aforesaid letter dated 05.07.2005 of the CGS only goes so far as
to say that the old distance tables were “critically reviewed” and that
now the chargeable distance should be 334 km. In fact, the aforesaid
letter further instructs CGS Baad that “the other disputed distance
should also be corrected as per the new junction table and the correct
distance should be charged”. The use of the words “disputed” and
“corrected” used in the said letter clearly indicates that the distance of
444 km was incorrect in itself, and that the change in the chargeable
distance had nothing to do with the new methodology of ‘Rounding Off’.
1138 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
131. We are conscious of the fact that in the aforesaid letter dated
05.07.2005, it was indicated that the chargeable distance of 444 km
was being levied as per the old distance table, and that the same
was corrected as per the revised distance table. However, it must
be borne in mind, that merely because the chargeable distance of
444 km was correct as per the old distance table will not ipso-facto
make the chargeable distance of 444 km correct.
132. The correctness of a chargeable distance is dependent upon the
correct application of the methodology prescribed by law and correct
calculation of the same pursuant to the methodology. A distance
table, is a public document, which is available and displayed at each
station, whenever a consignment is to be booked, the chargeable
distance is calculated as per that distance table, had the distance
table been incorrect, the respondent company would have disputed
the same the very first moment when the consignment was probably
being booked.
133. We have no reason to doubt that the chargeable distance as
calculated by the old distance table would have come out to 444
km, had it not, it would have been pointed out by the respondent
company then and there. But merely because the calculation of the
chargeable distance as per the old distance table is correct would
not make the distance table correct as-well.
134. The case of the respondent is that the calculation and application
of the old methodology used for the formation of the distance table
was incorrect, due to which inherent error has crept into the said
distance table, thus it is the distance table which is incorrect and by
its extension the chargeable distance of 444 km which is required
to be payable by the law i.e., the notified distance table.
135. Remarkably, even the Railway Claims Tribunal in its order had
observed that the “actual distance” (emphasis) from Baad to Hissar
was 334 km (sic 333.18 km), and the sole reason why the RCT
rejected the claims of the appellant was on the ground of being
time-barred by Section 106(3) of the Act, 1989, which we have
already stated, is not applicable in the instant case. The relevant
observations read as under: -
“18. [...] In this case, the goods were booked from ’A’ to
‘B’, showing the chargeable distance as 444 Kms. and
payment was given by the applicant company for the same
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1139
Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
distance, but later on, Railways reworked the chargeable
distance as only 333.18 Kms. The consignment in question
was carried through the same route. So, it is clear that
the payment was to be made for 333.18 Kms, whereas it
was made for 444 Kms. So, it is clear that the payment
was to be made for 333.18 Kms., whereas it was made
for 444 Kms.
xxx xxx xxx
22. [...] from the facts of the present case in hand, as in
the present case, the applicant company was well within
the knowledge of the actual distance from Baad to Hisar
was 333.16 Kms, instead of 444 Kms.”
(Emphasis supplied)
136. As afore-stated, since the only tangible difference between the old
methodology and the new methodology is of rounding-off, the effect
of change in methodology upon the chargeable distance would have
at best been limited or confined to a difference of 1 km for each
corresponding intervening station. The route from Refinery Baad
to Hisar has about 48 stations (approx..). It is not the case of the
Appellant that there was any change in either the route by way of
addition of new station or any change in the physical track length
of the said route. Thus, a mere change in methodology would not
have resulted in a difference of 110 km in the chargeable distance.
G. CONCLUSION
137. Thus, we are of the considered opinion, that the chargeable distance
of 444 km was illegal, for the following reasons: -
(i) That, the effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable
distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km,
(ii) That, there had been neither any change in the route by way of
addition of new station nor change in the physical track length
of the said route,
(iii) The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change
in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error,
and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway’s letter dated
07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology.
1140 [2024] 3 S.C.R.

(iv) The factum of the appellants themselves granting refund without
explaining the reason for the same, despite their stance that
the respondent is not entitled to any refund.
(v) The failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable
distance of 444 km was the correct chargeable distance as
per the law.
(vi) Concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and
the High Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance
being 333.18 km.
138. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, we have reached to the conclusion
that the said chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal. We find
no infirmity with the impugned judgement and order passed by the
High Court.
139. In the result, the appeals filed by the appellant railway fails, and are
hereby dismissed.
140. The parties shall bear their own costs.
141. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.

v.
Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
(Civil Appeal No. 4663 of 2009)
20 March 2024
[B. V. Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan,* JJ.]","The appellant had imported second hand steel mill machinery
and parts covered by three transit bonds totalling 595 cases.
The officials of the Preventive Branch of the Commissionerate
searched the industrial premises of the appellant, including
the notified public bonded warehouse and found that only
304 cases were stocked inside the warehouse, whereas
264 cases were found outside the warehouse but within the
industrial/factory premises of the appellant. Remaining 27
cases were neither found inside the warehouse nor outside the
warehouse. The Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise,
inter-alia, confiscated 264 cases of imported goods valued at
Rs.48,79,776.00 seized from within the factory premises of the
appellant but outside the approved warehouse u/s. 111 of the
Customs Act. However, the confiscated goods were permitted
to be redeemed on payment of fine of Rs.2 lakhs. Further,
the Commissioner had confirmed customs duty amounting to
Rs.39,03,821.00 in terms of s.71 r/w. the proviso to s.28A of the
Customs Act. That apart, appellant was directed to pay interest
of Rs.18,88,425.00 on the aforesaid quantum of customs duty
in respect of the 264 cases from the date of warehousing till the
date of detection of the shortage in the warehouse. In appeal,
CESTAT by the impugned order affirmed the aforesaid decision
of the Commissioner.
","Customs Act, 1962 – s.71 r/w. the proviso to s.28A, s.111 – The
allegation of the respondent is that 264 cases were improperly
or unauthorisedly removed from the notified warehouse as
those were found lying outside the notified area but within the
industrial/factory premises of the appellant – That apart, 27
cases were neither found inside the notified warehouse nor

outside the said warehouse but within the factory premises
of the appellant – In such circumstances, the respondent
has justified the order dated 28.04.2005 (passed by the
Commissioner),which was affirmed by the CESTAT vide order
dated 30.04.2009 – Propriety:
Held: The appellant had submitted that soil outside the notified
area that become very sluggish due to heavy rains – As a
result, the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the
notified warehouse and appellant had requested the concerned
Superintendent of Customs and Central Excise to shift the
machineries to under a shed within the factory premises –
The permission was granted – The permission granted by the
Superintendent to the appellant to unload a portion of the cargo
outside the open space which was notified as public bonded
warehouse but within the factory premises of the appellant was
neither cancelled nor revoked by the Superintendent or even by
the Commissioner – Infact, a view can reasonably be taken that
the appellant as the owner of the goods had exercised its right
u/s. 64(d) which was endorsed by the Superintendent – Therefore,
it would not be correct to say that the 264 cases found outside
the notified warehouse but within the factory premises of the
appellant were improperly or unauthorisedly removed from the
notified public bonded warehouse – Also, the period of warehousing
had not expired and continued to remain operational in terms
of the proviso to s.61 of the Customs Act – The decision of the
respondent to invoke s.71 and thereafter levy interest on the
goods covered by the 264 cases u/s. 28AB of the Customs Act
was not justified – Since the imported goods covered by the 264
cases were never warehoused inside the notified public bonded
warehouse but were unloaded outside the notified area but within
the factory premises of the appellant and kept under a shed on
permission granted by the Superintendent which permission
was neither cancelled nor revoked, question of warehousing the
goods covered by the 264 cases within the notified public bonded
warehouse did not arise – However, there is no explanation on
the part of the appellant qua the missing 27 cases – Therefore,
the view taken by the respondent and affirmed by the CESTAT
that those 27 cases were improperly or unauthorisedly removed
from the notified public bonded warehouse is correct and requires
no interference. [Paras 13, 50, 51, 53, 54]

2. This is a statutory appeal under Section 130E of the Customs Act,
1962 (briefly the ‘Customs Act’ hereinafter) against the final order
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 893
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
dated 30.04.2009 passed by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax
Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short ‘CESTAT’ hereinafter) in
Customs Appeal No.441 of 2005 dismissing the appeal filed by
the appellant against the order dated 28.04.2005 passed by the
Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, Indore (for short ‘the
Commissioner’ hereinafter).
2.1. By the aforesaid order dated 28.04.2005, the Commissioner
had confirmed the duty demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 in respect
of 27 cases not found in the warehouse and imposed penalty
of Rs.1 lakh on the appellant under Section 112 of the
Customs Act. That apart, the appellant was directed to pay
interest on the duty confirmed in terms of Section 28AB of the
Customs Act from the date of enforcement of the said section
till the date of actual payment of duty. The Commissioner
had also confiscated 264 cases of imported goods valued at
Rs.48,79,776.00 seized from within the factory premises of the
appellant but outside the approved warehouse under Section
111 of the Customs Act. However, the confiscated goods were
permitted to be redeemed on payment of fine of Rs. 2 lakhs.
Thirty days’ time was granted to the appellant to exercise the
option for redeeming the goods. Further, the Commissioner
had confirmed customs duty amounting to Rs.39,03,821.00
in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28A
of the Customs Act. The appellant was also required to pay
interest amounting to Rs.18,88,425.00 on the customs duty
confirmed on the 264 packages from the date of warehousing
till the date of detection of the shortage in the warehouse; in
addition, appellant was also required to pay interest on the
duty confirmed in terms of Section 28AB of the Customs Act
from the date of enforcement of the said section till the date
of actual payment of duty confirmed on the 264 cases.
3. Appellant before us is M/s Bhanu Iron and Steel Company Limited,
Plot No. 801, Sector III, Industrial Estate, Pithampur, District Dhar
in the State of Madhya Pradesh (‘BISCO’ for short).
4. This appeal has a chequered history. Before finally landing in this
Court, the appellant had gone through several rounds of appeal and
remand. For a proper perspective, it would be apposite to briefly
narrate the factual trajectory of the case.
894 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
5. Appellant had imported second hand steel mill machinery and parts
thereof under Project Import Facility covered by Chapter Heading
No.98.01 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975.
6. A warehouse within the precincts of the industrial/factory premises
of the appellant was notified as a public bonded warehouse on
management basis with M/s Central Warehousing Corporation as
warehouse keeper by the then Collector of Customs and Central
Excise, Indore vide the notification dated 03.05.1989 for storage of
the imported second hand steel mill machinery and parts thereof
without payment of customs duty. According to the respondent, the
appellant had imported in all 595 cases of machinery parts which were
required to be warehoused in the notified public bonded warehouse.
The breakup of the 595 cases of the machinery parts as provided
by the respondent is as under:
Sl. Transit Bond No. & Date No. of cases actually
No. received in the customs
bonded warehouse.
1. T-1592 dated 31.05.89 172
2. T-7012 dated 04.12.89 146
3. T-2014 dated 30.05.90 277
Total 595
7. Acting on the basis of information received that the appellant had
misused the warehousing facility, officials of the respondent had
searched the industrial premises of the appellant including the
notified public bonded warehouse on 07.08.1992. In the course of the
search, the stock lying within the notified public bonded warehouse
were verified. On such verification, only 304 cases were found lying
inside the warehouse; 264 cases were found outside the warehouse
but within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant; remaining
27 cases were not found either inside the warehouse or outside the
warehouse within the industrial/factory premises.
8. As no documents showing clearance of the goods contained in the
264 cases from within the warehouse but lying outside the warehouse
on payment of duty and interest as required under Section 71 of
the Customs Act could be produced, the said goods were seized in
terms of Section 110 of the Customs Act. The value of the goods
seized was estimated at Rs.48,79,776.00.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 895
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
9. In his statement recorded under Section 108 of the Customs Act on
07.08.1992, Sh. Yashwant Singh Bisht, Project Officer (Commercial) of
the appellant stated that the 264 cases of imported goods were kept
outside the bond under a shed as the trailers transporting the goods
could not enter the notified warehouse in view of the soil becoming
very sluggish on account of heavy rains and also because of paucity of
space. The Collector, therefore, opined that the appellant had removed
the 264 cases of warehoused goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00
attracting duty of Rs.39,03,821.00 and interest of Rs.18,88,425.00 in
violation of Section 71 read with Section 111(j) of the Customs Act.
The seized goods were thus held liable for confiscation.
10. It was further alleged that appellant had unauthorisedly cleared 27
cases of the imported goods valued at Rs.4,99,068.00 attracting duty
of Rs.3,99,255.00 with interest of Rs.2,41,326.00 which were liable
to be recovered under Section 71 read with the proviso to Section
28(1) of the Customs Act.
11. That apart, it was alleged that M/s. Central Warehousing Corporation,
Pithampur had abetted the appellant in clearing the warehoused
goods without payment of duty and interest.
12. In the above circumstances, a show cause notice dated 22.01.1993
was issued to the appellant as well as to the warehouse keeper by
the Collector (now the Commissioner) to explain and show cause
as to why:
(i) the seized quantity of 264 cases of goods valued at
Rs.48,79,776.00 and attracting duty of Rs.39,03,821.00
plus Rs.18,88,425.00 due to interest should not be
confiscated in terms of Section 71 read with Section
111(j) of the Customs Act.
(ii) the amount of duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 plus interest
of Rs.2,41,326.00 payable on 27 cases of goods
valued at Rs.4,99,068.00 cleared and utilized by the
appellant, should not be demanded from the appellant
in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to Section
28 (1) of the Customs Act.
(iii) a penalty under Section 112 of the Customs Act
should not be imposed for violation of Section 71
and Section 111(j) of the Customs Act.
896 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
13. Appellant submitted reply dated 02.04.1994. In its reply, appellant
stated that there was heavy rain in the month of August 1989 and
the soil outside the notified warehouse had become very sluggish.
As a result, the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the
notified warehouse. The goods were downloaded in the open outside
the notified warehouse but within the factory premises. To prevent the
goods from getting damaged, appellant had requested the concerned
Superintendent of Customs and Central Excise to shift the machineries
to under a shed within the factory premises under Section 64 of the
Customs Act. Permission was granted by the Superintendent. In terms
of such permission of the Superintendent, who was the proper officer,
appellant had shifted the goods to under the shed to prevent further
damage of the goods. It was contended that the goods were still under
the bonded warehouse and could not be said to have been cleared.
In this connection, reference to and reliance was placed on Section
15 of the Customs Act. This position was clarified by Sh. Yashwant
Singh Bisht in his statement recorded on 07.08.1992. The appellant,
therefore, requested the authority to drop the proceedings.
14. It may be mentioned that the Central Warehousing Corporation (for
short ‘the Corporation’ hereinafter) had also submitted its reply dated
19.12.1993. In the reply it was stated that an open area of 2,000 sq.
meters in the premises of the appellant having fencing and a gate
with locking arrangement was approved by the customs and central
excise authorities as a public bonded warehouse. Appellant vide
letter dated 30.08.1989 sought permission from the Superintendent,
Customs and Central Excise, Range-III, Pithampur for unloading
the cargo covered by Bond No.T-1592 dated 31.05.1989 outside
the said warehouse on account of heavy rains, etc. It was pointed
out that the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the
said warehouse because those got stuck in the soil outside the said
warehouse as the soil had got sluggish due to heavy rains. The
Superintendent gave permission for unloading the cargo outside the
warehouse but within the factory premises on the body of the letter
itself. The machinery parts had to be shifted to a shed outside the
bonded warehouse but within the factory premises to protect those
parts from further rusting and corrosion.
15. Commissioner by his adjudication order dated 28.08.1996 did not
accept the reply of the appellant and confirmed the demand and
interest. It was ordered as under:
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 897
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
(i) demand for duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 plus Rs.2,41,326.00
leviable on 27 cases cleared in a clandestine manner
was confirmed for recovery from the appellant in
terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to Section
28(1) of the Customs Act.
(ii) 264 cases of imported goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00
seized from the premises other than the approved
warehouse were confiscated under Section 111
of the Customs Act but permitted to be redeemed
on payment of fine of Rs.12,00,000.00 (Rs. twelve
lakhs only). Appellant would also suffer duty of
Rs.39,03,821.00 plus interest at the time of their
ultimate clearance.
(iii) penalty of Rs.5,00,000.00 (Rs. five lakhs only) was
imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of the
Customs Act.
(iv) penalty of Rs.25,000.00 (Rs. twenty five thousand
only) was imposed on the Central Warehousing
Corporation under Section 112 of the Customs Act.
16. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Commissioner, appellant
preferred an appeal before the then Central Excise and Gold Appellate
Tribunal (CEGAT). By order dated 18.02.1999, CEGAT disposed
of the appeal by setting aside the order of the Commissioner and
remanding the matter back to the Commissioner for fresh adjudication.
The Commissioner was directed to look into the new facts and
documents brought on record by the appellant and thereafter decide
the case de novo in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
17. Following the remand, a fresh adjudication order was passed by
the Commissioner on 31.12.2002. In this order, the Commissioner
recorded that the warehoused goods were removed to a place outside
the approved warehouse without following the procedure set out
under Sections 67, 68 and 69 of the Customs Act. The Commissioner,
thereafter, reiterated the first adjudication order dated 28.08.1996.
18. Assailing the aforesaid order of the Commissioner dated 31.12.2002,
appellant preferred appeal before the CESTAT. In its order dated
08.10.2003, CESTAT observed that the Commissioner had not
looked into the additional documents which were part of the record.
898 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
CESTAT, therefore, opined that the matter should be remanded
back to the adjudicating authority for fresh adjudication after taking
into consideration the documents produced by the appellant,
including those produced before the CESTAT. Thus, by the order
dated 08.10.2003, CESTAT allowed the appeal of the appellant by
remanding the matter back to the Commissioner for re-adjudication
after affording an opportunity of hearing to the appellant.
19. The matter was taken up by the Commissioner afresh on remand.
By a detailed order dated 28.04.2005, the Commissioner directed
as under:
(i) demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 leviable on the 27 cases
found not warehoused was confirmed for recovery
from the appellant in terms of the conditions of transit
bond.
(ii) appellant should pay interest on the duty confirmed
in terms of Section 28AB of the Customs Act from
the date of enforcement of the said section till the
date of actual payment of duty. The interest amount
was directed to be worked out and communicated to
the appellant by the Assistant Commissioner, Central
Excise Division, Pithampur.
(iii) 264 cases of imported goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00
seized from the premises of the appellant outside the
approved warehouse were confiscated under Section
111 of the Customs Act. As the goods were within the
factory premises but outside the bonded warehouse,
a lenient view was taken; the goods were permitted
to be redeemed on payment of fine of Rs.2,00,000.00
(Rupees two lakhs only). The option for redeeming
the goods was to be exercised by the appellant within
30 days from the date of receipt of the order.
(iv) customs duty amounting to Rs.39,03,821.00 for
recovery from the appellant in terms of Section 71
read with the proviso to Section 28A of the Customs
Act was confirmed.
(v) appellant was required to pay interest amounting to
Rs.18,88,425.00 on the customs duty confirmed on
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 899
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
the 264 packages from the date of warehousing till the
date of detection of the shortage in the warehouse,
i.e. from 04.02.1989 to 07.08.1992, in terms of Section
71 of the Customs Act.
(vi) appellant was also required to pay interest on the
duty confirmed in terms of Section 28AB of the
Customs Act from the date of enforcement of the
said section to till the date of actual payment of duty
confirmed on the 264 packages. The interest amount
was directed to be worked out and communicated to
the appellant by the Assistant Commissioner, Central
Excise Division, Pithampur.
(vii) penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 (Rupees one lakh only)
was imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of
the Customs Act.
20. It was against this order that the related appeal was filed by
the appellant before the CESTAT. By the impugned order dated
30.04.2009, CESTAT dismissed the appeal.
21. Hence the present appeal. This Court by order dated 21.08.2009
had issued notice.
22. Respondent has filed counter affidavit. It is stated that during the
visit of the officials of the Preventive Branch of the Commissionerate
on 07.08.1992, the impugned goods were found outside the notified
warehouse. That apart, there was no explanation for the imported
goods contained in the 27 cases which were neither found within
the bonded warehouse nor outside the bonded warehouse within the
factory premises. In such circumstances, the respondent has justified
the order dated 28.04.2005 which was affirmed by the CESTAT vide
order dated 30.04.2009.
23. It may be mentioned that appellant has brought on record two
additional documents. Appellant had sought for information from
the Central Warehousing Corporation under the Right to Information
Act, 2005 vide letter dated 22.09.2009 regarding payment of custom
establishment charges by the Corporation. Appellant was informed
by the Central Warehousing Corporation vide letter dated 18.12.2009
that the Corporation had deposited a sum of Rs.56,10.294.00 under
the head of ‘Pithampur Warehousing (Bhanu Iron and Steel Company
900 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Limited along with wind up Warehouse) custom establishment
charges’ for the financial year 1992-1993 to 2007-2008.
24. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that CESTAT had failed
to consider the fact that it was on the basis of specific permission
granted to the appellant by the proper officer that the impugned goods
were found outside the warehouse but within the industrial/factory
premises of the appellant. Therefore, in terms Section 64(d) of the
Customs Act respondent could not have treated the said goods as
having been removed from the warehouse. He submits that since the
appellant had not cleared the warehoused goods, Section 64 of the
Customs Act would come into play. Therefore, CESTAT was clearly
in error in upholding the order of the respondent applying Section
15(1)(b) of the Customs Act for determining the rate of duty in respect
of those goods. According to him, in the facts of the present case
the only provision that would be applicable is the residuary provision
i.e., Section 15 (1) (c) of the Customs Act.
24.1 Learned counsel has also placed reliance on the circular
dated 12.07.1989 of the Central Board of Excise and Customs
which was fully applicable to the case of the appellant. Though
this circular was subsequently superseded by circular dated
14.08.1997, it would be the former circular which would be
applicable to the facts of the present case.
24.2 Learned counsel further submits that CESTAT was not justified
for upholding the order of the respondent applying Section 71 of
the Customs Act read with Section 28AB of the said Act while
imposing interest on the confiscated goods. Confiscation itself
was not justified.
24.3 Finally, it is contended that both the respondent as well as
CESTAT had overlooked the fact that the goods in question
were denied to the appellant for a long time. Therefore, a lenient
view ought to have been taken.
25. Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submits
that on the basis of reliable information received about suspected
misuse of the warehousing facility by the appellant, officers of the
Preventive Branch of the Collectorate of Central Excise and Customs,
Indore had searched the premises of the appellant on 07.08.1992
and physically verified the stock. On verification, it was found that
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 901
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
304 cases were stocked inside the warehouse while 264 cases
were found outside the warehouse but within the factory premises.
Remaining 27 cases were found neither inside the warehouse nor
within the factory premises. It was thereafter that action was taken
under the relevant provisions of the Customs Act following which
show cause notice was issued to the appellant.
25.1 Learned counsel has justified the ultimate adjudication order
as well as the impugned order of the CESTAT confirming the
said adjudication order.
25.2 In such circumstances, he submits that there is no merit in the
appeal and, therefore, the same should be dismissed.
26. Submissions made have been duly considered.
27. We may now refer to some of the relevant provisions of the Customs
Act. Section 2(43) defines a ‘warehouse’ to mean a public warehouse
licensed under Section 57 or a private warehouse licensed under
Section 58 or a special warehouse licensed under Section 58A of the
Customs Act. ‘Warehoused goods’ has been defined under Section
2(44) to mean goods deposited in a warehouse.
28. Section 12 of the Customs Act deals with dutiable goods. Sub-
Section(1) thereof says that duties of customs shall be levied at
such rates as may be specified under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975
on goods imported into or exported from India.
29. Date for determination of rate of duty and tariff valuation of imported
goods is dealt with in Section 15. Sub-Section(1) of Section 15 says
that the rate of duty and tariff valuation, if any, applicable to any
imported goods shall be the rate and valuation in force-
(a) in the case of goods entered for home consumption
under Section 46, on the date on which a bill of
entry in respect of such goods is presented under
that section;
(b) in the case of goods cleared from a warehouse
under Section 68, on the date on which the goods
are actually removed from the warehouse;
(c) in the case of any other goods, on the date of
payment of duty.
902 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
30. While Section 28 provides for recovery of duties not levied or short
levied, Section 28AA deals with interest on delayed payment of duty.
On the other hand, Section 28AB provided for interest on delayed
payment of duty in special cases. Substance of Section 28AB (since
deleted) was that where any duty was not levied or paid or short
levied etc., the person who was liable to pay the duty would also be
liable to pay interest in addition to duty at such rate not below 10%
and not exceeding 36% per annum as may be fixed by the central
government by notification in the official gazette.
31. Chapter IX of the Customs Act comprising of Sections 57 to 73A
deal with warehousing. Section 57 provides for licensing of public
warehouses where dutiable goods may be warehoused. As per
Section 58, as it stood at the relevant time, the proper officer may
license a private warehouse where dutiable goods imported by or
on behalf of the licensee or any other imported goods in respect of
which facilities for deposit in a public warehouse are not available,
may be deposited. Sub-Section(2) provides for cancellation of
license so granted by giving a month’s written notice in advance if
the licensee had contravened any of the provisions of the Customs
Act or committed breach of any of the conditions of the license.
However, before such cancellation, the licensee was required to be
given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
32. ‘Warehousing bond’ is provided for in Section 59. As per sub-
Section(1), the importer of any goods specified in Section 61(1)
which had been entered for warehousing and assessed to duty
under Sections 17 or 18 shall execute a bond binding himself in a
sum equal to thrice the amount of the duty assessed on such goods.
33. As per Section 60, as it stood at the relevant point of time, when the
provisions of Section 59 have been complied with in respect of any
goods, the proper officer may make an order permitting the deposit
of goods in a warehouse.
34. Section 61 mentions the period for which the goods may remain
warehoused. Sub-Section (1) says that any warehoused goods
may be left in the warehouse in which they are deposited or in any
warehouse to which they may be removed-
(a) in the case of capital goods intended for use in any
hundred percent export-oriented undertaking, till the
expiry of five years;
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 903
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
(aa) in the case of goods other than capital goods intended
for use in any hundred percent export-oriented
undertaking, till the expiry of three years; and
(b) in the case of any other goods, till the expiry of one
year;
after the date on which the proper officer has made an order under
Section 60 permitting the deposit of the goods in a warehouse.
However, proviso (i) (B) says that in the case of any goods which
are not likely to deteriorate and which are not intended for use in any
hundred percent export oriented undertaking, the period specified
in clauses (a), (aa) or (b) may, on sufficient cause being shown,
be extended by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of
Customs for a period not exceeding six months and by the Principal
Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner of Customs for further
period as he may deem fit.
35. Section 64 deals with owner’s right to deal with warehoused
goods. Section 64, as it stood at the relevant point of time, read
as under:
64. Owner’s right to deal with warehoused goods.- With
the sanction of the proper officer and on payment of the
prescribed fees, the owner of any goods may either before
or after warehousing the same-
(a) inspect the goods;
(b) separate damaged or deteriorated goods from the
rest;
(c) sort the goods or change their containers for the
purpose of preservation, sale, export or disposal of
the goods;
(d) deal with the goods and their containers in such
manner as may be necessary to prevent loss or
deterioration or damage to the goods;
(e) show the goods for sale; or
(f) take samples of goods without entry for home
consumption, and if the proper officer so permits,
without payment of duty on such samples.
904 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
35.1. Thus, this section provided that the owner of any goods
with the sanction of the proper officer and on payment of
the prescribed fees may either before or after warehousing
the same, deal with the goods and their containers in such
manner as may be necessary to prevent loss or deterioration
or damage to the goods.
36. Section 67 deals with removal of goods from one warehouse to
another. It says that the owner of any warehoused goods may with
the permission of the proper officer, remove them from one warehouse
to another subject to such conditions as may be prescribed for the
due arrival of the warehoused goods at the warehouse to which
removal is permitted.
37. Heading of Section 68 is ‘Clearance of warehoused goods for home
consumption’. This section, as it stood at the relevant point of time,
provided that the importer of any warehoused goods may clear those
goods from the warehouse for home consumption if –
(a) a bill of entry for home consumption in respect of such
goods has been presented in the prescribed form;
(b) the import duty leviable on such goods and all
penalties rent, interest and other charges payable in
respect of such goods have been paid; and
(c) an order for clearance of such goods for home
consumption has been made by the proper officer.
38. There is an embargo provided in Section 71 from taking out goods
from a warehouse. As per Section 71, no warehoused goods shall be
taken out of a warehouse except on clearance for home consumption
or re-exportation or for removal to another warehouse or as otherwise
provided by the Customs Act.
39. Section 71 is followed by Section 72 which deals with goods improperly
removed from warehouse, etc. As per sub-Section(1)(b) where any
warehoused goods have not been removed from a warehouse at
the expiration of the period during which such goods are permitted
under Section 61 to remain in a warehouse, the proper officer may
demand and the owner of such goods shall forthwith pay, the full
amount of duty chargeable on account of such goods together with
all penalties, rent, interest and other charges payable in respect of
such goods.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 905
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
40. Once the goods covered by any bond executed under Section 59
have been cleared for home consumption or exported or transferred
or are otherwise duly accounted for, and when all amounts due on
account of such goods have been paid, the proper officer shall cancel
the bond as discharged in full and deliver the same after cancellation
to the person who has executed or is entitled to receive it.
41. Section 110(1) of the Customs Act empowers the proper officer to
seize any goods if he has reason to believe that such goods are
liable to confiscation under the Customs Act.
42. As per Section 111(j), any dutiable or prohibited goods removed
or attempted to be removed from a customs area or a warehouse
without the permission of the proper officer or contrary to the terms
of such permission, shall be liable for confiscation.
43. In the event of such an act, the concerned person shall be liable to
pay penalty under Section 112.
44. Central Board of Excise and Customs had issued Circular No.98/95-
Cus. dated 12.07.1989. Subject matter of this circular was what would
be the relevant date for calculation of customs duty in cases where
warehoused goods were cleared after expiry of the warehousing
period. Reference was made to the instructions of the Board dated
17.03.1987 where it was clarified that in cases where warehoused
goods were cleared from a warehouse after expiry of the bond period,
the rate of duty would be the one which was prevalent on the date
of expiry of the bond. The issue was reconsidered in the tripartite
meeting held between the Ministry of Law, Department of Revenue
and the Comptroller and Auditor General. It was observed in the
meeting that on expiry of the warehousing period, the goods kept in
a warehouse ceased to be warehoused goods and, therefore, their
removal from the warehouse could not be regarded as covered by
the provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act. After noting
that there was no specific legal provision to determine the rate of
duty in such cases of warehoused goods where the bond period
had expired, it was concluded that the residual clause of Section
15(1)(c) of the Customs Act could apply to cases where the goods
were removed from the warehouse after expiry of the warehousing
period and that the rate of duty in such cases would be the rate
prevalent on the date of payment of duty. It was further clarified that
provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act would continue to
906 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
apply in cases where goods were cleared from the warehouse after
extension of the warehousing period but before expiry of the extended
period for which applications from the importers for extension of
the warehousing period should be received before expiry of the
permitted period of warehousing. These conclusions reached in the
tripartite meeting were accepted by the Board and by the aforesaid
circular dated 12.07.1989, direction was issued for their immediate
implementation superseding the instructions dated 17.03.1987.
45. The above provision continued to hold the field till the decision of
this Court in Kesoram Rayon versus Collector of Customs, Calcutta,
(1996) 5 SCC 576. The question for consideration in Kesoram was
the rate at which customs duty was to be levied on goods that
remained in a bonded warehouse beyond the permitted period. A
two judge bench of this Court after referring to various provisions
of the Customs Act held that Section 15(1)(b) would apply to the
case of goods cleared under Section 68 from a warehouse upon
presentation of a bill of entry for home consumption; payment of
duty, interest, penalty, rent and other charges; and an order for home
clearance. This Court clarified that provisions of Section 68 and
consequently Section 15(1)(b) would apply only when goods have
been cleared from the warehouse within the permitted period or its
permitted extension and not when by reason of their remaining in the
warehouse beyond the permitted period or its permitted extension,
the goods would be deemed to have been improperly removed from
the warehouse under Section 72. In the facts of that case, it was
found that there was nothing on record to suggest that clearance of
the goods in question under Section 68 was ordered and, therefore,
Section 15(1)(b) had no application. Finally, this Court held that the
consequence of non-removal of the warehoused goods within the
permitted period or the permitted extension by virtue of Section 72
is certain. The date on which it comes to an end is the date relevant
for determining the rate of duty; when the duty is in fact demanded
is not relevant.
46. Following the decision of this Court in Kesoram, the Central Board of
Excise and Customs issued Circular No.31/97-Cus. dated 14.08.1997.
The Board held that in view of this Court’s judgment, the date of
payment of duty in the case of warehoused goods removed after
expiry of the permissible or extended period would be the date of
expiry of the warehousing period or such other extended period,
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 907
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
as the case may be, and not the date of payment of duty. Goods
not removed from a warehouse within the permissible period or the
extended period are to be treated as goods improperly removed
from the warehouse.
47. In Simplex Castings Ltd. versus Commissioner of Customs,
Vishakhapatnam, (2003) 5 SCC 528, the appellant had questioned
filing of appeal by the Commissioner before the CEGAT in view of the
circular dated 12.07.1989 issued by the Central Board of Excise and
Customs. It was argued that it was not open to the Commissioner to
take the stand that non-removal of the goods from the warehouse
after the period of warehousing was over would be deemed removal
from the warehouse and that the rate of duty would be leviable from
the date the period of warehousing was over. The Commissioner had
appealed against the decision of the Collector of Customs (Appeals)
in which the circular dated 12.07.1989 was followed. The appeal
filed by the Commissioner was allowed by the CEGAT by relying
upon the decision of this Court in Kesoram. This Court referred to
its earlier decision in Paper Products Ltd. versus Commissioner of
Central Excise, (1999) 7 SCC 84, and held that the circular dated
12.07.1989 was binding on the Department and, therefore, it was
not open to the Department to prefer appeal before CEGAT contrary
to what was laid down in the circular dated 12.07.1989 in which it
was specifically provided that the residual Section 15(1)(c) of the
Customs Act would apply to cases where the goods were removed
from a warehouse after expiry of the warehousing period and that
the rate of duty in such cases would be the rate prevalent on the
date of payment of duty. This Court noted that the aforesaid circular
dated 12.07.1989 was withdrawn by the subsequent circular dated
14.08.1997. But, at the relevant point of time, the circular dated
12.07.1989 was holding the field. Thus, the appellate order passed by
the Collector of Customs (Appeal) could not be said to be in anyway
illegal or erroneous and, therefore, it was not open to the Department
to challenge the said order before the CEGAT in contravention of
the circular dated 12.07.1989.
48. The decision in Kesoram was approved and applied by a coordinate
bench of this Court in SBEC Sugar Ltd versus Union of India, (2011)
4 SCC 668. This Court held that Section 15(1)(b) would be applicable
only when the goods are cleared from the warehouse under Section
68 of the Customs Act i.e. within the initially permitted period or during
908 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the permitted extended period. When the goods are cleared from
the warehouse after expiry of the permitted period or its permitted
extension, the goods are deemed to have been improperly removed
under Section 72(1)(b) of the Customs Act with the consequence that
the rate of duty has to be computed according to the rate applicable
on the date of expiry of the permitted period under Section 61.
49. Let us now briefly recap the facts. Appellant had imported second
hand steel mill machinery and parts covered by three transit bonds
totalling 595 cases. The customs authority had notified an open
area of 2000 square meters within the industrial/factory premises of
the appellant as a public bonded warehouse. This open area was
fenced and had gate with locking arrangement. The imported goods
covered by the 595 cases were required to be warehoused in the
said notified public bonded warehouse without payment of customs
duty. Appellant had written a letter dated 30.08.1989 to the concerned
Superintendent seeking permission to unload a portion of the cargo
outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. It was pointed
out that the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the
said warehouse as because those trailers had got stuck in the soil
outside the warehouse but within the factory premises as the soil
had become very sluggish due to heavy rain and also because of
paucity of space within the notified open area. The Superintendent
gave permission on the body of the letter itself for unloading the
cargo outside the warehouse but within the factory premises. The
machinery parts which were thus unloaded were shifted to a shed
outside the bonded warehouse but within the factory premises of
the appellant so that those machinery parts did not get damaged,
lying in the open and getting exposed to the elements.
49.1. Officials of the Preventive Branch of the Commissionerate
searched the industrial premises of the appellant, including the
notified public bonded warehouse, on 07.08.1992 and physically
verified the stock in the notified public bonded warehouse as
well as outside but within the industrial/factory premises of the
appellant. On such verification, it was found that only 304 cases
were stocked inside the warehouse, whereas 264 cases were
found outside the warehouse but within the industrial/factory
premises of the appellant. Remaining 27 cases were neither
found inside the warehouse nor outside the warehouse but
within the industrial/factory premises of the appellant.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 909
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
49.2. After issuance of show cause notice and hearing, respondent
passed adjudication order dated 28.08.1996 which suffered
several rounds of appeals and remand. Ultimately, the
Commissioner passed the final adjudication order dated
28.04.2005 whereby demand of Rs.3,99,255.00 leviable on
the 27 cases found not warehoused was confirmed. Appellant
was also directed to pay interest on the said duty in terms of
Section 28AB of the Customs Act. The 264 cases of imported
goods found outside the notified warehouse were confiscated
but option of redemption was given to the appellant on
payment of fine of Rs.2,00,000.00. For the goods covered by
the 264 cases, customs duty amounting to Rs.39,03,821.00
was directed to be recovered from the appellant in terms of
Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28A of the Customs
Act. That apart, appellant was directed to pay interest of
Rs.18,88,425.00 on the aforesaid quantum of customs duty in
respect of the 264 cases from the date of warehousing till the
date of detection of the shortage in the warehouse. Further,
appellant was directed to pay interest under Section 28AB
in respect of the 264 cases from the date of enforcement of
the said section to till the date of actual payment of the duty.
Penalty of Rs.1,00,000.00 was also imposed on the appellant
under Section 112 of the Customs Act.
49.3. In appeal, CESTAT by the impugned order affirmed the
aforesaid decision of the Commissioner.
50. We may mention that the permission granted by the Superintendent to
the appellant on 30.08.1989 to unload a portion of the cargo outside
the open space which was notified as public bonded warehouse but
within the factory premises of the appellant was neither cancelled nor
revoked by the Superintendent or even by the Commissioner. Infact,
a view can reasonably be taken that the appellant as the owner of
the goods had exercised its right under Section 64(d) which was
endorsed by the Superintendent. Therefore, it would not be correct
to say that the 264 cases found outside the notified warehouse
but within the factory premises of the appellant were improperly or
unauthorisedly removed from the notified public bonded warehouse.
51. It has also come on record that Central Warehousing Corporation
had deposited a sum of Rs.56,10,294.00 with the respondent as
910 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
custom establishment charges in respect of the aforesaid notified
public bonded warehouse for the period 1992-1993 to 2007-2008.
This would mean that the warehousing in the aforesaid notified
public bonded warehouse continued during the said period. Thus,
the period of warehousing had not expired and continued to remain
operational in terms of the proviso to Section 61 of the Customs Act.
52. This would further be borne out from the fact that it is not the case
of the respondent that the 304 cases found inside the notified
warehouse were kept there beyond the warehousing period. In fact,
the allegation of the respondent is that 264 cases were improperly or
unauthorisedly removed from the notified warehouse as those were
found lying outside the notified area but within the industrial/factory
premises of the appellant. That apart, 27 cases were neither found
inside the notified warehouse nor outside the said warehouse but
within the factory premises of the appellant.
53. In such a scenario, the provisions of Sections 71 and 72 would not
be applicable. Therefore, the decision of the respondent to invoke
Section 71 and thereafter levy interest on the goods covered by the
264 cases under Section 28AB of the Customs Act was not justified.
Since the imported goods covered by the 264 cases were never
warehoused inside the notified public bonded warehouse but were
unloaded outside the notified area but within the factory premises
of the appellant and kept under a shed on permission granted by
the Superintendent which permission was neither cancelled nor
revoked, question of warehousing the goods covered by the 264
cases within the notified public bonded warehouse did not arise.
As a corollary, the further question of improperly or unauthorisedly
removing the 264 cases from the notified warehouse to outside the
said area but within the factory premises of the appellant attracting
Section 71 and the consequences following the same did not arise.
Inference drawn by the respondent that the permission granted by
the Superintendent was only temporary and therefore, the rigor of
Section 71 would be attracted, in our view, would not be a correct
understanding of the situation and the law.
54. Having said that, we find that there is no explanation on the part of
the appellant qua the missing 27 cases. Therefore, the view taken
by the respondent and affirmed by the CESTAT that those 27 cases
were improperly or unauthorisedly removed from the notified public
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 911
M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise
bonded warehouse is correct and requires no interference.
55. Reverting back to the 264 cases, we are of the view that in a case
of this nature, Section 15(1)(b) would have no application. Rather,
Section 15(1)(c) would be attracted.
56. In so far the Board’s circular dated 12.07.1989 is concerned, the
subject matter of the said circular was what would be the relevant
date for calculation of customs duty in cases where warehoused
goods were cleared after expiry of the warehousing period. In that
context, it was clarified that provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the
Customs Act would apply to cases where the goods were cleared
from the warehouse after extension of the warehousing period
but before expiry of such extended period. On the other hand, in
respect of cases where the goods were removed after expiry of the
warehousing period, the residual clause of Section 15(1)(c) of the
Customs Act would apply. Evidently, this circular dated 12.7.1989
would not be applicable to the facts of the present case in as much
as it is not the case of the respondent that either the warehousing
period had expired or that the warehousing period was extended.
As we have seen, the warehousing in the notified public bonded
warehouse continued as the Corporation had deposited with the
respondent a sum of Rs. 56,10,294.00 in respect of the notified
warehouse as custom establishment charges for the period from
1992-1993 to 2007-2008. That apart, we can refer to the fact that
respondent had not levied any customs duty on the 304 cases
found within the notified area which would mean that the notified
warehousing continued. Therefore, this is not a case where Section
15(1)(b) could have been invoked.
57. As regards, the decision of this Court in Kesoram is concerned, the
question for consideration in that case was the rate at which customs
duty could be levied on goods that remained in a bonded warehouse
beyond the permitted period. It was in that context that this Court held
that Section 68 would not be applicable since Section 68 operates in
a different context. On the contrary, Section 72 would apply. Thus,
this Court clarified that the date on which the warehousing period
comes to an end, would be the date relevant for determining the
rate of duty and when the duty is actually demanded would not be
relevant. It was further clarified that Section 15(1)(b) would apply to
goods cleared under Section 68. Goods which remain in the bonded

warehouse beyond the permitted period would be deemed to have
been improperly removed from the warehouse under Section 72.
It is quite evident that this decision would not be applicable to the
facts of the present case.
58. Thus, having regard to the discussions made above, we are of
the view that the demand raised by the respondent against the
appellant and affirmed by the CESTAT qua the 264 cases including
levy of customs duty and interest cannot be sustained. Those are
accordingly set aside and quashed. Parties are directed to work out
their remedies in respect of the 264 cases of goods under Section
15(1)(c) of the Customs Act within a period of eight weeks from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order. In so far the demand of
customs duty and interest on the 27 cases is concerned, the same
is hereby sustained. The decision imposing penalty of rupees one
lakh on the appellant under Section 112 of the Customs Act is also
not disturbed in view of the conduct of the appellant in unauthorisedly
removing the 27 cases of imported goods not only from the notified
public bonded warehouse but also from the industrial/factory premises
of the appellant.
59. Impugned order of CESTAT would stand modified accordingly.
60. Appeal is allowed in part in the above terms. No costs.

v.
State of Madhya Pradesh
(Criminal Appeal No. 2806 of 2024)
08 July 2024
[Surya Kant* and K. V. Viswanathan, JJ.]","High Court if justified in upholding conviction and sentence of the
appellant under ss. 302/34 IPC; the contradictions or discrepancies
and the absence of blood group classification or inconclusive FSL
results on the recovered weapon, if detrimental to the prosecution’s
case; the Investigating Officer’s failure to obtain a fitness certificate
from the medical officer, if would invalidate the consideration of
the statement of the deceased recorded u/s. 161 CrPC before his
death, as a ‘dying declaration; and disclosure statement made by
the appellant leading to the discovery and subsequent seizure of
the knife, if admissible in evidence.
","Penal Code, 1860 – ss. 302/34 – Conviction and sentence
under – On facts, dispute over construction of wall – Verbal
abuses hurled at the complainant – Two persons who
constructed the wall physically assaulted by the opposite party,
the appellant inflicted knife blow to one, and later both of them
succumbed to their injuries – Appellant convicted u/ss. 302,
147, 148, and 149 and sentenced to life imprisonment – High
Court upheld the appellant’s conviction u/s. 302/34, however,
acquitted him u/ss. 147 and 148 – Correctness:
Held: No contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case
that would compel to take a view different than that of the courts
below – When the testimonies of eyewitnesses are consistent,
unimpeachable, and duly corroborated by medical evidence or
the recovery of incriminating material like the weapon used, the
deficiencies, if any, in the recording of FIR alone do not constitute a
valid ground to overturn the conviction or undermine the prosecution

of occurrence established – Disclosure statement by the appellant
leading to the discovery and seizure of the knife admissible in
evidence – Knife injury can be attributed to the appellant – Absence
of blood group classification or inconclusive FSL results on the
recovered weapon would not effect the prosecution case – Also,
mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate would not
deter the court from considering a properly recorded statement u/s.
161 CrPC, to be a dying declaration – Thus, the order passed by
the High Court upheld – Evidence.[Paras 44, 51, 58, 61, 69, 70]
Evidence – Contradictions in the prosecution case – Omission
on the part of the Investigating Officer in marking a spot where
incident took place, on the site plan – Effect:
Held: Mere omission on the part of the Investigating Officer does
not deflect the prosecution case – Site plan merely denotes the
location of the incident without implying further details – In light
of the fact that the persons who had seen that to which they
have testified, due weightage must be given to their first-hand
version – Their evidence cannot be jettisoned merely because the
I.O. forgot to describe the room on the spot map – It is a case
where eyewitnesses corroborated each other; their depositions
are reinforced by deceased himself in his statement recorded
u/s. 161 CrPC, and the location of the incident is depicted on the
spot map as a `brick room’ – Thus, stands established that there
was another Jhuggi where the deceased sought refuge and was
eventually assaulted – So-called contradiction fails to invade the
corpus delicti. [Paras 33, 34]
First information report – Non-reading of contents of FIR to
the complainant – Effect:
Held: Subject FIR fully satisfies all the ingredients of s. 154 CrPC –
During the cross-examination, the complainant-informant claimed
that the Police neither read out the FIR to her nor did it mention
the contents of her statements which were recorded by the Police –
Assuming it to be correct, such omission did not cause any prejudice
to the appellant – Not a case where the appellant was not provided
with a copy of the FIR or the charge sheet, which could have
hindered his ability to effectively cross-examine the informant – Also
no suggestion that he was not present at the scene, that he did
not participate in the incident, or that he was falsely implicated for
any reason – Appellant, thus, failed to demonstrate any prejudice
resulting from the alleged non-reading of the contents of the FIR
220 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to the informant – Reading over of the information after it is written
down, the signing of the said information by the informant, and
the entry of its substance in the prescribed manner not obligatory,
but procedural in nature, and the omission of any of them does
not impact the legal consequences resulting from the information
provided – Furthermore, when testimonies of eyewitnesses are
consistent, unimpeachable, and duly corroborated by medical
evidence or recovery of weapon used, the deficiencies, if any, in
recording of FIR alone do not constitute a valid ground to overturn
the conviction or undermine the prosecution case. [Paras 40-44]
Evidence – Presence of appellant on the place of occurrence,
if doubtful:
Held: No reason to doubt that the appellant was not only present
at the scene of crime, but he actively participated in the occurrence
and gave one of the fatal blows to deceased – Submission of poor
visibility owing to darkness at the spot of occurrence not tenable –
Place of occurrence, was adjacent to that of the complainant making
it easier for the witnesses to observe and identify the accused
persons – Each accused, particularly the appellant, was familiar
to the eyewitnesses – Considering that the incident occurred on
a summer night, there would have been minimal obstruction to
visibility for the witnesses – Appellant, in his 313 CrPC statement,
nowhere took the plea of alibi also did not pursue this defence
during the cross-examination of witnesses either, as also did not
adduce any evidence in support thereof – Furthermore, not a
case where the complainant or prosecution witness held grudges
against the appellant and fabricated a story to implicate him after
the incident – Rather, the name of the appellant surfaced in the
very first version, duly recorded, within less than two hours of
the occurrence – Also no motive to falsely implicate the appellant
indicated.[Paras 48, 49, 51]
Evidence – Disclosure statement by the appellant leading to
the discovery and seizure of the knife-weapon of offence –
Admissibility in evidence – Knife injury, if can be attributed
to the appellant:
Held: Disclosure statement of the appellant to the extent it led to
the recovery of a knife correctly admitted in evidence – Prosecution
version was accepted by the courts below – It cannot be ignored
that both eyewitnesses, are illiterate labourers, and their testimonies
were recorded after a considerable length of time had passed since
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 221
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
the occurrence – Both the witnesses emphatically denied that they
were tutored by Police or anyone else – Unfiltered testimony of
a rustic witness, even if marred with some minor inconsistencies
or discrepancies, cannot debilitate its perseverance – Evidence
of such witnesses has to be evaluated comprehensively and
carefully, especially when the cross-examination discreetly suggests
that the accused persons did make a bid to win them over by
exerting some extraneous pressure – Thus, the statements of the
prosecution witness does not suffer from the discrepancy of such
a nature that they should be discarded – Even the testimony of
the Investigating Officer is devoid of any ulterior motive or attempt
to fabricate evidence or falsely implicate the appellant and his
co-accused – It would be too unfair and unreasonable to expect
a witness, unless parroted, to recall every minute detail of the
occurrence and present it with a totally accumulative narrative –
Appellant’s submission that knife injury was not caused by him,
bereft of any merit. [Paras 56-58]
Evidence – Absence of blood group classification –
Inconclusive FSL results on the recovered weapon – Effect
on the prosecution case:
Held: Upon a thorough examination of the FSL report, its
confirmed that the blood group classification test conducted on
the recovered knife yielded inconclusive results – However, the
human blood was detected on the knife recovered at the instance
of the appellant – Various weapons, including lathis and even
the knife attributed to accused underwent an FSL examination,
yet, no traces of human blood were found on them – Notably,
human blood was solely found on the knife used by the appellant
– Furthermore, non-explanation of human blood on the weapon
of crime constitutes a circumstance against the accused – It is
incumbent upon the accused to provide an explanation regarding
the presence of human blood on the weapon – Appellant failed
to do so – While it may not be a decisive factor to determine the
guilt, but conspicuous silence does lend support to prosecution
case. [Para 61]
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 161 – Statement made
by deceased to a police officer u/s. 161, regarding cause of
death – Admissibility as dying declaration:
Held: s.161 empowers the Police to examine orally any person
who is acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case
222 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
under investigation – Police may reduce such statement into
writing also – s. 162(1), nonetheless, mandates that no statement
made by any person to a Police Officer, if reduced to writing, be
signed by the person making it, nor shall such statement be used
in evidence except to contradict a witness in the manner provided
by s. 145 of the Evidence Act – However, Sub-Section (2) of s.
162 carves out an exception to Sub-Section (1) that nothing in s.
162 shall be deemed to apply to any statement falling within the
ambit of clause (1) of s. 32 of the Evidence Act – Statement made
by a person who is dead, as to the cause of his death or to the
circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, to
a Police Officer and which has been recorded u/s. 161, shall be
relevant and admissible, notwithstanding the express bar against
use of such statement in evidence contained therein – In such
eventuality, the statement recorded u/s. 161 assumes the character
of a dying declaration – Since extraordinary credence has been
given to such dying declaration, the court ought to be extremely
careful and cautious in placing reliance thereupon. [Para 64]
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 161 – Consideration
of the statement of one of the deceased recorded u/s. 161
before his death, as a dying declaration – Non-obtainment of
a medical fitness certificate by the investigating officer from
the medical officer – Effect:
Held: As regard to the assessment of mental fitness of the person
making a dying declaration, it is indubitably the responsibility of
the court to ensure that the declarant was in a sound state of
mind – This is because there are no rigid procedures mandated for
recording a dying declaration – If an eyewitness asserts that the
deceased was conscious and capable of making the declaration,
the medical opinion cannot override such affirmation, nor can the
dying declaration be disregarded solely for want of a doctor’s
fitness certification – Requirement for a dying declaration to be
recorded in the presence of a doctor, following certification of the
declarant’s mental fitness, is merely a matter of prudence – On
facts, investigating officer recorded the statement instantly, a day
after the incident, categorically stating that the medical report did
not mention that the condition of the declarant, was serious in
nature – On perusal of the statement, it is clear that the declarant
was in a fit condition as not only did he properly explain the incident
but has also markedly specified the role of the appellant – That
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 223
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
apart, the injuries found during the post-mortem examination
conducted by the doctor have duly corroborated the statement of
deceased – Mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate
would not deter the Court from considering a properly recorded
statement u/s. 161 to be a dying declaration. [Para 70]
First information report – Object of:
Held: FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence, and it can be
used only to corroborate or contradict the version of an informant –
Also written complaint to register the FIR not necessary – Even
an oral communication to the Police disclosing the commission
of a cognizable offence is sufficient to register the FIR – Object
of the FIR is to inform the jurisdictional Magistrate and the Police
Administration of the offence reported to the Police Station; to
acquaint the Judicial Officer before whom the case is ultimately
tried as to what are the actual facts stated immediately after the
occurrence and on what materials the investigation commenced;
and most importantly, to safeguard the accused against subsequent
variations, exaggerations or additions. [Paras 38, 39]

Surya Kant, J.
Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 19.12.2017, passed
by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur (hereinafter, ‘High
Court’), dismissing the Criminal Appeal filed by the Appellant against
his conviction and sentence under Section 302 read with Section
34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter, ‘IPC’) awarded by
the Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bhopal (hereinafter, ‘Trial
Court’) vide judgment and order dated 10.11.2005.
FACTS :
3. At this juncture, it is imperative to delve into the factual matrix to set
out the context of the present proceedings.
4. FIR No. 268 dated 20.06.2004 was registered at Police Station Kamla
Nagar, Bhopal under Sections 307, 147, 148, and 149 of IPC on the
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 225
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10). The said Complainant stated that
on the night of 20.06.2004, at around 9:30 pm, she was overseeing
the construction of the wall of her Jhuggi (hut) by Devi Singh @
Tillu, and Tularam. At that moment, accused persons, Ahmad and
his wife, Kanija Bi, arrived and objected to the construction. Tillu
asserted that it was their Jhuggi and they had the right to build the
wall. Meanwhile, other accused persons, including Vijay, Dharmendra
@ Dhamma (Appellant), Katchu @ Ramswaroop, Ballu, Ravi, and
Asgar, arrived and began verbally abusing the Complainant, Tillu, and
Tularam. The situation intensified as all the accused, including the
Appellant, rushed to physically assault Tillu. In defence, Tillu sought
refuge inside a nearby unoccupied Jhuggi belonging to one Bhairav
Shastri, locking the door from inside. However, the accused forcibly
entered Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi by breaking open the door. Once
inside, they surrounded Tillu, with the Appellant delivering a knife blow
to Tillu in his abdomen, while Asgar inflicted another blow slightly
lower on his stomach. Following this, the other accused persons
also physically assaulted Tillu using their fists and sticks. Meanwhile,
Tularam attempted to intervene, but he too was subjected to blows
from Katchu and Ahmad, resulting in injuries to his head and hands.
Upon hearing the commotion, residents from the locality arrived at
the scene, prompting the accused to flee. The Complainant further
stated that she attempted to intervene but was threatened with dire
consequences if she did not leave the area.
5. After the incident, Tillu and Tularam, both injured, were taken to
Katju Hospital for medical aid. The Emergency Medical Officer, Dr.
R.S. Vijayvargiya (P.W.4), noted Tillu’s lack of pulse, as well as two
stab wounds in his chest and three stab wounds in his abdomen,
indicating a critical condition. Upon examining Tularam, Dr. Vijayvargiya
observed severe injuries to the occipital and temporal regions of his
head. Subsequently, both injured persons were referred to Hamidia
Hospital for further treatment.
6. Tillu unfortunately succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead,
while Tularam was still alive and was admitted to Hamidia Hospital.
7. Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W. 13) conducted the post-mortem examination on
Tillu, determining that the cause of death was shock and haemorrhage
resulting from multiple stab wounds across the body and head injuries.
The wounds were inflicted by a sharp, penetrating weapon, causing
the stab injuries, while the head injuries were inflicted by a hard and
226 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
blunt object. The combined injuries to the head and abdomen were
deemed sufficient to cause death.
8. Girish Bohre, the Investigating Officer (P.W.14), commenced the
investigation by preparing a spot map (Ex.P.2) and also seized the
blood-stained pieces of the floor from the place of occurrence (Ex.P.31).
9. As Tularam was alive though critically injured, the Investigating Officer
(P.W. 14) documented his statement (Ex.P.40) under Section 161 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter, ‘CrPC’) wherein
Tularam recounted the events during the subject incident. Tularam
mentioned that he and Tillu were constructing the wall of Usha Bai’s
Jhuggi at Navgrah Mandir. Around 9:15 pm, Ahmad and his wife,
Kanija Bi, approached and opposed the construction. Despite Tillu’s
assertion that it was their wall, Ahmad persisted in preventing them.
Shortly after, Vijay, Dharmendra @ Dhamma (Appellant), Katchu
@ Ramaswaroop, Ballu, Ravi, and Asgar arrived, initiating verbal
abuse. The accused then assaulted Tillu, who sought refuge inside
Bhairav Shastri’s nearby Jhuggi, locking himself inside. The assailants
forcibly entered and surrounding Tillu, Dhamma (Appellant) inflicted
a knife blow to Tillu’s abdomen, while Asgar also stabbed him near
the navel. Additionally, the other accused engaged in physical assault
using sticks, lathis, and fists. When Tularam attempted to intervene,
Katchu and Ahmad struck him with sticks, inflicting injuries to his
head, hands, and body. Tularam noted that Lallu (P.W.11) and one
Ramesh were eyewitnesses to the incident.
10. Tularam too passed away approximately five days after undergoing
surgery in Hamidia Hospital. Dr. Neelam Srivastava (P.W.15)
conducted his post-mortem examination, concluding that the cause
of death was cardio-respiratory failure resulting from a head injury.
Moreover, the severity of the injury was such that it could have led
to death under normal circumstances. This injury, deemed homicidal,
was inflicted by hard, blunt, and heavy objects.
11. During the course of investigation, the Investigating Officer (P.W. 14),
following a disclosure statement (Ex.P.14) made by the Appellant,
recovered a knife, which the Appellant had concealed in Barrack
No. 2 of Police Line Nehru Nagar. Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) was
a witness to this recovery. The knife was then submitted for forensic
examination (Ex.P.39), where the human blood on the knife was
detected but the blood group classification was inconclusive.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 227
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
12. After the investigation, all the accused persons, including the Appellant,
were charged under Sections 147, 148, 302/149, 307/149 of IPC.
13. In the trial, the prosecution examined as many as 15 witnesses to
bring the guilt home, including Usha Bai, P.W.10 (Complainant) and
Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, both eyewitnesses. The prosecution case
is largely based upon the version of these two eyewitnesses, who
claimed that the fatal blows were caused to the victims in front of them.
14. The Trial Court, having found the version of the two eyewitnesses
(P.W.10 and P.W.11) to be trustworthy, which was duly corroborated
by the testimony of the Investigating Officer (P.W.14), the medical
evidence and the recovery of the weapon, held the Appellant guilty of
offences under Sections 302, 147, 148, and 149 of IPC and sentenced
him to undergo life imprisonment.
15. The High Court, vide the impugned judgment, upheld the Appellant’s
conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, though
it has acquitted him under Sections 147 and 148 of the IPC. The
High Court has held that: (i) The presence of the Appellant stood
established through the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11),
and his cross-examination further confirms that there was no motive
for falsely incriminating the Appellant; (ii) The allegations against the
Appellant, as detailed by eyewitnesses Usha Bai (P.W.10) and Lallu
Vishwakarma (P.W.11), were duly corroborated by the medical opinions
of Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15); (iii)
The statement given by deceased Tularam, as recorded by P.W.14,
aligns with other evidence relied upon for conviction; (iv) The weapon
(knife) was seized based on the disclosure statement of the Appellant,
making the recovery admissible under Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter, ‘IEA’); and (v) the testimony of
Investigating Officer, P.W.14, also corroborated the weapon’s seizure.
16. Discontented with his conviction, the Appellant is in appeal before us.
Contentions Of Parties :
17. Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, argued
that the High Court erred in upholding the Appellant’s conviction
under Section 302/34 IPC. Substantiating this, he made the following
submissions:
a) The prosecution’s case presented inherent contradictions. On
the one hand, the two eyewitnesses (P.W.10 and P.W.11),
228 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
relied upon by the courts below, testified that the entire incident
unfolded inside Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi, situated near that of
the Complainant, (P.W.10). On the other hand, the Investigating
Officer (P.W.14), during his cross-examination, stated that no
quarrel took place near P.W.10’s Jhuggi, and that there was no
‘Bhairon Baba Temple’ or residence near the site of occurrence.
It was argued that since the incident admittedly occurred inside
a Jhuggi, it is unbelievable that the eyewitnesses could have
seen it.
b) It was contended that the presence of the Appellant at the place
of incident is stoutly disputed, and such an inference can be
well drawn from the statement of the Complainant herself. The
incident took place around 9:30 pm, posing visibility challenges
for the witnesses. Usha Bai (the Complainant, P.W.10) has
deposed that she was familiar with accused Ahamd, Asghar Ali,
Ravi, and Kanija Bi but was aware of the other accused by name
only. This clearly indicates that P.W.10 was not acquainted with
the Appellant. Barring the eyewitness account, there is no other
credible evidence to suggest that the Appellant was present or
participated in the occurrence.
c) Further, the knife injury could not be attributed to the Appellant,
as testified by Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11), who explicitly stated
that he couldn’t discern who assaulted whom.
d) That apart, it was urged that the weapon confiscated from the
Appellant underwent a Forensic Science Laboratory (hereinafter,
‘FSL’) examination, producing inconclusive results, which
bolsters the Appellant’s case that he was falsely implicated.
e) Finally, it was canvassed that the statement of the deceased
Tularam, recorded by Investigating Officer Girish Bohre (P.W.14)
under Section 161 CrPC, could not have been considered a
‘dying declaration’ due to the absence of certification from the
doctor regarding Tularam’s mental fitness.
f) Even otherwise, a dying declaration made before the Investigating
Officer/ Police is always shrouded by suspicious circumstances
and no reliance thereupon can be made.
18. Per Contra, Ms. Mrinal Gopal Elker, learned counsel on behalf of the
State, argued that the impugned judgment dated 19.12.2017 does
not warrant any interference by this Court. She submitted as follows:
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 229
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
a) The Courts below have expressly affirmed the presence of
the Appellant at the site of incident and his involvement in the
occurrence, based on the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma
(P.W.11). She argued that Vishwakarma’s cross-examination
provides no reason to doubt his version qua the Appellant.
b) There is a specific accusation against the Appellant of inflicting
the knife blow on the deceased Tillu’s abdomen, which is
supported by the Medical Legal Certificate (MLC) conducted by
Dr. R.S. Vijayvargiya (P.W.4), who confirmed the presence of a
stab wound on the abdomen with profuse bleeding.
c) After he was apprehended, the Appellant voluntarily disclosed
the location of the concealed knife to the Investigating Officer
in the presence of witnesses. Such a recovery is admissible
in evidence as an incriminating material against the Appellant.
d) Finally, Ms. Elker highlighted that the courts below have rightly
considered the statement of deceased Tularam recorded under
Section 161 of CrPC as a ‘dying declaration’, corroborating the
prosecution’s case against the Appellant beyond any doubt.
ANALYSIS :
19. Having heard learned Senior Counsel/Counsel for the parties at a
considerable length and on perusal of the statements of eyewitnesses
along with other relevant material on record, we find that the following
three questions fall for our consideration in the present appeal:
A. Have the Courts below erred in not appreciating the contradictions
or discrepancies which would dislodge the prosecution’s case?
B. Is the absence of blood group classification or inconclusive FSL
results on the recovered weapon detrimental to the prosecution’s
case?
C. Does the Investigating Officer’s failure to obtain a fitness
certificate from the medical officer invalidate the consideration
of the statement of Tularam recorded under Section 161 CrPC
before his death, as a ‘dying declaration’?
A. CONTRADICTIONS IN THE PROSECUCTION’S CASE:
20. Since the prosecution case against the Appellant predominantly
hinges upon the testimonies of Usha Bai (P.W.10), Lallu Vishwakarma
230 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(P.W.11), Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13), Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15) and
Girish Bohre (P.W.14), we deem it appropriate to briefly summarise
their testimonies hereunder:
21. Usha Bai (P.W.10) swore that on 20.06.2004, around 9.00 p.m.,
she was overseeing the construction of wall of her Jhuggi by Devi
Singh alias Tillu and Tularam. Ahmad and Kanija Bi, two of the
accused, arrived and ordered them to halt construction. Following
this, Ahmad struck Tularam on the head with a lathi. Subsequently,
Asgar, Ahmad’s son, incited the other accused to attack, prompting
all the accused to rush in and assault Tillu, Tularam, and Lalaram
with various weapons like sticks, rods, and pipes. When P.W.10
attempted to intervene by grabbing Ahmad’s lathi, she was verbally
abused and told to step aside. Consequently, she retreated to the
sidelines. The accused continued to beat Tillu and Tularam until they
were incapacitated. Tillu succumbed to his injuries at the scene,
while Tularam was barely breathing. Immediately after the incident,
Tillu, Tularam, and Lalaram were rushed to Hamidia Hospital for
treatment by the Kamla Nagar Police Station. Tillu passed away en
route to the hospital. P.W.10 lodged a First Information Report (FIR)
(Ex.P.7) detailing the incident.
22. Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) recounted that the incident occurred
near a wall owned by Usha Bai (P.W.10). Around 8-9:30 pm, Ahmad
arrived wielding a lathi at the place of construction of Usha Bai’s
wall, where P.W.11 and Tillu were sharing a meal. Ahmad confronted
them, objecting to the wall’s construction. In response, Tillu urged
them to allow the construction to proceed. Subsequently, all the
other accused arrived and assaulted Tillu and another individual,
although P.W.11 couldn’t discern the specific assailants. The accused
wielded various weapons such as lathis, knives, sticks, rods, and
pipes during the attack. Tillu was found injured inside Bhairon Baba’s
room, while Tularam lay injured at the construction site. P.W.11 then
arranged for the injured to be transported in an auto. He noted that
Tillu’s intestines were protruding, which he wrapped in cloth and
placed in the auto. Additionally, Tularam had suffered traumatic and
haemorrhagic shock due to multiple injuries. The injured were then
taken to Hamidia Hospital. The Police subsequently confiscated
the knife and sticks from the Appellant (Ex.P.14) and prepared a
memorandum, which P.W.11 signed.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 231
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
23. In addition to the two eyewitnesses, the prosecution so as to lend
corroboration to the ocular evidence, called upon medical experts,
namely Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava (P.W.15),
who conducted the post-mortem examinations of Tillu and Tularam,
respectively.
24. Dr. C.S. Jain, P.W.13, reported that Tillu’s body was brought in for
post-mortem examination on 21.06.2004, revealing four stab wounds
on the front side of the abdomen, along with a laceration on the head
and three abrasions. He concluded that the stab wounds were inflicted
by a hard, sharp, and penetrating weapon, while the head injuries
were caused by a hard and blunt object. The combined injuries to the
head and abdomen were deemed sufficient to cause death.
25. Dr. Neelam Shrivastava, P.W.15, testified that Tularam’s body was
brought for post-mortem examination on 24.06.2004, revealing multiple
radial fractures, subdural subarachnoid haemorrhage, and various
wounds. She concluded that Tularam’s death resulted from respiratory
failure due to a head injury and its associated complications. The
severity of the injury was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary
course of nature, and it was determined to be homicidal, inflicted
by a hard, blunt, and heavy weapon. During cross-examination,
she clarified that Tularam did not sustain any injuries from knives or
swords on his body.
26. The prosecution also examined Girish Bohre, Investigating Officer
(P.W.14), of the subject incident. He testified how the investigation was
conducted, a spot map (Ex.P.2) of the location was prepared, and a
blood-stained piece of flooring was also seized from the place of the
incident. Additionally, he conducted a panchnama on Tillu’s dead body
(Ex.P.32). He apprehended the Appellant and interrogated him in the
presence of witnesses. During interrogation, the Appellant confessed
to hiding the knife used in the assault in Barrack No. 2 of the Police
Line Nehru Nagar. P.W.14 then drafted a memorandum, leading to the
recovery of an iron knife at the instance of the Appellant. Following
this, he arrested the Appellant and other co-accused. P.W.14 also
prepared a panchnama (Ex.P.34) of Tularam’s dead body.
27. It is pertinent to mention at this stage that Ajjharruddin (P.W.1),
Sukhram (P.W.2), and Reshambai (P.W.3) were also brought in as
eyewitnesses to the incident. However, they were deemed hostile
by the prosecution, as according to them, no incident occurred in
their presence.
232 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
28. It is noteworthy to mention here that during the trial of the Appellant
and other co-accused, one of the accused, Vijay Singh absconded.
Subsequent to the judgment of the Trial Court in 2005, that Vijay
Singh was apprehended and tried. The Trial Court vide another
judgment delivered in the year 2007, convicted him based on the
testimony of eyewitness Usha Bai (P.W.10), duly supported by the
medical opinions of Dr. C.S. Jain (P.W.13) and Dr. Neelam Shrivastava
(P.W.15) as well as the testimony of Girish Bohre, the Investigating
Officer (P.W.14).
29. Having elaborated on the testimonies of the key witnesses in the
instant case, we may now dredge up the contradictions highlighted
on behalf of the Appellant.
A.1 Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi
30. It was vehemently agitated that there is a latent dissension in the
testimonies of the witnesses regarding the location of the occurrence.
While Usha Bai, P.W.10 and Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, deposed
that the deceased Tillu entered the Jhuggi of Bhairav Shastri, where
he was subsequently surrounded and assaulted in the abdomen
by the Appellant wielding a knife, the Investigating Officer (P.W.14)
veraciously admitted during cross-examination that he was unaware
of any individual named Bhairon Baba residing near the scene of the
incident. The I.O. further clarified that there was no house or temple
associated with Bhairon Baba in the vicinity of the incident, which is
why he did not name it in the spot map (Ex.P.2).
31. We have thoroughly scrutinized the testimonies of the witnesses in
this regard. We find a consistent mention of Bhairav Shastri across all
prosecution accounts, with Bhairav Shastri also being loosely referred
to as Bhairon Baba. Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W. 11, has unerringly
stated in his testimony that the deceased Tillu was discovered
inside Bhairon Baba’s room following the incident. Additionally, the
presence of Bhairon Shastri’s Jhuggi is noted in Section 161 CrPC
statement of the deceased Tularam recorded by Girish Bohre, the
Investigating Officer (P.W.14), wherein he unequivocally stated that
Tillu sought refuge inside Bhairav Shastri’s hut and locked himself
in. The mention of Bhairon Shastri’s Jhuggi is also evident in the FIR
(Ex.P.7) filed by the Complainant, P.W.10, as well as in her statement
(Ex.D.1) recorded under Section 161 CrPC.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 233
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
32. It is true that while Girish Bohre (P.W.14), as per his statement,
was unaware of any Bhairon Baba near the scene of occurrence,
the location referred to as ‘Bhairon Shastri’s Jhuggi’ by the other
witnesses is indeed depicted on the spot map (Ex.P.2) prepared by
him. A plain examination of the spot map (Ex.P.2) reveals a marked
structure labelled ‘B’, identified as a `brick room’ where the deceased
took refuge. Even though the said structure is not captioned as
Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi or by any other name, it gives credence
to the version of the eye witnesses that Tillu was attacked in the
neighbouring Jhuggi. Moreover, the defence has not disputed the
depictions in the spot map while cross-examining the I.O. (P.W.14).
33. A mere omission on the part of the Investigating Officer in marking
a spot on the site plan does not deflect the prosecution’s case. It
is well-established that the site plan merely denotes the location of
the incident without implying further details.1 In light of the fact that
the persons who had seen that to which they have testified, due
weightage must be given to their first-hand version. Their evidence
cannot be jettisoned merely because the I.O. forgot to describe the
room as ‘Bhairav Shastri’s Jhuggi’ on the spot map.
34. It is a case where eyewitnesses have corroborated each other;
their depositions are reinforced by deceased Tularam himself in his
statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC, and the location of the
incident is depicted on the spot map (Ex.P.2) as a `brick room’. It,
thus, stands established that there was another Jhuggi where the
deceased sought refuge and was eventually assaulted. Given these
circumstances, the so-called contradiction miserably fails to invade
the corpus delicti.
A.2 Legal Effect of Non-reading of Contents of FIR to the
Complainant
35. It was then argued that the Complainant, Usha Bai (P.W.10), in
her cross-examination, has candidly admitted that the FIR (Ex.P.7)
was not read out to her and she put her thumb impression under
the instructions of the Police. Reliance is placed on her deposition
during cross-examination where she claims to have thumb marked
on a blank paper, whereupon Ex.P.7 was prepared.
1 Shivanna v. State of Hunsur Town Police (2010) 15 SCC 91
234 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
36. In order to appreciate the contention, we have gone through the
translated version of the statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10), which the
Appellant has appended along with the original paper book as well
as a part of “Compilation of Depositions of Witnesses”. Since the
translated version was seemingly incorrect, making it difficult to discern
as to what the witness had deposed, we have also gone through the
original Hindi version of Usha Bai’s (P.W.10) statement.
37. The statement of a witness has to be extolled in its entirety. It may
be recapitulated that Usha Bai (P.W.10), in her complaint which led
to the registration of the subject FIR, had categorically stated that,
“Vijay, Dharmendra @ Dhamma, Katchu @ Ramswaroop, Ballu,
Ravi, Asgar all came shouting that Tillu was indulging in Dadagiri and
he be finished today……...” The FIR further states that, “ye sabhee
log” [all these persons] started attacking, Tillu ran towards Bhairav
Shastri’s Jhuggi, entered and closed the door from inside to save
himself. “Sabhee ne” (all of them) forcefully broke the door open and
entered the Jhuggi and surrounded Tillu ….. and Dharmendra @
Dhamma (Appellant) then gave a knife blow in the abdomen of Tillu.
38. It must also be borne in mind that FIR is not a substantive piece of
evidence, and it can be used only to corroborate or contradict the
version of an Informant. It is also not necessary that there should
always be a written complaint to register the FIR. Even an oral
communication to the Police disclosing the commission of a cognizable
offence is sufficient to register the FIR.
39. The object of the FIR is three-fold: firstly, to inform the jurisdictional
Magistrate and the Police Administration of the offence that has been
reported to the Police Station; secondly, to acquaint the Judicial Officer
before whom the case is ultimately tried as to what are the actual facts
stated immediately after the occurrence and on what materials the
investigation commenced; thirdly and most importantly, to safeguard
the accused against subsequent variations, exaggerations or additions.
40. The subject FIR (Ex.P.7) fully satisfies all the ingredients of Section 154
CrPC. The occurrence is reported to have taken place on 20.06.2004
at 9.30 p.m., and the FIR was recorded on the same day at 10.45
p.m. The names of all the eight accused who allegedly participated
in the occurrence are duly recorded. The FIR is written in a natural,
consistent flow of handwriting, with no signs of spaces being left,
words being overwritten or shrunken, or any word or sentence being
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 235
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
interpolated. The last line of the FIR categorically records that the
report was read out and explained to the Informant. The FIR is in
the prescribed format and Usha Bai (P.W.10) has thereafter put her
thumb impression.
41. It is true that during her cross-examination, Usha Bai (P.W.10),
has claimed that the Police neither read out the FIR (Ex.P.7) to
her nor did it mention the contents of her statements which were
recorded by the Police on 5-6 occasions. She further stated that
it could not be determined what version was included in Ex.P.7
since she is not a literate person. It seems that the Appellant made
an overt attempt to influence the witness. However, despite Usha
Bai’s innocuous intent to help the Appellant from the wrath of law,
she could not deny the fact that the FIR was registered on her
complaint or that Tillu and Tularam suffered fatal injuries in the
occurrence reported by her.
42. Assuming that the Police failed to read out or apprise the informant
about the contents of the FIR, the question that falls for consideration
is whether such omission has caused any prejudice to the Appellant?
In our considered opinion, the answer has to be in the negative. This
is not a case where the Appellant was not provided with a copy of
the FIR or the charge sheet, which could have hindered his ability to
effectively cross-examine the Informant. The record reveals that Shri
A.K. Shrivastava, Advocate, cross-examined Usha Bai (P.W.10) on
behalf of the Appellant. Usha Bai did try to help the Appellant by not
disclosing his name as one of the accused, but she could not hide the
fact that besides Ahmad, Asgar, Ravi and Kanija Bi, she also knew
the other accused by their names. The Appellant is admittedly one of
those accused. She has further deposed that sabhee ne (all of them)
assaulted Tillu with lathi, rods and pipes. She further stated that when
she tried to intervene, Ahmad abused her and threatened to kill her.
She then went and stood at some distance and witnessed that those
aaropigan, i.e., all the accused, had given fatal assaults to Tillu and
Tularam. Most importantly, she further testified that she, along with
Lalaram, then went to the Police Station Kamla Nagar, whereafter the
Police Officials immediately sent Lalaram and Tularam for treatment
at Hamidia Hospital. Tillu, however, could not reach the hospital as
he succumbed to the injuries on the way. Additionally, in paragraph
4 of her deposition, Usha Bai (P.W.10) unmistakably states that she
reported the matter to Police Station Kamla Nagar through Ex.P.7,
236 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which is thumb marked by her. This part of her deposition has not
been questioned by the Appellant while cross-examining Usha Bai
(P.W.10). We have also gone through the Appellant’s own statement
recorded under Section 313 CrPC. Aside from a vague denial and
claims of false implication, there is no suggestion that he was not
present at the scene; that he did not participate in the incident, or that
he was falsely implicated for any reason. The Appellant, thus, has
failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the alleged non-
reading of the contents of the FIR to the Informant. The contention
raised in this regard is entirely misconceived.
43. Be that as it may, this Court in State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran 2 has
ruled that the stipulations outlined in Section 154 CrPC concerning
the reading over of the information after it is written down, the
signing of the said information by the informant, and the entry of
its substance in the prescribed manner are not obligatory. These
requirements are procedural in nature, and the omission of any of
them does not impact the legal consequences resulting from the
information provided under the section.
44. It is equally well-settled that when the testimonies of eyewitnesses
are consistent, unimpeachable, and duly corroborated by medical
evidence or the recovery of incriminating material like the weapon
used, the deficiencies, if any, in the recording of FIR alone do not
constitute a valid ground to overturn the conviction or undermine
the prosecution case.
A.3 Presence of Appellant on the Place of Occurrence
45. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant argued that it is a case
of false implication as the presence of the Appellant at the spot of
occurrence has not been established beyond doubt. He relied upon
the statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10), who, in the opening statement
of her examination-in-chief, named Ahmad, Asgar, Ravi and Kanija
Bi as accused and claimed that she did not know anyone else. It
was highlighted that Usha Bai (P.W.10) not only failed to name the
Appellant in her entire statement but also admitted during the cross-
examination that she never provided the names of the assailants,
as mentioned by the Police in the FIR (Ex.P.7).
2 (2013) 3 SCC 594
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 237
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
46. We are, however, not impressed by the submission. We say so for
the following reasons :
(a) The statement of Usha Bai (P.W.10) has to be read and
appreciated in its entirety and not in piecemeal.
(b) She, as discussed earlier, deposed that she knew the remaining
accused by name. She was indisputably referring to the remaining
accused who were present in court which included the Appellant
as well.
(c) She deposed that “all the accused” attacked Lalaram, Tularam
and Devi Singh @ Tillu with dandas, rods and pipes.
(d) She further deposed that all the accused assaulted Tillu and
Tularam with the intention to kill them.
(e) She also admitted that she went to Police Station Kamla
Nagar and got the FIR (Ex.P.7) lodged, which bore her thumb
impression.
(f) Having admitted these material facts, it would be too far-fetched
to dissect Usha Bai’s version to hold that the Appellant was not
present or participated in the occurrence.
(g) In any case, Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11), another eyewitness,
explicitly stated that the Appellant was present and he participated
in the incident by delivering a knife blow to Tillu’s abdomen.
(h) The knife injury attributed to the Appellant has been duly
established by Dr. R.S. Vijayvargiya (P.W.4) and Dr. C.S. Jain
(P.W.13).
(i) The Investigating Officer (P.W.14) successfully established the
recovery of the weapon of offence, namely a knife, based on the
Appellant’s disclosure statement. Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11),
who witnessed the recovery, supported the Investigating Officer’s
testimony.
(j) To dispel any doubts, Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) identified
the Appellant in court and specifically pointed out, “The person
standing in front wearing a check shirt is Dharmendra”.
47. It is trite law that identification tests (TIP) do not serve as substantive
evidence but are primarily intended to assist the investigating agency
in ensuring that their progress in investigating the offence is on the
238 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
correct path. Holding a TIP is not obligatory. Further, a failure to hold
TIP cannot be a ground to eschew the testimony of witnesses whose
evidence was concurrently accepted by the trial and appellate courts.3
Additionally, a failure to hold a parade would not make inadmissible
the evidence of identification in the court.4
48. Similarly, the contention of poor visibility owing to darkness at the
spot of occurrence is also not tenable. In analysing the incidents
occurring at night, this Court in Nathuni Yadav v. State of Bihar 5
has taken into account several factors, including:
(i) The proximity at which the assailants would have confronted
the injured.
(ii) The possibility of some ambient light reaching the scene from
the stars.
(iii) The familiarity of the witnesses with the appearance of each
assailant.
49. In the instant case, firstly, the place of occurrence, i.e., Bharav Shastri’s
Jhuggi, was adjacent to that of the Complainant (P.W.10) making it
easier for the witnesses to observe and identify the accused persons.
Secondly, each accused, particularly the Appellant, was familiar to
the eyewitnesses. Thirdly, considering that the incident occurred on a
summer night, there would have been minimal obstruction to visibility
for the witnesses. Fourthly and most importantly, the Appellant, in his
313 CrPC Statement, has nowhere taken the plea of alibi. He did not
pursue this defence during the cross-examination of witnesses either.
50. There is no gainsaying that whosoever pleads alibi in contrast and
derogation of the eyewitness version, is under cumbrous onus to prove
absence from the scene and time of crime. The Appellant not only
failed to raise this defence but also did not adduce any evidence in
support thereof. Taking into consideration the cumulative effect of all
these factors, we have no reason to doubt that the Appellant was not
only present at the scene of crime, but he actively participated also in
the occurrence and gave one of the fatal blows to Tillu (deceased).
3 State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu (2005) 11 SCC 600
4 Heera v. State of Rajasthan (2007) 10 SCC 175
5 [1996] Supp. 10 SCR 905 : (1998) 9 SCC 238
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 239
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
51. We cannot overlook the fact that in a situation where two people are
killed in a heated altercation, it is highly unlikely that the eyewitnesses
would want the real perpetrators to escape justice. In the absence of
any prior motive, it is not plausible that they would falsely accuse the
Appellant in this case. This is not a scenario where the Complainant
or P.W.11 held grudges against the Appellant and fabricated a story
to implicate him after the incident. Rather, the name of the Appellant
surfaced in the very first version, duly recorded vide Ex.P.7, within
less than two hours of the occurrence. Pertinently, no motive to
falsely implicate the Appellant has been suggested during the cross-
examination of the eyewitnesses.
A.4 Attribution of knife injury on the Appellant
52. It was maintained by Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant that
since the incident took place inside the Jhuggi and at night, it is highly
improbable that the witnesses could see the manner in which the
incident took place. Further, reliance was placed on the statement
of Lallu Vishwakarma, P.W.11, who stated that he could not see who
assaulted whom, and he could not tell which weapon was seized
from whom. It was, thus, asserted that there is not even an iota of
evidence to conclude that the knife injury was caused by the Appellant.
53. We have deeply analysed the submission. It is essential for this Court
to examine the Disclosure Statement (Ex.P.14) of the Appellant,
which resulted in the discovery of the weapon (knife) in question.
The statement reads as under:
“On 20.04.2004, I along with my companions Ahmad, Asgar,
Ravi, Vijay, Katchu @Ramswaroop, Ballu, and Kanija Bi
committed Maarpeet with Tillu @ Devi Singh with knife and
stick voluntarily, the knife, by which Tillu @ Devising was
assaulted by me, has been hidden by me in the Barrack
No. 2 of Police Line Nehru Nagar. Come with me, I will
hand over it to you.”
54. The disclosure statement made by the Appellant led to the discovery
and subsequent seizure of the knife, namely, the weapon of offence.
Subsequently, a seizure memo (Ex.P.20) was prepared, which stated
as follows:
“One knife made of iron with wooden handle the total
length of which is about 14 ½ inches, the length of handle
is about 4 ¾ inches and length of blade is about 10 inches
240 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and width of blade is about 1 ¼ inches, the tip of knife is
pointed, blood is present in the front (agla) part of the blade
which has dried up. On producing by accused Dharmendra
@ Dhamma, the same was taken in possession of Police
and sealed pack on the spot itself as evidence.”
55. The question that requires determination is whether the above-stated
disclosure statement is admissible in evidence? The issue regarding
the admissibility of a disclosure statement within the meaning of
Section 27 of the IEA was comprehensively addressed by this Court
in Pulukuri Kottaya v. Emperor,6 delineating the following briefly
summed up criteria:
(i) There should be a discovery of the fact.
(ii) The discovery of fact should be in consequence of information
received from a person accused of an offence.
(iii) The person giving the information should be in the custody of
a Police Officer.
(iv) Only that portion of information which relates distinctly or strictly
to the fact discovered can be proved.
56. The testimony of the Investigating Officer (P.W.14) unfolds that the
Appellant voluntarily made the disclosure statement while he was
in police custody, pursuant to which the weapon of offence (knife)
was recovered. Whether the said statement was made voluntarily
or was secured through coercion is essentially a question of fact. In
this regard, the testimony of Lallu Vishwakarma (P.W.11) assumes
significance as the disclosure statement was duly witnessed by him.
In our considered opinion, the disclosure statement of the Appellant
to the extent it led to the recovery of a knife fulfils the basic tenets
of Section 27 of IEA and has been correctly admitted in evidence.
57. We may hasten to add at this stage that the prosecution version
was not only accepted by the Trial Court but the High Court has also
affirmed it in appeal. In our quest to find out whether the Appellant
is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we have expanded the wings
of our limited jurisdiction and assumed the role akin to that of the 1st
Appellate Court. We are conscious of the fact that the jurisdictional
6 1946 SCC OnLine PC 47
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 241
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
magnification ought to be an exception and be invoked with great
circumspection, in a case of extreme hardship, after taking into
consideration the socio-economic conditions of the victim(s) of a
crime, the accused, as well as the vulnerable witnesses. Keeping
such parameters in view, it cannot be ignored that both eyewitnesses,
P.W.10 and P.W.11, are illiterate labourers, and their testimonies were
recorded after a considerable length of time had passed since the
occurrence. Both the witnesses have emphatically denied that they
were tutored by Police or anyone else. The unfiltered testimony of
a rustic witness, even if marred with some minor inconsistencies or
discrepancies, cannot debilitate its perseverance. The evidence of
such witnesses has to be evaluated comprehensively and carefully,
especially when the cross-examination discreetly suggests that the
accused person(s) did make a bid to win them over by exerting some
extraneous pressure. We are, thus, satisfied that the statements of
P.W.10 and P.W.11 do not suffer from the discrepancy of such a nature
that they should be discarded. Even the testimony of the Investigating
Officer (P.W.14) is devoid of any ulterior motive or attempt to fabricate
evidence or falsely implicate the Appellant and his co-accused.
58. It would be too unfair and unreasonable to expect a witness, unless
parroted, to recall every minute detail of the occurrence and present
it with a totally accumulative narrative. The Appellant’s contention is
thus bereft of any merit.
B. Effect of Absence of Blood Group Classification on
Prosecution’s Case
59. Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of Appellant asserted that the
knife purportedly retrieved from him underwent examination at the
Forensic Science Laboratory, where the test results were inconclusive,
particularly regarding the determination of the blood group on the
weapon. Consequently, the absence of a conclusive match in the
blood group analysis should be construed in favour of the Appellant
and against the prosecution.
60. Upon a thorough examination of the FSL report, it stands confirmed
that the blood group classification test conducted on the recovered
knife yielded inconclusive results. However, it is crucial to note that
human blood was detected on the knife recovered at the instance of
the Appellant (Exhibit “I” before FSL). This fact gains some importance,
considering that various weapons, including lathis and even the knife
242 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
attributed to accused Asgar, underwent an FSL examination, yet, no
traces of human blood were found on them. Notably, human blood
was solely found on the knife used by the Appellant.
61. In line with the precedents set forth by this Court in Raja @ Rajinder
v. State of Haryana7 and John Pandian v. State8, the non-explanation
of human blood on the weapon of crime constitutes a circumstance
against the accused. It is incumbent upon the accused to provide
an explanation regarding the presence of human blood on the
weapon. The Appellant has failed to do so. The judgments delivered
by both the Trial Court and the High Court also do not reveal that
the Appellant rendered any satisfactory explanation concerning the
presence of blood on the recovered knife. Top of Form While it may
not be a decisive factor to determine the guilt, but a conspicuous
silence does lend support to the prosecution case.
C. Consideration of Section 161 CrPC Statement of Deceased
Tularam as Dying Declaration
62. It is contended on behalf of the Appellant that the courts below
have erred in relying on the statement of Tularam (Ex.P.40) given
to Investigating Officer, Girish Bohre (P.W.14) and that the said
statement cannot be considered to be a ‘dying declaration’ as the
Investigating Officer did not take any certification from the doctor
regarding the fitness of mind of Tularam.
63. In this regard, the following part of the testimony of Investigating
Officer, Girish Bohre (P.W.14), who recorded the statement of Tularam
under Section 161 CrPC, becomes quintessential:
“It is correct that I did not take permission from the Doctor
about the condition of giving statement of Tularam before
recording statement of Tularam. It is correct that I knew this
fact at the time of recording statement that one person has
died in this case. As head injury was not told to be serious
in the Medical Report, so it is incorrect to say that I knew
this fact that Tularam had sustained lathi blow on his head
and his condition was serious. It is incorrect to say that head
injury caused to Tularam was serious and his condition was

8 [2010] 15 SCR 1012 : (2010) 14 SCC 129
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 243
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
told to be serious in his medical report. It is correct that
proceedings of recording dying declaration of Tularam was
not conducted by me till Tularam was alive. It is incorrect
to say that Tularam was not able to speak after sustaining
the injuries and till his death, so I did not record his dying
declaration. It is incorrect to say that due to this reason
the statement of Exhibit P.40 has been falsely prepared.”
64. Before we proceed further, it would be apt to recapitulate Section 32(1)
of the IEA, whereunder the statement made by a person, who is dead,
as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the
transaction which resulted in his death, is relevant and admissible,
irrespective of the fact that such person at the time of making the
statement was not under expectation of death.
65. Section 161 CrPC empowers the Police to examine orally any
person who is acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the
case under investigation. The Police may reduce such statement
into writing also. Section 162(1) CrPC, nonetheless, mandates that
no statement made by any person to a Police Officer, if reduced to
writing, be signed by the person making it, nor shall such statement
be used in evidence except to contradict a witness in the manner
provided by Section 145 of the IEA. However, Sub-Section (2) of
Section 162 CrPC carves out an exception to Sub-Section (1) as it
explicitly provides that nothing in Section 162 shall be deemed to
apply to any statement falling within the ambit of clause (1) of Section
32 of the IEA. In other words, a statement made by a person who
is dead, as to the cause of his death or to the circumstances of the
transaction which resulted in his death, to a Police Officer and which
has been recorded under Section 161 CrPC, shall be relevant and
admissible, notwithstanding the express bar against use of such
statement in evidence contained therein. In such eventuality, the
statement recorded under Section 161 CrPC assumes the character
of a dying declaration. Since extraordinary credence has been given
to such dying declaration, the court ought to be extremely careful
and cautious in placing reliance thereupon. There are a catena of
decisions of this Court which lend support to the inter-play between
provisions of the CrPC and the IEA, as explained above9.

U.P. (2013) 12 SCC 137; (iii) Pradeep Bisoi v. State of Odisha (2019) 11 SCC 500
244 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
66. As regard to the assessment of mental fitness of the person making
a dying declaration, it is indubitably the responsibility of the court
to ensure that the declarant was in a sound state of mind. This is
because there are no rigid procedures mandated for recording a
dying declaration. If an eyewitness asserts that the deceased was
conscious and capable of making the declaration, the medical opinion
cannot override such affirmation, nor can the dying declaration be
disregarded solely for want of a doctor’s fitness certification. The
requirement for a dying declaration to be recorded in the presence
of a doctor, following certification of the declarant’s mental fitness,
is merely a matter of prudence.10
67. The Constitution Bench in Laxman v. State of Maharashtra11 has
authoritatively ruled that:
“3. … …But where the eyewitnesses state that the deceased
was in a fit and conscious state to make the declaration,
the medical opinion will not prevail, nor can it be said that
since there is no certification of the doctor as to the fitness
of the mind of the declarant, the dying declaration is not
acceptable. A dying declaration can be oral or in writing
and any adequate method of communication whether by
words or by signs or otherwise will suffice provided the
indication is positive and definite. In most cases, however,
such statements are made orally before death ensues and
is reduced to writing by someone like a Magistrate or a
doctor or a police officer. … … What is essentially required
is that the person who records a dying declaration must
be satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind.
Where it is proved by the testimony of the Magistrate that
the declarant was fit to make the statement even without
examination by the doctor the declaration can be acted
upon provided the court ultimately holds the same to
be voluntary and truthful. A certification by the doctor is
essentially a rule of caution and therefore the voluntary
and truthful nature of the declaration can be established
otherwise.”
10 Koli Chunilal Savji v. State of Gujarat (1999) 9 SCC 562
11 [2002] Supp. 1 SCR 697 : (2002) 6 SCC 710
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 245
Dharmendra Kumar @ Dhamma v. State of Madhya Pradesh
68. It is important in this case to appreciate that the Investigating Officer
recorded the statement instantly, a day after the incident. He has
categorically stated that the medical report did not mention that the
condition of the declarant, Tularam, was serious in nature. More
importantly, Tularam was able to convey his statement properly.
Furthermore, on perusal of the statement, it is clear that the declarant
Tularam was in a fit condition as not only did he properly explain the
incident but has also markedly specified the role of the Appellant.
That apart, the injuries found during the post-mortem examination
conducted by P.W.13 and P.W.15 have duly corroborated the
statement of deceased Tularam.
69. From the above discussion, it is manifest that the mere non-
obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter this Court
from considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161
CrPC to be a dying declaration.
","70. For the reasons stated above, we are satisfied that there are no
contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case of such a
nature that would compel us to take a view different than that of the
Trial Court and the High Court. We, therefore, do not find any merit
in this appeal, which is, consequently, dismissed. If the Appellant is
on bail, his bail bonds are cancelled, and he is directed to surrender
and undergo the remainder of the sentence. However, if the Appellant
is already in custody, in that event, he shall complete the remainder
of the sentence.
71. Ordered accordingly.
Result of the case: Appeal dismissed.

","Judgment
B.R. Gavai, J.
1. These appeals challenge the judgment and order passed by the
Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka, Circuit Bench at
Dharwad dated 02.02.2009, vide which the appeal filed by the M/s.
Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association, which is respondent No.1
herein, came to be allowed. Similarly, by the said order, the Writ
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 961
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Ltd. v.
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association & Anr.
Petition No.31808/2003 filed by Respondent No.1 was also allowed
and the Writ Petition No.7993/2006 filed by M/s Divgi Metal Wares
Ltd., the appellant herein, came to be dismissed.
2. The facts leading to the filing of the present appeals are as under:-
2.1 The appellant is a company which manufactures automobile
gears at two factories, one in Pune, Maharashtra and the other
at Sirsi, Karnataka. The Respondent No.1 is a Trade Union
registered under the provisions of the Indian Trade Unions Act,
1926. The relations between the appellant and the respondents
are governed by the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders)
Act, 1946 (for short, ‘the said Act’). It is also not in dispute
that, it was at the instance of the employer that the Deputy
Labour Commissioner and Certifying Officer passed an order
on 03.07.1989 thereby certifying the Standing Order. Clause
20 of the Standing Orders reads thus:-
“20. Transfers: An employee shall be liable to be
transferred at any time from the unit/factory/office/
establishment of the company located anywhere
in India or from one department to another within
the same unit/factory/office/establishment or from
one job of similar nature and capacity to another
job of same nature and capacity from one job to
another similar job or from one shift to another
shift, provided such a transfer does not affect his
normal wages. Any refusal to accept a transfer as
above will be treated as mis-conduct as per Rule
31.2.1949.”
2.2 It will also be relevant to refer to Clause 31 of the Certified
Standing Order. It reads thus:
“Nothing contained in these standing Orders shall
operate in derogation of any law for the time being in
force or to the prejudice of any right under a contract of
service, custom or usage, or an agreement settlement
or award applicable to the establishment.”
2.3 It is also not in dispute that Clause 5 of every letter of appointment
and Clause 1 of every letter of confirmation in service issued
to the workmen contains the following stipulation:-
962 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
“Your services are transferable at short notice to
any department or any works, offices belonging to
the Company. In the event of transfer the terms and
conditions stipulated in this letter shall continue to
apply, and you will be governed by the rules and
regulations of the establishment where your services
are transferred.”
2.4 The appeal challenging the Certified Standing Order dated
03.07.1989 came to be filed before the learned Industrial
Tribunal which rejected the appeal as time barred vide order
dated 06.04.1996. Indisputably, the same order has not been
carried forward.
2.5 In the months of April to September, 1998 on account of reduction
in orders and lack of sufficient work, 66 workmen from the Sirsi
Factory were transferred to Pune Factory. All the workmen were
paid in advance for one week’s leave with pay @ Rs.1,000/-
towards travel expenses. Though the employees collected the
said amount, they did not report at the Pune Factory.
2.6 These workmen, whose services were transferred raised
Industrial Disputes vide Nos.42/1998, 2/1999 and 3/1999.
2.7 On the application of the respondent, the Deputy Labour
Commissioner and Certifying Officer modified the Certified
Standing Orders and deleted the following words from Clause
1 on 30.09.1999:-
“from the unit/factory/office/establishment in which he is
working to any other unit/factory /office/establishment
of the Company located anywhere in India, or”
2.8 The said deletion came to be challenged by way of an appeal
by the appellant before the learned Industrial Tribunal. The
learned Industrial Tribunal by the judgment and order dated
03.03.2001 partly allowed the appeal and set aside the
modifications to the Standing Order of 3rd July, 1989. The
same came to be challenged by the respondent by way of Writ
Petition No.44810/2001.
2.9 In the meanwhile, the learned Industrial Tribunal, Hubli vide its
common award, rejected the aforesaid three references, viz.,
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 963
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Ltd. v.
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association & Anr.
ID Nos. 2/1999, 3/1999 and 42/1998 filed by the workmen on
30.05.2002. The Tribunal also held that the transfers were not
malafide. A Writ Petition No.31808/2003 was filed before the
High Court by the respondents challenging the said award
dated 30.05.2002.
2.10 In parallel proceedings, 03 workmen who were similarly
transferred on 08.02.1999 raised Reference ID no.220/2001 and
16 workmen who had been earlier transferred on 27.04.1998
raised the Reference ID No.9/2002.
2.11 These references were allowed by the learned Industrial Tribunal
at Hubli vide award dated 28.02.2006 leading to filing of Writ
Petition No.7993/2006 by the present appellant before the
learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court.
2.12 In the meanwhile, the learned Single Judge dismissed the Writ
Petition No.44810/2001 filed by the respondents vide order
dated 20.03.2006, which led to filing of Writ Appeal No.877/2006
before the Division Bench of the High Court. The learned
Judges of the Division Bench, while hearing the appeal, also
called for the papers of the aforesaid two writ petitions which
were pending before the learned Single Judge and passed the
order as aforesaid.
3. We have heard Shri C.U. Singh, learned senior counsel for the
appellant and Shri S.G. Hasnen, learned senior counsel appearing
for the respondents.
4. Shri C.U. Singh submits that, the reasoning of the Division Bench
to the effect that since the Schedule of the said Act does not
contain provisions with regard to transfer and therefore the 1999
amendment itself was not tenable is without substance. He further
submits that, as per Section 3 of the said Act, though for every item
in the Schedule a provision has to be made in the Standing Order,
there is no restriction for providing of additional items. He further
submits that, in view of provisions of Section 7 read with Section
10(3), the modified Standing Order would have taken effect only
after the period of seven days from the date on which the copies of
the order of the Appellate Authority are sent to the employer and to
the trade union or other prescribed representatives of the workmen
under sub-Section (2) of Section 6 of the said Act. It is submitted
964 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
that the 1999 modification was challenged by way of an appeal and
the said appeal was dismissed. The writ petition challenging the said
appellate order was also dismissed and therefore during the period in
which the transfers were made, it was the Standing Orders certified
on 03.07.1989, which were in vogue.
5. Shri Singh further submits that, even if the words from Clause 20
as were directed to be deleted by the amendment of 30.09.1999;
still, in view of the law laid down by this Court in the case of Cipla
Ltd. vs Jayakumar R. and Another1, the transfer of workmen from
Sirsi Factory to Pune Factory could not be interfered.
6. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the contrary submits that,
learned Judges of the Division Bench have rightly held that there
was no power to provide stipulation for transfer in the Standing Order
and therefore, the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court has
rightly held the 1999 amendment to be unsustainable.
7. We find that, for deciding the present appeal, it would not be necessary
for us to address the first two issues raised by Shri C.U. Singh,
inasmuch as, even for the sake of argument if it is accepted that
the words directed to be deleted by the amendment of 30.09.1999
are deleted from Clause 20, still in view of the law laid down by this
Court in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra) the transfers could not have
been held to be invalid.
8. It will be relevant to refer to paragraph 3 of the judgment of this
Court in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra), which refers to Clause 3
and Clause 11 of the terms of appointment. It reads thus:
“3. Briefly stated the facts are that the respondent was
appointed as a mechanic by a letter of appointment dated
31-1-1983 in the appellant›s establishment at Bangalore.
Two of the terms of appointment which are relevant for
the purposes of the present case namely clause 3 and
clause 11 are as follows:
Clause 3:
You will be in full time employment with the
Company. You are required to work at the
1 (1999) 1 SCC 300
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 965
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Ltd. v.
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association & Anr.
Company’s establishment at Bangalore or at any
of its establishments in India as the Company
may direct without being entitled to any extra
remuneration. You shall have to carry out such
duties as are assigned to you, diligently and
during such hours as may be stipulated by the
management from time to time. While you are
in service, you shall not be employed elsewhere
or have any interest in any trade or business.
Clause 11:
You will be governed by the Standing Orders
applicable for workmen of the Company, a copy
of which is attached for your reference.”
9. It will also be relevant to refer to paragraph 9 of the judgment of
this Court in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra), wherein the argument
on behalf of the employee and the relevant clause in the Standing
Order applicable to the parties have been reproduced. It reads thus:
“9. It was vehemently contended by the learned counsel for
the respondent that notwithstanding the aforesaid clause
3 in the letter of appointment the position in law is that if
there is any clause which is in conflict with the Standing
Orders then the Standing Orders must prevail. It was
submitted that clause 11 of the letter of appointment clearly
stipulated that the Standing Orders would be applicable.
The learned counsel drew our attention to the relevant
clause in the Standing Orders which reads as follows:
“A workman may be transferred from one
department to another, or from one section
to another or from one shift to another within
factory/Agricultural Research Farm, provided
such transfers do not involve a reduction in his
emoluments and grade. Worker who refuses
such transfers are liable to be discharged.”
10. In the said case, it was sought to be argued on behalf of the
employees that when the Standing Order talks of transfer, it permits
the transfer only in terms of the said clause and transfer de hors
the same was not permissible. The argument was accepted by the
966 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High
Court. While reversing the order of the learned Single Judge this
Court observed thus:-
“12. In our opinion, the aforesaid construction does not
flow from the provisions of the Standing Orders when read
along with the letter of appointment and, therefore, the
conclusion arrived at by the High Court was not correct.
As has already been noticed the letter of appointment
contains both the terms namely for the respondent being
transferable from Bangalore as well as with regard to
the applicability of the Standing Orders. These clauses,
namely, Clauses 3 and 11 have to be read along with the
Standing Orders, the relevant portion of which has been
quoted hereinabove. Reading the three together we do
not find that there is any conflict as has been sought to
be canvassed by the learned Counsel for the respondent.
Whereas the Standing Orders provide for the department
wherein a workman may be asked to work within the
establishment itself at Bangalore, Clause 3 of the letter
of appointment, on the other hand, gives the right to the
appellant to transfer a workman from the establishment at
Bangalore to any other establishment of the Company in
India. Therefore, as long as the respondent was serving
at Bangalore he could be transferred from one department
to another only in accordance with the provisions of the
Standing Orders but the Standing Orders do not in any
way refer to or prohibit the transfer of a workman from
one establishment of the appellant to another. There is
thus no conflict between the said clauses.”
11. It could thus be seen that, this Court has clearly held that, when
Clauses 3 and 11 of the appointment order are read alongwith the
Standing Order, there is no conflict as was sought to be canvassed
by the employee. It has been held that, whereas the Standing
Orders provided for the department wherein a workman may be
asked to work within the establishment itself in Bangalore, Clause
3 of the letter of appointment, on the other hand, gives the right
to the employer to transfer a workman from the establishment at
Bangalore to any other establishment of the Company in India. It
has been held that the Standing Order does not in any way refer
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 967
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Ltd. v.
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association & Anr.
to or prohibit the transfer of a workman from one establishment of
the appellant to another and thus, there is no conflict between the
said clauses.
12. The terms of appointment, which fell for consideration of this Court
in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra) are almost similar to the terms of
the appointment in the appointment order as well as the confirmation
order in the present case. They clearly stipulate that the services
are transferable to any department or any work offices belonging
to the company. It is further clarified that; upon transfer, the terms
and conditions stipulated in the appointment order would continue
to apply and the employees would be governed by the rules and
regulations of the employment where his/her services are transferred.
13. Even for a moment if it is accepted that the reasoning of the Division
Bench that the amendment to clause 20 of the Standing Order by
order dated 30.09.1999 is not permissible; still, in view of the law laid
down by this Court in the case of Cipla Ltd. (supra), it would make
no difference. If the reasoning of the Division Bench is accepted,
Clause 20 would read as under:-
“20. Transfers: An employee shall be liable to be transferred
at any time from one department to another within the
same unit/factory/office/establishment or from one job of
similar nature and capacity to another job of same nature
and capacity from one job to another similar job or from
one shift to another shift, provided such a transfer does
not affect his normal wages. Any refusal to accept a
transfer as above will be treated as mis-conduct as per
Rule 31.2.1949.”
14. If that be so, the clause in the Standing Order would be similar with
the clause that fell for consideration before this Court in the case of
Cipla Ltd. (supra), and as such, there would be no conflict between
the Standing Order and the terms and conditions as stipulated in the
order of appointment/confirmation. Whereas the Standing Order would
cover the transfer from one department to another within the same
unit/factory/office/establishment or from one job of similar nature and
capacity to another job of same nature and capacity and also from
one job to another similar job or from one shift to another shift. Per
contra, the terms of appointment and confirmation would permit the
transfer of an employee to any department or any works or offices
968 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
belonging to the company. Another aspect that needs to be taken into
consideration is that clause 31 of the Schedule of the Standing Order,
which is reproduced herein above specifically provides that nothing
contained in the Standing Order shall operate in derogation of any
law for the time being in force or cause prejudice to any right under
contract of service, custom or usage or an agreement, settlement or
award applicable to the establishment. It can thus be seen that nothing
contained in the Standing Orders can operate in derogation or to the
prejudice of the provisions as provided in the contract of service.
15. In this view of the matter, we find that the Division Bench has erred
in allowing the writ petition of the respondents, thereby holding the
transfers to be illegal. Similarly, the learned Division Bench also
erred in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants herein,
which was filed challenging the award dated 28.02.2006. It is to be
noted that the said award was totally contrary to the earlier award
passed by the very same Tribunal on 30.05.2001.
16. For the aforesaid reasons, we find that the impugned judgment
and order is not sustainable. However, we clarify that we have not
considered the larger issue with regard to power of modification
of the standing order and leave it open to be adjudicated in an
appropriate proceeding. We find that the learned Division Bench
was in error in calling the writ petitions filed by the appellant as well
as the respondent(s) and deciding them without even discussing
the reasonings as were adopted by the learned Tribunal. It is to be
noted that, in the first order dated 30.05.2002, the learned Industrial
Tribunal apart from holding that in view of Clause 20 and in terms of
appointment and confirmation orders, the challenge to the transfer
orders was not sustainable, also after discussing the entire material
on record, found that the transfers were not mala fide.
17. The award dated 28.02.2006 only considers that Clause 20 stood
modified on 30.09.1999 and as such the transfer orders were not
permissible. However, the award passed in 2006 fails to take into
consideration that on 03.03.2001, the appeal against the modification
was partly allowed by the learned Industrial Tribunal setting aside
the order dated 30.09.1999.
18. It will be relevant to refer to Section 7 of the said Act. It reads thus:
“7. Date of operation of standing orders.- Standing
orders shall, unless an appeal is preferred under Section
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 969
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Ltd. v.
M/s. Divgi Metal Wares Employees Association & Anr.
6, come into operation on the expiry of thirty days
from the date on which authenticated copies thereof
are sent under sub-section (3) of Section 5, or where
an appeal as aforesaid is preferred, on the expiry of
seven days from the date on which copies of the order
of the appellate authority are sent under sub-section
(2) of Section 6”
19. It could thus be seen that, in view of the provisions of Section 7, the
Standing Orders shall come into operation on the expiry of 30 days
from the date on which the authenticated copies thereof are sent
under sub-section (3) or Section 5. However, where an appeal, as
provided under sub-section (2) of Section 6 is preferred, the same
would come into operation only upon the expiry of seven days from
the date on which copies of the order of the appellate authority
are sent. Section 10 of the said Act deals with the duration and
modification of standing orders.
20. It will also be relevant to refer to sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the
said Act, which reads thus:
“10. Duration and modification of standing orders.-
(3) The foregoing provisions of this Act shall apply in respect
of an application under sub-section (2) as they apply to
the certification of the first standing orders.”
21. It could be seen from the perusal thereof that all foregoing provisions
including the provision in Section 7 of the said Act would also apply
in respect of the application under sub-section (2) as they apply
to certification of the first Standing Order. As such, in view of the
order dated 03.03.2001 passed by the learned Industrial Tribunal,
the amendment made in the year 1999 had not come into effect in
view of the appeal being allowed by the learned Tribunal.
22. We therefore find that, on the date of the orders of transfer as well as
the date on which the learned Industrial Tribunal passed the award
dated 28.02.2006, it is the 03.07.1989 Standing Order which would
be in operation. More so when the appeal challenging the same by
the respondents came to be dismissed on 06.04.1996 and which
order was not carried further by the respondents.
23. We further find that the learned Division Bench has also erred in
not taking into consideration the law laid down by this Court in the
970 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
case of Cipla Ltd. (supra) though the said judgment was specifically
cited before it.
24. In the result, the impugned judgment and order is quashed and set
aside. Writ Appeal No. 877 of 2006 filed by the respondent No.1
is dismissed. The order dated 20.03.2006 passed by the learned
single judge in Writ Petition No. 44810 of 2001 is upheld. Writ
Petition No.31808/2003 filed by the respondent No.1 is dismissed.
Writ Petition No.7993/2006 filed by the appellant is allowed. The
order passed by the learned Tribunal dated 28.02.2006 is quashed
and set aside. However, we clarify that we have not considered the
larger issue with regard to the powers of the Certifying Officer to
provide a clause in the Standing Orders, reserving the power of the
employer to transfer its employees anywhere in India.
25. In our view, in view of the law laid down by this Court in the case of
Cipla Ltd. (supra), it was not necessary for the Division Bench to
go into the said issue, inasmuch as the facts of the case at hand,
are squarely covered by Cipla Ltd. (supra).
26. The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. There shall be
no orders as to costs.
27. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

cross-objection filed by the plaintiffs were rejected – Plea of the
plaintiffs inter alia that the judgment of the High Court is liable
to be set aside on the ground that no points for determination
were framed therein, as required by Or. 41, r.31 CPC:
Held: Mere omission to frame the points for determination would
not vitiate the judgment of the first appellate Court, provided that
the first appellate Court recorded its reasons based on the evidence
adduced by both parties – Thus, even if the first appellate Court
does not separately frame the points for determination arising in the
first appeal, it would not prove fatal as long as that Court deals with
all the issues that actually arise for deliberation in the said appeal –
Substantial compliance with the mandate of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC in
that regard is sufficient – High Court did set out all the issues framed
by the Trial Court in the body of the judgment and was, therefore,
fully conscious of all the points that it had to consider in the appeal –
Further, no particular issue that was considered by the Trial Court
was left out by the High Court while adjudicating the appeal – No
merit in the contention that the impugned judgment is liable to be
set aside on this preliminary ground, warranting reconsideration of
the first appeal by the High Court afresh – Furthermore, on merits,
plaintiffs, being well aware of the fact that Final Plot No. 187 allotted
to them under the second varied Town Planning Scheme, was of
lesser area, accepted the same without any protest and without
agitating a right to a larger area in the light of the initial allotment
of Plot No.463, and their conduct in depositing ₹24,350/- thereafter,
implying receipt of the compensation amount for the shortfall area
of 974 sq. mts. @ 25/- per sq. mt., foreclosed their right, if any, to
either challenge the allotment of a plot of lesser area or to seek
more compensation – Further, upon the preparation or variation
of a Town Planning Scheme, the rights in the earlier plots of land
would stand extinguished – Thus, such rights, if any, which became
extinct cannot be the basis for a later cause of action – Also, the
quantification of compensation @ 25/- per sq. mt. for the shortfall
area of 974 sq. mts., which is relatable to the power of the Town
Planning Officer u/s.52(3)(x), was a decision which was amenable
to appellate review u/s.54 however, admittedly the plaintiffs did not
avail such remedy – Plaintiffs’ claim for damages/compensation
was also not supported by material evidence – Further, as there
was never any guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his
land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any
land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs cannot assert
596 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
any vested right in that regard – High Court justified in allowing the
first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs
in entirety – Impugned judgment not interfered with. [Paras 29-31,
34, 35, 39, 41 and 42]
Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 –
ss.70, 71 – Plaintiffs argued that variation of the Town Planning
Scheme as permitted u/ss.70 and 71 must be read together:
Held: No merit in this submission – Section 70 deals with the power
to vary a Town Planning Scheme on the ground of error, irregularity
or informality while Section 71 is general in nature and states that,
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 70, a Town Planning
Scheme may at any time be varied by a subsequent scheme made,
published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the Act
of 1976 – The very fact that Section 71 begins with a non-obstante
clause referring to Section 70, manifests that the power thereunder
is not fettered in any manner, unlike the power under Section 70
which can only be exercised on the grounds of error, irregularity or
informality – Further, Section 71 postulates that the variation of the
Town Planning Scheme is to be made, published and sanctioned
in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976, which would
mean that the entire exercise would be undertaken afresh upon
such variation, including reconstitution of the plots under Section
45 – Therefore, further reduction of a plot notified in the original
Town Planning Scheme is implicit in the general power of variation
vesting in the authority under Section 71 of the Act of 1976. [Para 37]

Discussed.
Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 –
s.45 – Reconstitution of plots – Plaintiffs contended that the
1976 Act does not contemplate a second reduction in the
reconstituted plot area:
Held: Said argument does not merit acceptance – Section 45 deals
with reconstitution of plots – A plot owner who has surrendered his
original land for the purposes of the Town Planning Scheme is not
even assured of allotment of a reconstituted plot in lieu thereof – In
such an event, he is entitled only to compensation – Therefore, there
is no guaranteed right vesting in a plot owner who surrendered his
land in accordance with the Town Planning Scheme that he would
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 597
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.

be allotted another plot of land in lieu thereof, much less, a plot
of the same area – It is an admitted fact that, when the plaintiffs’
father surrendered an extent of 19823 sq. yds./16575 sq. mts., he
was allotted a lesser extent of 15576 sq. yds./13023 sq. mts in two
plots in the original Town Planning Scheme, with a deduction of
21.40% – As there was never any guarantee that a plot owner who
surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would
be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs
cannot assert any vested right in that regard. [Paras 38, 41]

Sanjay Kumar, J.
1. These two appeals arise out of the common judgment dated
18.06.2013 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat
at Ahmedabad in First Appeal No. 3596 of 2009 and Cross-Objection
No. 81 of 2010 in First Appeal No. 3596 of 2009. Thereby, the Division
Bench allowed the first appeal filed by the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation (for brevity, ‘the Corporation’) and dismissed the cross-
objection filed by the respondents in the first appeal. Aggrieved
thereby, the said respondents filed these appeals.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 599
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
2. The Corporation filed the aforestated first appeal challenging the
judgment and decree dated 17.12.2008 passed by a learned Judge of
the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, in Civil Suit No. 4583 of 1998. The
said suit was filed by the appellants herein against the Corporation
seeking compensation of ₹1,63,97,673/- with interest thereon @
18% p.a. or, in the alternative, allotment of land, i.e., an extent of
974 sq. mts., in any Town Planning Scheme in the western zone of
Ahmedabad.
3. The suit averments of the appellants (hereinafter, referred to as ‘the
plaintiffs’) were as follows: The plaintiffs’ father was the owner of
original Plot Nos. 144, 150/P and 151/P in Survey Nos. 155, 209
and 210/P respectively, admeasuring 19823 sq. yds./16575 sq. mts.
While so, the Corporation prepared Town Planning Scheme No.6,
Paldi, under the provisions of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban
Development Act, 1976 (for brevity, ‘the Act of 1976’). The scheme
came into force from 01.08.1963, whereupon the plaintiffs’ father was
required to contribute 21.40% of his lands, i.e., 4247 sq. yds./3552
sq. mts., to the Corporation for public purposes. For the remaining
extent of 15576 sq. yds./13023 sq. mts., the Corporation allotted two
separate final plots, viz., Final Plot No. 478, admeasuring 11686 sq.
yds./9771 sq. mts., and Final Plot No. 463, admeasuring 3890 sq.
yds./3252 sq. mts. The vacant possession of Final Plot No. 478 was
delivered to the plaintiffs’ father but the Corporation failed to deliver
possession of Final Plot No. 463 owing to its occupation by slum
dwellers. Town Planning Scheme No. 6 was varied thereafter in 1983
but without any alternative plot being allotted in lieu of Final Plot No.
463. The Corporation then prepared a second varied scheme in the
year 1986, viz., Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi (second varied),
which came into force on 26.04.1991. Thereunder, Final Plot No. 463
was taken back for the purpose of slum upgradation and the plaintiffs
were offered Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2724 sq. yds./2278 sq.
mts. In effect, the land allotment in their favour was reduced by 974
sq. mts., when compared with the area of the initially allotted plot.
The plaintiffs claimed that they were offered meagre compensation
@ ₹25/- per sq. mt. for the deducted area of 974 sq. mts, though
the value of the land in 1991 was about ₹6000/- per sq. mt. in Paldi
area. Even after the second variation of the scheme, in which Final
Plot No. 187 was allotted to them, the Corporation failed to give
vacant possession thereof, due to litigation between the Corporation
600 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and the occupant of the said plot. Ultimately, the Corporation was
able to handover possession of Final Plot No. 187 to them only on
31.01.1996, after the litigation came to an end. Thus, from 01.08.1963,
the date on which Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi (Principal
Scheme), came into force, the plaintiffs were deprived of possession
and enjoyment of 3890 sq. yds. of land, as was promised initially, as
the Corporation was not in a position to allot the said land to them
and on 31.01.1996, they were finally delivered possession of Final
Plot No. 187 admeasuring only 2278 sq. mts. The compensation
awarded to them for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq.
mt. was an eye wash in view of the prevailing prices of land in Paldi
area in the year 1991. The plaintiffs stated that they were, therefore,
constrained to sue for compensation for the damages suffered by
them due to the failure of the Corporation in discharging its duties
under the Act of 1976.
4. Further, the plaintiffs pointed out that, in Town Planning Scheme No.
6, Final Plot No. 187 was reserved for construction of a school but
the Corporation permitted one Pulkit Trust to use it as a playground
in 1970. In the first variation of the scheme, Final Plot No. 187 was
reserved for a Civic Centre. Litigation cropped up between Pulkit
Trust and the Corporation and during the pendency thereof, the
Corporation prepared the second varied scheme, whereby the plaintiffs
were allotted Final Plot No. 187 though it was still in the occupation
of Pulkit Trust. The Corporation issued Notice dated 27.04.1992
under Section 68 of the Act of 1976 proposing to evict Pulkit Trust
from the land. After considering the objections raised by Pulkit Trust,
the Corporation informed it on 27.09.1994 that the same were not
accepted. Thereupon, Pulkit Trust filed Civil Suit No. 5415 of 1994,
which ultimately culminated with the dismissal of the SLP filed by it
before this Court in 1995.
5. The plaintiffs further stated that, in the meantime, a public interest
litigation was instituted before the High Court of Gujarat vide Special
Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992. The plaintiffs also joined the litigation
thereafter as necessary parties. This case was finally dismissed by
the High Court on 3/4.04.1995. The plaintiffs stated that they had
suffered huge monetary losses as they were deprived of the benefit of
enjoying the property since 1963 and the failure of the Corporation in
allotting them suitable land, at the time the scheme was implemented,
amounted to failure in discharge of its statutory obligation and duty
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 601
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
under Sections 65, 68, 84 and 85 of the Act of 1976. The plaintiffs
claimed that the market rate of the land allotted to the plaintiffs was
about ₹150/- per sq. yd. in the year 1963 and, therefore, the value of
3890 sq. yds. would come to ₹5,83,500/-. They asserted that if this
amount had been invested at 10% p.a. compound rate of interest,
it would come to ₹1,63,97,673/-. They prayed for compensation of
₹1,63,97,673/-. They further stated that, the scheme was framed as
per the provisions of the Act of 1976, whereby deduction of 21.40%
of their land was necessitated, but they were finally allotted land with
a further deduction of 974 sq. mts. illegally. They, therefore, sought
allotment of that land in the alternative.
6. The Corporation filed its written statement in the suit, stating as under:
The suit, as framed, was not maintainable and the Civil Court had
no jurisdiction to entertain it and grant the reliefs prayed for therein.
The suit also required to be dismissed for non-joinder of parties, as
the State Government had not been impleaded therein. Even on
merits, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs prayed for. The
plaintiffs were allotted Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2278 sq.
mts., under the scheme, which had been varied after following the
due procedure. As regards the shortfall of land, the plaintiffs were
paid compensation @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. under the scheme itself and,
as such, the plaintiffs accepted possession of Final Plot No. 187 and
the compensation, in respect of the remaining area of land, without
protest and without challenging the same. Therefore, it was not open
to them to make out a grievance either with respect to the remaining
area of land and/or the quantum of compensation. If they had any
grievance with respect to the quantum of compensation, they were
required to prefer an appeal under Section 54 of the Act of 1976.
Further, the plaintiffs could not pray for compensation for the extent
of 974 sq. mts. on the basis of the original Town Planning Scheme
No. 6, Paldi, as upon variation of the scheme, the original scheme
ceased to be in existence and stood substituted by the varied scheme
under Section 71 of the Act of 1976. The Corporation, accordingly,
prayed for dismissal of the suit.
7. On the basis of the aforesaid pleadings, the Trial Court framed the
following issues for consideration: -
‘1) Whether the plaintiff proves that deceased father was
the original owner of land bearing S. Nos. 255, 209
602 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and 210/P (original plot Nos. 144, 150/P and 151/P)
admeasuring 19823 sq. yards in Paldi area?
2) Whether the plaintiff proves that they required to be
allotted 155/6 sq. yards by Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation due to enforcement of Town Planning
Scheme?
3) Whether the plaintiff proves that one final plot was
allotted on the original plot itself and another final plot
admeasuring about 3890 sq. yards bearing S. No. 403
was allotted to other side?
4) Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendant failed
perform its legal obligation to give vacant and peaceful
possession of Final Plot No. 463 due to alleged
reasons?
5) Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendant offered
Final Plot No. 187 admeasuring 2278 sq. mts.?
6) Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendant offered
a meagre compensation for the deducted area of 972
sq. meter. Even though the real value of the land in
1991 was about Rs. 6000/- per sq. meter, in Paldi area?
7) Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendant handed
over and allotted the possession of Final Plot No. 187
on dt. 3196 after litigation as alleged in the plaint?
8) Whether the plaintiff proves that the compensation
awarded, for the difference of 974 sq. meter. At the
rate of Rs. 25 per sq. meter, was merely an eye wash
in view of the prevailing prices of land in Paldi area
in the year 1991?
9) Whether the plaintiff proves that as alleged plots
handed over to him on different dates, so he suffered
huge monetary loss and deprived of benefit on
enjoyment of their property since 1963?
10) Whether the plaintiff proves that the prevailing market
rate of the allotted land to them was about Rs. 150/-
per sq. yard in 1963? And value of 3890 sq. yards
land would come to Rs. 5,83,500?
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 603
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
11) Whether the plaintiffs prove that they are entitled to
the interest at the rate of 10% p.a. on Rs. 5,83,500/-
which have turned out in investment at compound rate
of interest comes to Rs. 1,63,97,673/- as alleged?
11A) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to be allotted remaining
land of 974 sq. meter by the defendant as prayed for
in para 10(A) of plaint?
12) Whether the defendant proves that the suit is bad and
illegal for non-joinder of necessary parties as alleged?
13) Whether the defendant proves that the suit is not
maintainable as alleged?
14) Whether the defendant proves that the plaintiff had not
raised any objection at the proper time as alleged?
15) Whether the defendant proves that the plaintiff is not
entitled to any special notice as alleged?
16) Whether the defendant proves that in plaintiff’s case
they followed all the necessary procedure as alleged?
17) Whether the defendant proves that this Court has no
jurisdiction to try this suit?
18) What order and what decree?’
8. After considering the evidence, oral and documentary, and
the arguments of both sides, the Trial Court answered Issue
Nos. 1,2,3,4,5,7, 8,9 and 11A in the affirmative and Issue Nos.
6,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 and 17 in the negative. Significantly, the
Corporation adduced no oral or documentary evidence. As regards
Issue Nos. 4 and 5, pertaining to the offer and allotment of Final
Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2278 sq. mts., the Trial Court noted that
Resolution dated 15.10.1986 was passed by the Town Planning
Committee, in which it was stated that in the place of Final Plot No.
463, it was advised that the same area in Final Plot No. 187 is to
be allotted. The Trial Court also noted the Resolution passed by the
Corporation on 30.10.1986 that the plaintiffs would be allotted the
same area of land which was earlier allotted in Final Plot No. 463.
The Trial Court further noted the correspondence thereafter, which
reflected that Final Plot No. 187 was being allotted to the plaintiffs
and that the change of allotment of plots resulted in a reduction of
604 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
974 sq. mts. of land. The Trial Court accordingly answered Issue
Nos. 4 and 5 in the affirmative. As regards Issue No. 6, pertaining
to the compensation for the reduced area of 974 sq. mts., the Trial
Court noted that though the plaintiffs pleaded that, in the year
1991 the value of the land in Paldi area was about ₹6000/- per
sq. mt., they did not produce a single document or corroborative
evidence to prove that fact. The issue was, therefore, answered
in the negative.
9. As regards Issue Nos. 8 and 9 as to whether the compensation @
₹25/- per sq. mt. was merely an eye wash and whether the plaintiffs
suffered huge monetary losses, the Trial Court noted that Final Plot
No. 187 had been allotted to the plaintiffs in the place of Final Plot
No. 463, which was initially allotted to them in the year 1963 and for
which the rate was shown as ₹25/- per sq. mt. The Trial Court noted
that 33 years after the allotment of Final Plot No. 463, Final Plot No.
187 was handed over to the plaintiffs in January, 1996, and the same
rate of ₹25/- per sq. mt. was adopted for the compensation. The
Trial Court, accordingly, agreed with the plaintiffs that the said rate
was meagre and, therefore, the compensation offered at that rate
was merely an eye wash. As Final Plot No. 187 was handed over
to the plaintiffs 33 years after the allotment of the first plot and as
Paldi area could be considered a posh area, the Trial Court affirmed
that the plaintiffs had suffered monetary loss by the deprivation of
the benefit of enjoying the property since 1963. Issue Nos. 8 and
9 were accordingly answered in the affirmative.
10. As the plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence in support of their claim
as to the market value of the land but as they had proved that the
Corporation failed to allot the remaining extent of 974 sq. mts. due
to total negligence, they were held entitled to get that extent of land.
Issue Nos. 10 and 11 were answered in the negative but Issue No.
11A was answered in the affirmative. Issue No. 12, pertaining to the
maintainability of the suit, was answered in favour of the plaintiffs
and in the negative.
11. Issue Nos. 13,14,15,16 and 17 were taken up together and the Trial
Court answered all of them also in the negative. As regards the bar
under Section 105 of the Act of 1976, the Trial Court opined that this
provision was not intended to protect injustice caused to the parties
and as the Corporation had failed to provide the second final plot till
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 605
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
the year 1996 and the same was given with a short fall in area and
with meagre compensation therefor, the said actions were not in good
faith and the statutory provision would not protect the Corporation.
12. The Trial Court, accordingly, decreed the suit by accepting the
alternative prayer made by the plaintiffs that they should be allotted an
extent of 974 sq. mts. in any Town Planning Scheme in the western
zone of Ahmedabad, but rejected the main prayer for compensation
of ₹1,63,97,673/- with interest thereon. The plaintiffs were, however,
directed to repay the amount of compensation received by them @
₹25/- per sq. mt. for the extent in question.
13. Assailing the aforestated judgment and decree, the Corporation
preferred the subject first appeal before the High Court while the
plaintiffs filed their cross-objection therein, apropos the rejection of
their main prayer for compensation to the tune of ₹1,63,97,673/-.
Before doing so, the plaintiffs deposited ₹24,350/-, being the amount
awarded towards compensation for 974 sq. mts. of land @ ₹25/- per
sq. mt., as directed by the Trial Court. Thereafter, by the impugned
judgment, the High Court held in favour of the Corporation by allowing
its appeal and against the plaintiffs by rejecting their cross-objection.
14. Perusal of the impugned judgment reflects that the High Court noted
the contentions of both parties and then extracted the issues framed
by the Trial Court in extenso. The High Court, however, did not frame
the points that arose for determination in the appeal, in terms of Order
41 Rule 31 CPC. The High Court then referred to the arguments
advanced on behalf of the parties and started the discussion on
merits from para 5.1 of the judgment. The High Court observed that
compensation had been paid for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @
₹25/- per sq. mt. and noted that it was not in dispute that the said
compensation amount had been accepted without protest. The High
Court also noted that the plaintiffs had not challenged the second
varied Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, under which they were
allotted Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2278 sq. mts., in lieu of the
originally allotted Final Plot No. 463, admeasuring 3890 sq. yds. The
High Court also took note of the fact that the plaintiffs supported the
second varied scheme before the Division Bench of the High Court
in Special Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992 and concluded that they
could not make out a grievance with regard to the non-delivery of the
remaining 974 sq. mts. of land.

15. Reference was made by the High Court to Section 71 of the Act of
1976, which allowed variation of a Town Planning Scheme and it
was held that any right with respect to the remaining 974 sq. mts.,
on the basis of the original Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, no
longer remained in existence after such variation. The High Court,
accordingly, held that the Trial Court had erred in directing the
Corporation to allot 974 sq. mts. of land in any other scheme in the
western zone of Ahmedabad. The High Court also took note of the
fact that the Trial Court had opined that the compensation paid to
the plaintiffs for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. was
inadequate, which had led to the direction to the Corporation to allot
an equivalent extent of land in any other Town Planning Scheme,
while directing the plaintiffs to return the amount of compensation
paid to them. The High Court, thereupon, observed that once the
plaintiffs accepted Final Plot No. 187 and the compensation for the
974 sq. mts. of land @ ₹25/- per sq. mt. under the second varied
Town Planning Scheme, No. 6, Paldi, without protest, it was not
open to the Trial Court to pass any order which would tantamount
to further varying the scheme when it was not even challenged by
the plaintiffs.
16. As regards the inaction on the part of the Corporation in handing over
vacant possession of Final Plot No. 463, the High Court observed
that once the original Town Planning Scheme was varied, it was
not open to the plaintiffs to assert any grievance in relation to the
plot allotted to them under that scheme. As regards the inadequacy
of compensation, the High Court held that the Trial Court could not
have gone into that issue as no appeal was preferred by the plaintiffs
under Section 54 of the Act of 1976, if they were unhappy with the
quantum of compensation.
17. Insofar as the cross-objection filed by the plaintiffs is concerned, the
High Court noted that the Trial Court had not accepted their prayer
to award them compensation of ₹1,63,97,673/- as they had failed
to prove, by leading evidence, that at the relevant time in 1963 the
market price of the land was ₹150/- per sq. mt. The High Court further
held that it was not open to them to claim any damages, having
accepted the smaller plot allotted to them under the varied scheme
and the compensation for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per
sq. mt. without protest. The High Court, accordingly, concluded that
the cross-objection deserved to be dismissed. It is on this basis that
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 607
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
the High Court allowed the first appeal filed by the Corporation and
dismissed the cross-objection of the plaintiffs.
18. Before we proceed further, it would be apposite to take note of the
statutory milieu pertinent to this case and the case law relevant
thereto. Chapter 5 of the Act of 1976 is titled ‘Town Planning Schemes’
and comprises Sections 40 to 76. Section 40 deals with the making
and the contents of a Town Planning Scheme and empowers the
appropriate authority to make one or more Town Planning Scheme(s)
for a development area. Section 40(3) states that a Town Planning
Scheme may make provision for the matters enumerated in clauses
(a) to (m) thereunder. Clause (jj) therein was, however, substituted
with effect from 01.05.1999. Clause (a) refers to laying out or re-
laying out of land, either vacant or already built upon, while clause
(d) relates to the construction, alteration and removal of buildings,
bridges and other structures. Clause (e) relates to the allotment or
ear-marking of land for roads, open spaces, gardens, recreation
grounds, schools, markets, green-belts, dairies, transport facilities
and public purposes of all kinds. Section 41 requires the appropriate
authority, in consultation with the Chief Town Planner, to declare its
intention to make a Town Planning Scheme in respect of a particular
area and, within 21 days from the date of such declaration, publish
the same in the prescribed manner and dispatch a copy thereof to
the State Government, along with a plan showing the area which it
proposes to include in the Town Planning Scheme. A copy of such
plan shall be open to public inspection at the office of the appropriate
authority. Section 42 deals with the making and publication of a draft
scheme and states that, within 9 months from the date of declaration
of intention under Section 41, the appropriate authority shall make
a draft scheme of the area in respect of which the said declaration
was made and publish the same in the Official Gazette along with
the draft regulations for carrying out the provisions of the scheme.
Section 44 details the contents of the draft scheme and provides
that it should contain the particulars enumerated under Clauses (a)
to (h). Clause (a) pertains to the area, ownership and tenure of each
original plot while clause (b) relates to the particulars of land allotted
or reserved under Section 40(3)(e). Clause (c) relates to the extent
to which it is proposed to alter the boundaries of the original plot and
clause (e) requires a full description of all the details of the scheme
under Section 40(3), as may be applicable.
608 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
19. Section 45 of the Act of 1976 pertains to the reconstitution of plots and
Section 45(1) states that, in the draft scheme referred to in Section
44, the size and shape of every plot shall be determined, so far as
may be, to render it suitable for building purposes and where the plot
has already been built upon, to ensure that the building, as far as
possible, complies with the provisions of the scheme as regards open
spaces. Section 45(2) states that, for the purposes of sub-section (1),
the draft scheme may contain proposals as to the details mentioned
under clauses (a) to (e). This provision reads as under: -
‘(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the draft scheme
may contain proposals-
(a) to form a final plot by the reconstitution of an
original plot by the alteration of its boundaries,
if necessary;
(b) to form a final plot from an original plot by the
transfer of any adjoining lands;
(c) to provide with the consent of the owners that
two or more original plots which are owned by
several persons or owned by persons jointly be
held in ownership in common as a final plot, with
or without alteration of boundaries;
(d) to allot a final plot to any owner dispossessed of
land in furtherance of the scheme; and
(e) to transfer the ownership of a plot from one
person to another.’
20. Section 47 of the Act of 1976 provides for objections being raised
against the draft scheme and states that such objections are to be
made in writing within one month from the date of publication of the
draft scheme and the same should be considered by the appropriate
authority. Further, before submitting the draft scheme to the State
Government, the appropriate authority may modify the scheme as it
thinks fit. Section 48 empowers the State Government to sanction the
draft scheme. Section 50 requires the State Government to appoint a
Town Planning Officer within one month from the date on which the
draft scheme has been sanctioned and notified in the Official Gazette
and the duties of such Town Planning Officer are set out in Section
51. Thereunder, the Town Planning Officer is required, within twelve
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 609
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
months from the date of his appointment, to sub-divide the Town
Planning Scheme into a preliminary scheme and a final scheme,
following the prescribed procedure. Section 52 details the contents of
the preliminary and final schemes. Insofar as a preliminary scheme
is concerned, the Town Planning Officer is required, under Section
52(1), to give notice in the prescribed manner to the persons affected
by the scheme and define and demarcate the areas allotted to or
reserved for a public purpose or for the purpose of the appropriate
authority and the final plots. Under Section 52(1)(iii), the Town Planning
Officer is empowered to provide for the total or partial transfer of any
right in an original plot to a final plot or provide for the transfer of any
right in an original plot in accordance with the provisions of Section
81. Section 52(2) requires the Town Planning Officer to submit the
preliminary scheme so prepared to the State Government for sanction
and to, thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Government the
final scheme in accordance with the provisions of Section 52(3).
21. In the said final scheme, the Town Planning Officer is required, under
Section 52(3), to fix the difference between the total of the values
of the original plots and the total of the values of the plots included
in the scheme, in accordance with the provisions of Section 77(1)
(f). Under Clause (iii) of Section 52(3), the Town Planning Officer is
required to estimate the sums payable as compensation on each plot
used, allotted or reserved for a public purpose or for the purpose
of the appropriate authority, which is beneficial partly to owners or
residents within the area of the scheme and partly to the general
public, which shall be included in the costs of the scheme. Clauses
(iv) to (ix), thereafter, deal with the Town Planning Officer’s power
to calculate and determine the contribution to be made by the plot
owners in relation to the plots used, allotted or reserved for public
purposes or for the purpose of the appropriate authority which is
beneficial partly to the owners or residents within the area of the
scheme and partly to the general public. This would also include the
calculation of the contribution to be levied on each plot owner under
the final scheme. Section 52(3)(x) requires the Town Planning Officer
to estimate, with reference to claims made before him, after giving
due notice in the prescribed manner and form, the compensation
to be paid to the owner of any property or right injuriously affected
by the making of the Town Planning Scheme, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 82. Section 54 provides for an appeal
610 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
against any decision of the Town Planning Officer under Section
52(3)(iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), (viii) and (x) which are to be communicated
forthwith to the party concerned and such party, if aggrieved thereby,
is entitled to file an appeal within one month from the date of such
communication before the Board of Appeal, constituted under Section
55. Section 67(a) refers to the effect of a preliminary scheme and
states that, on the day on which the preliminary scheme comes into
force, all lands required by the appropriate authority shall, unless
it is otherwise determined in such scheme, vest absolutely in the
appropriate authority, free from all encumbrances. Section 67(b)
states that upon the preliminary scheme coming into force, all rights
in the original plots, which have been reconstituted into final plots,
shall determine and the final plots shall become subject to the rights
settled by the Town Planning Officer. Section 68 empowers the
appropriate authority to summarily evict any person continuing to
occupy land which he is not entitled to occupy under the preliminary
scheme, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, after such
preliminary scheme comes into force. Section 70 empowers the
appropriate authority to apply in writing to the State Government
for variation of the preliminary or final scheme after it has come into
force, if the said authority considers that the scheme is defective
on account of an error, irregularity or informality. Section 71 is titled
‘Variation of Town Planning Scheme by another scheme’. It begins
with a non-obstante clause and reads as under: -
‘71. Variation of town planning scheme by another
scheme. -Notwithstanding anything contained in Section
70, a town planning scheme may at any time be varied by
a subsequent scheme made, published and sanctioned in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.’
22. Section 81 is titled ‘Transfer of right from original to final plot or
extinction of such right’ and states that any right in an original plot
which, in the opinion of the Town Planning Officer, is capable of
being transferred wholly or in part, without prejudice to the making
of a Town Planning Scheme, to a final plot shall be so transferred
and any right in an original plot which, in the opinion of the Town
Planning Officer, is not capable of being so transferred, shall be
extinguished. Section 82 is titled ‘Compensation in respect of property
or right injuriously affected by the scheme’ and states that the owner
of any property or right which is injuriously affected by the making
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 611
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
of a Town Planning Scheme shall, if he makes a claim before the
Town Planning Officer within the prescribed time, be entitled to be
compensated in respect thereof by the appropriate authority or by
any person benefited or partly by the appropriate authority and partly
by such person, as the Town Planning Officer may in each case
determine. The proviso thereunder states that the value of such
property or right shall be deemed to be its market value on the date
of declaration of the intention to make a scheme or the date of the
notification issued by the State Government under Section 43(1)
without reference to improvements contemplated in the scheme, as
the case may be. Section 84 deals with cases in which the amount
payable to the owner exceeds the amount due from him and states
that, if the owner of an original plot is not provided with a plot in the
preliminary scheme or if the contribution to be levied on him under
Section 79 is less than the total amount to be deducted therefrom
under any of the provisions of the Act of 1976, the net amount of his
loss shall be payable to him by the appropriate authority in case or in
such other manner as may be agreed upon by the parties. Section 105
is titled ‘Bar of legal proceedings’ and states that no suit, prosecution
or other legal proceeding shall lie against the State Government, the
appropriate authority or any public servant or person duly appointed
or authorized under the Act of 1976 in respect of anything in good
faith done or purported to be done under the provisions thereof or
any rules or regulations made thereunder.
23. Section 118 of the Act of 1976 empowers the State Government to
make rules consistent with the provisions of that statute to carry out
the purposes thereof. In exercise of such power, the Gujarat Town
Planning and Urban Development Rules, 1979, were framed. Rule 16
thereof prescribes the procedure to be followed for publication of the
declaration under Section 41 of the Act of 1976. Rule 17 states that,
for the purpose of making the draft scheme under Section 42 of the
Act of 1976, the appropriate authority shall call a meeting or meetings
of the owners of the lands included in the Town Planning Scheme,
by a public notice as well as by individual notice to every owner
whose address is known to the appropriate authority, and explain in
such meeting the tentative proposals of the draft scheme for eliciting
public opinion and suggestions on the said proposals. Thereafter, the
appropriate authority is empowered to take into consideration all such
suggestions and objections raised on the proposals for making the
612 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
draft scheme under Section 42. Rule 26 details the procedure to be
followed by the Town Planning Officer under Sections 51 and 52(1)
of the Act of 1976. Rule 26(1) requires the Town Planning Officer to
give notice in Form H of the date on which he would commence his
duties for preparing the preliminary scheme and final scheme and
he shall also state the time within which the owner of any property or
right which is injuriously affected by the making of the scheme, who
would be entitled under Section 82, to make a claim for compensation
before him. Under Rule 26(4), the Town Planning Officer is required
to give every person, interested in any land affected by a scheme,
sufficient opportunity of stating their views and not give a decision till
he has duly considered their representations, if any. Rule 37 states
that a claim under Section 82 shall be made within three months from
the date fixed in the notice given under Rule 26(1).
24. Now, a quick recce of precedential thought on the Act of 1976 and
the like. In State of Gujarat vs. Shantilal Mangaldas and others1,
a Constitution Bench had occasion to consider the provisions of the
Bombay Town Planning Act, 1955. The provisions of that enactment
were earlier applicable in the State of Gujarat and are in pari materia
with those of the Act of 1976. Section 53 of the Bombay Town Planning
Act, 1955, provided that all lands required by the local authority
shall, on the day on which the final scheme comes into force, vest
absolutely in the local authority free from all encumbrances, unless
it is otherwise determined in such scheme, and that all rights in the
original plots which have been reconstituted shall determine and the
reconstituted plots shall become subject to the rights settled by the
Town Planning Officer. In effect, this provision is identical to Section
67 of the Act of 1976. The argument advanced in that case before
the High Court, which had found favour with it in holding Section 53
ultra vires, was that when a plot is reconstituted and out of that plot,
a smaller area is given to the owner and the remaining area is utilized
for a public purpose, the area so utilized vests in the local authority
but as the Act did not provide for giving compensation, which is a
just equivalent of the land expropriated on the date of extinction of
interest, the guaranteed right under Article 31(2) of the Constitution
stood infringed. Negating this contention, the Constitution Bench held
that Section 53 did not provide that a reconstituted plot is transferred
1 [1969] 3 SCR 341 : (1969) 1 SCC 509
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 613
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
or is deemed to be transferred from the local authority to the owner
of the original plot, as it provides for statutory readjustment of the
rights of the owners of the original plots of land. The Bench pointed
out that when the scheme comes into force, all rights in the original
plots stand extinguished and, simultaneously therewith, ownership
springs in the reconstituted plots. Noting that there is no vesting of
original plots in the local authority nor transfer of the rights of the
local authority in the reconstituted plots, the Bench observed that a
part or even the whole plot belonging to an owner may go to form a
reconstituted plot which may be allotted to another person or may be
appropriated to public purposes under the scheme. The Bench further
observed that the source of the power to appropriate the whole or
a part of the original plot in forming a reconstituted plot is statutory
and it does not predicate ownership of the plot in the local authority
and no process - actual or notional - of transfer is contemplated in
that appropriation. The Bench ultimately held that the concept that
lands vest in the local authority when the intention to make a scheme
is notified is against the plain intendment of the Act. Significantly,
while considering the provision in the Bombay Town Planning Act,
1955, pertaining to the method of adjustment of contribution against
compensation receivable by an owner of land, viz., Section 67, the
Bench noted that the said provision states that the difference between
the market value of the plot, with all the buildings and works thereon,
on the date of declaration of the intention to make a scheme and the
market value of the plot as reconstituted on the same day and without
reference to the improvements contemplated in the scheme, is to
be the compensation due to the owner and in the event the owner
of the original land is not allotted a plot at all, he shall be paid the
value of the original plot on the date of declaration of the intention
to make a scheme.
25. In Prakash Amichand Shah vs. State of Gujarat and others2,
another Constitution Bench again dealt with the provisions of the
Bombay Town Planning Act, 1955. It was observed therein that, on
the final scheme coming into force, the lands affected by the said
scheme which are needed by the local authority for the purposes of
the scheme automatically vest in the local authority and there is no
need to set in motion the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
2 [1985] Supp. 3 SCR 1025 : (1986) 1 SCC 581
614 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
The Bench pointed out that the Town Planning Officer is authorized
to determine whether any reconstituted plot can be given to a person
whose land is affected by the scheme, as all rights of private owners
in the original plots would determine and certain consequential rights
in favour of the owners would arise therefrom. The Bench noted that,
if reconstituted or final plots are allotted to them in the scheme, they
become owners of such final plots, subject to the rights settled by
the Town Planning Officer in the final scheme, and in some cases
the original plot of an owner might be completely allotted by the
local authority for a public purpose and such private owner may be
paid compensation or given a reconstituted plot in some other place.
Significantly, it was noted that such a reconstituted plot may be a
smaller or a bigger plot and, in some cases, it may not be possible to
allot a final plot at all. Reference was made to the provisions of the
said Act, which provided for certain financial adjustments regarding
payment of money to the local authority or to the owners of the
original plots and it was noted that the development and planning
carried out under the Act is primarily for the benefit of the public and
the local authority is under an obligation to function according to the
Act and bear a part of the expenses of the development. The Bench
observed that, in one sense, it is a package deal.
26. In Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and another vs. Ahmedabad
Green Belt Khedut Mandal and others3, a 3-Judge Bench of this
Court considered the provisions of the Act of 1976. It was observed
that the provisions of the Act of 1976, read conjointly, give a clear
picture that the Town Planning Scheme is just like consolidation
proceedings as the land belonging to various persons is first put into
a pool and then allocated for different purposes and, in such a way,
after having all deductions, the loss and profit of individual tenure-
holders is to be calculated. It was noted that a Town Planning Scheme
would provide for pooling the entire land covered by the scheme
and, thereafter, reshuffling and reconstituting of plots and the market
value of the original plots and final plots is to be assessed and the
authority has to determine as to whether a land owner has suffered
some injury or has gained from such process. It was also pointed
out that reconstitution of plots is permissible, as provided under
the scheme of the Act and as is evident from a reading of Sections
3 [2014] 11 SCR 855 : (2014) 7 SCC 357
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 615
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
45(2)(a),(b),(c) and Section 52(1)(iii), in accordance with Section 81
of the Act of 1976. The Bench observed that, if by reconstitution of
the plots, anybody suffers injury, the statutory provisions provide for
compensation under Section 67(b) read with Section 82 of the Act of
1976. It was further noted that, by such reconstitution and readjustment
of plots, there is no vesting of land in the local authority and the Act
of 1976 provides for payment of non-monetary compensation and
that mode was approved by the Constitution Bench in Shantilal
Mangaldas (supra), wherein this Court held that when the scheme
comes into force, all rights in the original plots are extinguished and,
simultaneously therewith, ownership springs in the reconstituted plots.
Reference was also made to Maneklal Chhotalal and others vs.
M.G. Makwana and others4, wherein it was observed that, even if
an original plot owner is allotted a smaller extent of land in the final
plot and has to pay certain amount as contribution, having regard to
the scheme and its objects, it is inevitable and would not amount to
deprivation. The 3-Judge Bench, accordingly, observed that it is evident
that in case a land owner is not provided with a final plot, the amount
of his loss would be payable to him as required under Section 82 of
the Act of 1976. Again referring to Shantilal Mangaldas (supra), it
was noted that there is no necessity to acquire the land as the title
of the owners is readjusted upon the scheme being sanctioned and
the lands required for any of the purposes of the scheme need not
be acquired otherwise than under the Act, for it is a settled rule of
interpretation of statutes that when power is given thereunder to do
a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way
or not at all.
27. This being the legal position vis-à-vis the Act of 1976, it was contended
before us by the plaintiffs that the impugned judgment of the High
Court is liable to be set aside on the short ground that no points for
determination were framed therein, as required by Order 41 Rule 31
CPC. Reliance was placed on Malluru Mallappa (Dead) through
Lrs. vs. Kuruvathappa and others5, wherein this Court observed
that the first appellate Court is required to set out the points for
determination, record the decision thereon and give its own reasoning.
It was further observed that, even when the said Court affirms the
4 [1967] 3 SCR 65 : AIR 1967 SC 1373
5 [2020] 2 SCR 789 : (2020) 4 SCC 313
616 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
judgment of the Trial Court, it has to comply with the requirements of
Order 41 Rule 31 CPC as non-observance thereof would lead to an
infirmity in its judgment. However, it may be noted that no absolute
proposition was laid down therein to the effect that failure to frame
points for determination, in itself, would render the first appellate
Court’s judgment invalid on that ground.
28. Reference was also made to Santosh Hazari vs. Purushottam Tiwari
(Deceased) by LRs6, wherein this Court held that a first appeal is
a valuable right and unless restricted by law, the whole case would
be open for rehearing before it, both on questions of fact and law,
and, therefore, the judgment of the first appellate Court must reflect
conscious application of mind and it must record findings supported
by reasons on all the issues arising, along with the contentions put
forth and pressed by the parties for decision of the said Court. It
was further observed that, while reversing a finding of fact, the first
appellate Court must come into close quarters with the reasoning
of the Trial Court and then assign its own reasons for arriving at a
different finding. This, per this Court, would satisfy the requirement
of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC.
29. However, in Laliteshwar Prasad Singh and others vs. S.P.
Srivastava (Dead) thru. Lrs.7, this Court, while affirming the
aforestated principles, observed that it is well settled that the mere
omission to frame the points for determination would not vitiate the
judgment of the first appellate Court, provided that the first appellate
Court recorded its reasons based on the evidence adduced by both
parties.
30. Thus, even if the first appellate Court does not separately frame the
points for determination arising in the first appeal, it would not prove
fatal as long as that Court deals with all the issues that actually
arise for deliberation in the said appeal. Substantial compliance with
the mandate of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC in that regard is sufficient.
In this regard, useful reference may be made to G. Amalorpavam
and others vs. R.C. Diocese of Madurai and others8, wherein this
Court held as under: -
6 [2001] 1 SCR 948 : (2001) 3 SCC 179
7 [2016] 11 SCR 1 : (2017) 2 SCC 415
8 [2006] 2 SCR 899 : (2006) 3 SCC 224
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 617
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
‘9. The question whether in a particular case there has
been substantial compliance with the provisions of Order
41 Rule 31 CPC has to be determined on the nature of the
judgment delivered in each case. Non-compliance with the
provisions may not vitiate the judgment and make it wholly
void, and may be ignored if there has been substantial
compliance with it and the second appellate court is in a
position to ascertain the findings of the lower appellate
court. It is no doubt desirable that the appellate court should
comply with all the requirements of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC.
But if it is possible to make out from the judgment that
there is substantial compliance with the said requirements
and that justice has not thereby suffered, that would be
sufficient. Where the appellate court has considered the
entire evidence on record and discussed the same in detail,
come to any conclusion and its findings are supported by
reasons even though the point has not been framed by
the appellate court there is substantial compliance with the
provisions of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC and the judgment is
not in any manner vitiated by the absence of a point of
determination. Where there is an honest endeavour on the
part of the lower appellate court to consider the controversy
between the parties and there is proper appraisement of
the respective cases and weighing and balancing of the
evidence, facts and the other considerations appearing on
both sides is clearly manifest by the perusal of the judgment
of the lower appellate court, it would be a valid judgment
even though it does not contain the points for determination.
The object of the rule in making it incumbent upon the
appellate court to frame points for determination and to cite
reasons for the decision is to focus attention of the court
on the rival contentions which arise for determination and
also to provide litigant parties opportunity in understanding
the ground upon which the decision is founded with a view
to enable them to know the basis of the decision and if so
considered appropriate and so advised to avail the remedy
of second appeal conferred by Section 100 CPC.’
31. As already noted hereinabove, the High Court did set out all the
issues framed by the Trial Court in the body of the judgment and
was, therefore, fully conscious of all the points that it had to consider
618 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
in the appeal. Further, we do not find that any particular issue that
was considered by the Trial Court was left out by the High Court
while adjudicating the appeal. In effect, we do not find merit in the
contention that the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside on
this preliminary ground, warranting reconsideration of the first appeal
by the High Court afresh.
32. As regards the merits of the matter, we may note that though the father
of the plaintiffs was allotted Final Plot No. 463, admeasuring 3890 sq.
yds./3252 sq. mts. in the original Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi,
in the year 1963, possession thereof could not be delivered to him as
it was occupied by slum dwellers. It was only in the second variation
of Town Planning Scheme No. 6 in August, 1986, that Final Plot No.
187 was allotted to the plaintiffs in lieu of Plot No. 463 and it had a
smaller area by 974 sq. mts. Reliance was placed by the plaintiffs
upon the resolutions passed by the Town Planning Committee in its
meeting held on 15.10.1986 and the Corporation in its general board
meeting held on 30.10.1986 respectively to contend that it was the
intention of the authorities concerned to allot the same area as in
Final Plot No. 463 to them. However, we find from the resolutions in
question that Final Plot No. 187 was specifically mentioned therein
and the intention was that this plot should be allotted to the plaintiffs.
It is an admitted fact that this final plot was part of the original Town
Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, and it was always of the same area,
i.e., 2724 sq. yds/2278 sq. mts. Therefore, the mere use of the
words ‘same area’ or ‘equal area’ in the resolutions had no impact
as those words were used in juxtaposition to Final Plot No. 187 and
the area of the said plot must have been within the knowledge of
all concerned as on the dates of the resolutions, given the statutory
scheme of transparency.
33. Further, though so much stress was laid by the plaintiffs upon the
resolutions passed by the authorities in the year 1986 to contend that
the ‘same area’ was to be allotted to them in lieu of Plot No. 463,
we may note that this mistaken impression, if at all entertained by
the plaintiffs, despite the clear mention of Final Plot No. 187 in those
resolutions and their own knowledge of the details of the scheme,
stood dispelled in April, 1995. They were parties to the public interest
litigation initiated in Special Civil Application No. 3980 of 1992 before
a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. The
challenge therein was to the allotment of Final Plot No. 187 to them
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 619
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
on the ground that the said plot was meant for a public purpose. The
plaintiffs were respondent Nos. 4 and 5 in Special Civil Application No.
3980 of 1992. In the judgment rendered therein on 03/04.04.1995,
the Division Bench observed that Final Plot No. 187 was to be given
to the plaintiffs instead of Final Plot No. 463 which was larger. The
Division Bench further observed that it was they who appeared to
have lost in the bargain, because the plot of land which was now
being offered to them, viz., Plot No. 187, was nearly 1200 sq. yds.
lesser than Plot No. 463 and the only advantage which they got was
that Plot No. 187 was free from encumbrance. Nearly nine months
later, Final Plot No. 187 was actually delivered to the plaintiffs.
However, in the interregnum, they raised no objection or grievance
as to the reduction in the plot size and quietly waited for delivery of
Final Plot No. 187. It is also an admitted fact that, shortly thereafter,
in the year 1998, the plaintiffs sold the said plot to J.K. Cooperative
Housing Society Limited.
34. The failure of the Corporation in handing over vacant possession of
Plot No. 463 was also subjected to attack, but we find that when the
said allotment was modified by the second variation of Town Planning
Scheme No. 6, Paldi, in the year 1986, whereby the plaintiffs were
allotted Final Plot No. 187 which was of a lesser area, they silently
accepted the same and did not choose to either seek implementation
of the original scheme, whereunder they were allotted a larger plot,
or challenge the varied scheme, whereby they were given a smaller
plot. Having accepted the plot allotted to them upon variation of the
scheme without demur or protest, the plaintiffs cannot now seek to
reopen the negligence and delay, if any, on the part of the Corporation
prior to such variation. Further, as is evident from the edicts laid down
by this Court, referred to supra, upon the preparation or variation
of a Town Planning Scheme, the rights in the earlier plots of land
would stand extinguished. That being so, such rights, if any, which
have become extinct cannot be the basis for a later cause of action.
35. No doubt, even in 1986, when Final Plot No. 187 was allotted to the
plaintiffs, it was not free of occupation as it had been given to Pulkit
Trust for utilization as a playground. Even if this action on the part of
the Corporation is held to be not in good faith, it would only entail a
claim for compensation or damages, but as noted by the Trial Court
as well as the High Court, the plaintiffs did not choose to adduce
any evidence in support of their claim for the quantified damages of
620 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
₹1,63,97,673/-. No document was produced by the plaintiffs in proof
of the price of land in Paldi area being ₹150/- per sq. yd. in the year
1963. Though reference was made to the decision of this Court in
Union of India and another vs. Smt. Shanti Devi and others9 in
the context of a return of 10% p.a. being anticipated from investment
in land and a multiplier of 13% being adopted for the purpose of
capitalization, this method of calculation would have had meaning
had the value of the land in the present case at the relevant point of
time been determined. However, as the plaintiffs did not adduce any
evidence whatsoever in proof of their claim as to the market value
of the land in question at the relevant point of time, this judgment
does not further their case, insofar as their claim for compensation/
damages is concerned. Reference to N. Nagendra Rao and Co. vs.
State of A.P.10, in support of the plaintiffs’ claim for compensation
owing to the negligence of the authorities is also of no avail as the
principles contained therein would have had application if the plaintiffs’
claim for damages/compensation was duly supported by material
evidence, which it is not.
36. Further, though it has been contended before us that the plaintiffs
never actually received the compensation offered by the Corporation
for the shortfall of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq. yd., it is an admitted
fact that, pursuant to the judgment and decree of the Trial Court, the
plaintiffs did deposit the sum of ₹24,350/-, being the compensation
for 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq. mt., as directed by the Trial Court.
Had it been their case that they did not receive such compensation,
they ought not to have abided by the direction of the Trial Court and
deposited that amount. This voluntary act on their part precludes
them from contending, at this stage, that the said compensation was
never paid to them and that they had deposited the amount as it was
only a paltry sum.
37. The further argument of the plaintiffs that the Act of 1976 does not
contemplate a second reduction in the reconstituted plot area does
not merit acceptance. Section 45 of the Act of 1976 deals with
reconstitution of plots and it is a settled legal position, per the decisions
of this Court in Prakash Amichand Shah and Ahmedabad Green Belt
9 [1984] 1 SCR 217 : (1983) 4 SCC 542
10 [1994] Supp. 3 SCR 144 : (1994) 6 SCC 205
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 621
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
Khedut Mandal, referred to hereinabove, that a plot owner who has
surrendered his original land for the purposes of the Town Planning
Scheme is not even assured of allotment of a reconstituted plot in
lieu thereof. In such an event, he is entitled only to compensation.
Therefore, there is no guaranteed right vesting in a plot owner who
surrendered his land in accordance with the Town Planning Scheme
that he would be allotted another plot of land in lieu thereof, much
less, a plot of the same area. It is an admitted fact that, when the
plaintiffs’ father surrendered an extent of 19823 sq. yds./16575 sq.
mts., he was allotted a lesser extent of 15576 sq. yds./13023 sq. mts
in two plots in the original Town Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, with
a deduction of 21.40%.
38. Though it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that variation
of the Town Planning Scheme as permitted under Sections 70 and
71 of the Act of 1976 must be read together, we find no merit in this
submission. Section 70 deals with the power to vary a Town Planning
Scheme on the ground of error, irregularity or informality while Section
71 is general in nature and states that, notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 70, a Town Planning Scheme may at any time
be varied by a subsequent scheme made, published and sanctioned
in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1976. The very fact
that Section 71 begins with a non-obstante clause referring to Section
70, manifests that the power thereunder is not fettered in any manner,
unlike the power under Section 70 which can only be exercised on
the grounds of error, irregularity or informality. Further, Section 71
postulates that the variation of the Town Planning Scheme is to be
made, published and sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of
the Act of 1976, which would mean that the entire exercise would be
undertaken afresh upon such variation, including reconstitution of the
plots under Section 45. Therefore, further reduction of a plot notified
in the original Town Planning Scheme is implicit in the general power
of variation vesting in the authority under Section 71 of the Act of
1976. Reference in this regard may be made to the Division Bench
judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Bhupendra Kumar Ramanlal
and others vs. State of Gujarat and others11, wherein It was held
that Section 71 of the Act of 1976 provides for the procedure laid
down in the Act of 1976 for making a Town Planning Scheme being
11 (1995) 1 GLH 1124 : (1996) AIHC 109
622 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
followed for the purpose of varying a sanctioned scheme. We are in
complete and respectful agreement with the above view expressed
by the High Court.
39. Viewed thus, we find that the plaintiffs, being well aware of the fact
that Final Plot No. 187 allotted to them under the second varied Town
Planning Scheme No. 6, Paldi, was of lesser area, accepted the same
without any protest and without agitating a right to a larger area in
the light of the initial allotment of Plot No. 463, and their conduct in
depositing ₹24,350/- thereafter, implying receipt of the compensation
amount for the shortfall area of 974 sq. mts. @ ₹25/- per sq. mt.,
foreclosed their right, if any, to either challenge the allotment of a plot
of lesser area or to seek more compensation. In this regard, we may
also note that Section 52 deals, not only with the allotment of plots,
but also the amount to be paid as compensation. Section 52(3)(x)
states that the Town Planning Officer shall estimate, with reference
to the claims made before him after notice has been given by him
in the prescribed manner and form, the compensation to be paid to
the owner of any property or right injuriously effected by the making
of the Town Planning Scheme in accordance with the provisions of
Section 82. Further, Section 54 provides an appellate remedy to
the person aggrieved by any decision of the Town Planning Officer
under Section 52(3)(x). In effect, the quantification of compensation
@ ₹25/- per sq. mt. for the shortfall area of 974 sq. mts., which is
relatable to the power of the Town Planning Officer under Section
52(3)(x), was a decision which was amenable to appellate review
under Section 54. However, it is an admitted fact that the plaintiffs
did not avail such remedy.
40. We may also note that the plaintiffs’ main prayer in their suit was for
quantified compensation, which they had calculated on the strength
of the area of Final Plot No. 463 which could not be allotted to them,
i.e., 3890 sq. yds., but their prayer, in the alternative, was for allotment
of an extent of land of 974 sq. yds., which was the shortfall in area
when they were allotted Final Plot No. 187 in the second varied
scheme. In effect, the value of 3890 sq. yds. in Final Plot No. 463
in the original Town Planning Scheme was equated by them to an
extent of 974 sq. yds. in any Town Planning Scheme in the western
zone of Ahmedabad. Significantly, no evidence was led as to the
values of the two final plots, viz., Final Plot No. 463, admeasuring
3890 sq. yds., and Final Plot No. 187, admeasuring 2724 sq. yds.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 623
Mrugendra Indravadan Mehta and Others v.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
The monetary value of these two plots would depend upon their
situation, development, proximity and access to the main road or
highway, etc., and cannot be surmised or estimated without relevant
material being produced. It cannot even be assessed as to whether
they were of equal monetary value. Therefore, the prayer of the
plaintiffs for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall
area of Final Plot No. 463 may not have been logical as their values
may not necessarily be commensurate or comparable.
41. To sum up, having sought quantified damages of ₹1,63,97,673/-, it was
incumbent upon the plaintiffs to adduce evidence in support of their
claim for this pre-determined sum. However, no evidence whatsoever
was produced by them in support of the land values relevant to any
point in time, be it of the original final plot or the final plot that was
ultimately given to them. In the absence of such crucial material, the
plaintiffs’ prayer for compensation necessarily had to be negated.
Further, as there was never any guarantee that a plot owner who
surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be
allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots, the plaintiffs cannot
assert any vested right in that regard.
42. On the above analysis, we are of the considered opinion that the
High Court was fully justified in allowing the first appeal filed by the
Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs in entirety. The impugned
judgment does not brook interference on any count.
The appeals are, therefore, bereft of merit and are accordingly
dismissed.
In the circumstances, parties shall bear their respective costs.
Result of the case: Appeals dismissed.

v.
State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
(Criminal Appeal No. 2357 of 2024)
01 May 2024
[Sanjiv Khanna* and S.V.N. Bhatti, JJ.]","Nature of chargesheets filed in some jurisdictions by the State/
Police, without stating sufficient details of the facts constituting the
offense or putting the relevant evidence on record; significance of
chargesheets for taking cognizance, summoning of the accused
etc. by the Magistrate; chargesheets and criminal proceedings
against the appellants, if to be quashed.
","Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.173 – Report of police
officer on completion of investigation – Nature and standard
of evidence in chargesheet – Chargesheet when complete:
Held: The requirement of “further evidence” or a “supplementary
chargesheet” as referred to u/s.173(8) is to make additions to
a complete chargesheet and not to make up or reparate for a
chargesheet which does not fulfil requirements of s.173(2) – The
chargesheet is complete when it refers to material and evidence
sufficient to take cognizance and for the trial – The nature and
standard of evidence to be elucidated in a chargesheet should
prima facie show that an offence is established if the material and
evidence is proven – The chargesheet is complete where a case
is not exclusively dependent on further evidence and the trial can
proceed on the basis of evidence and material placed on record
with the chargesheet – This standard is not overly technical or
fool-proof, but a pragmatic balance to protect the innocent from
harassment due to delay as well as prolonged incarceration, and yet
not curtail the right of the prosecution to forward further evidence in
support of the charges – However, chargesheet need not elaborately
evaluate the evidence, as the process of evaluation is a matter of
trial – This does not mean that the chargesheet should not disclose
or refer to the facts as to meet the requirements of s.173(2), and
the mandate of the State rules – It is the police report which would
enable the Magistrate to decide a course of action from the options

available to him – The details of the offence and investigation are
not supposed to be a comprehensive thesis of the prosecution case,
but at the same time, must reflect a thorough investigation into
the alleged offence – It is on the basis of this record that the court
can take effective cognisance of the offence and proceed to issue
process in terms of s.190(1)(b) and s.204, CrPC – Investigating
officer must make clear and complete entries of all columns in the
chargesheet so that the court can clearly understand which crime
has been committed by which accused and what is the material
evidence available on the file – Statements u/s.161 of the Code and
related documents have to be enclosed with the list of witnesses
– Role played by the accused in the crime should be separately
and clearly mentioned in the chargesheet, for each of the accused
persons – Chargesheet and summoning order quashed in Cr.A.
2357 of 2024, appellants discharged – Chargesheet in SLP (Crl.)
No.9482/2021 bereft of details and particulars, summoning order
quashed. [Paras 13, 23, 24, 31, 40, 45]
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.173(2), 190, 204, 251
– Chargesheet integral to the process of taking cognisance,
summoning of the accused, the issue of notice, framing of
charge:
Held: There is an inherent connect between the chargesheet
submitted under Section 173(2), cognisance which is taken
u/s.190, issue of process and summoning of the accused u/s.204,
and thereupon issue of notice u/s.251, or the charge in terms of
Chapter XVII of the Code – The details set out in the chargesheet
have a substantial impact on the efficacy of procedure at the
subsequent stages – The chargesheet is integral to the process
of taking cognisance, the issue of notice and framing of charge,
being the only investigative document and evidence available to
the court till that stage – Substantiated reasons and grounds for
an offence being made in the chargesheet are a key resource for
a Magistrate to evaluate whether there are sufficient grounds for
taking cognisance, initiating proceedings, and then issuing notice,
framing charges etc. – These provisions, however, have to be read
along with the power of the police to investigate under sub-section
(8) to s.173 even when they have submitted a report u/sub-section
(2) to s.173. [Para 20]
Deprecation – Of filing of chargesheets without stating
sufficient details of the facts constituting the offense or putting
the relevant evidence on record:
88 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Held: In some states, the chargesheets merely carry a reproduction
of the details mentioned by the complainant in the FIR, and then
proceed to state whether an offence is made out, or not made
out, without any elucidation on the evidence and material relied
upon – In the format prescribed for the State of Uttar Pradesh,
column 16 requires the investigating officer to state brief facts
of the case – State of Uttar Pradesh issued circular stating that
the investigation provisions contained in the Code and the police
regulations with reference to s.173, CrPC were not consistently
complied with and followed by the investigating officers and the
supervising officers – The need to provide lead details of the
offence in the chargesheet is mandatory as it is in accord with
paragraph 122 of the police regulations – Similar directions were
issued following the direction of the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad that brief narration of the material collected during
investigation, which forms the opinion of the investigating officer,
should be mentioned in the chargesheet. [Paras 2, 30]
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.190, 204 – Cognizance
of offences by Magistrates – Issue of process – “cognisance”:
Held: It indicates the juncture at which the court or Magistrate takes
judicial notice of the offence with a view to initiate proceedings
in respect of such an offence – This is different from initiation of
proceedings – Rather, it is a condition precedent to the initiation of
proceedings by a Magistrate or judge – At this stage, the Magistrate
has to keep in mind the averments in the complaint or the police
report, and has to evaluate whether there is sufficient ground for
initiation of proceedings – This is not the same as the consideration
of sufficient grounds for conviction, as whether evidence is sufficient
for supporting the conviction or not, can be determined only at the
stage of trial, and not at the stage of cognisance – s.204 does not
mandate the Magistrate to explicitly state the reasons for issue of
summons and this is not a prerequisite for deciding the validity of
the summons – Nevertheless, the requirement of the Code is that
the summons is issued when it appears to the Magistrate that there
is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused – Magistrate
in terms of s.204 is required to exercise his judicial discretion with a
degree of caution, even when he is not required to record reasons,
on whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding. [Paras 16, 17]

– Application for exemption from personal appearance was
filed which was rejected – Non-bailable warrants issued –
High Court dismissed the petition u/s.482, CrPC to quash the

Held: Non-bailable warrants cannot be issued in a routine
manner and the liberty of an individual cannot be curtailed unless
necessitated by the larger interest of public and the State – While
there are no comprehensive set of guidelines for the issuance of
non-bailable warrants, this Court has observed on several occasions
that non-bailable warrants should not be issued, unless the accused
is charged with a heinous crime, and is likely to evade the process
of law or tamper/destroy evidence – Non-bailable warrants issued
in appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 9482/2021 are quashed
being unsustainable. [Paras 46]

exemption from personal appearance was rejected by the
Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, recording that as bail was
not obtained till then and there is no provision for granting
exemption from personal appearance prior to obtaining bail
– Correctness:
Held: Not correct, as the power to grant exemption from personal
appearance under the Code should not be read in a restrictive
manner as applicable only after the accused has been granted
bail – The power to grant exemption from personal appearance
should be exercised liberally, when facts and circumstances
require such exemption – s.205 states that the Magistrate,
exercising his discretion, may dispense with the personal
attendance of the accused while issuing summons, and allow
them to appear through their pleader – While provisions of the
Code are considered to be exhaustive, cases arise where the
Code is silent and the court has to make such order as the
ends of justice require – In such cases, the criminal court must
act on the principle, that every procedure which is just and fair,
is understood as permissible, till it is shown to be expressly or
impliedly prohibited by law. [Para 47]

Criminal Law – Civil disputes not involving criminal offence
– Duty of a Magistrate:
Held: A Magistrate needs to be cautious in examining whether the

initiating vexatious criminal proceedings should be thwarted early on,
as a summoning order, or even a direction to register an FIR, has
grave consequences for setting the criminal proceedings in motion
– Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims which do not involve
any criminal offence, by way of applying pressure through criminal
prosecution, should be deprecated and discouraged. [Para 44]

Leave granted in the above matters.
2. The concerns which have arisen during the course of hearing the
present appeals are of particular significance for meeting the ends
of criminal justice, and relate to the nature of chargesheets filed in
some jurisdictions by the state/police. For the sake of convenience, we
would divide the judgment into two parts. The first part relates to the
legal issue, that is, the contents of the chargesheet in terms of Section
173(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731. The second part
deals with the factual aspects of each of the cases, and our decision.
PART I
3. The issue in the first part relates to chargesheets being filed
without stating sufficient details of the facts constituting the offense
or putting the relevant evidence on record. In some states, the
chargesheets merely carry a reproduction of the details mentioned
by the complainant in the First Information Report2, and then
proceed to state whether an offence is made out, or not made out,
without any elucidation on the evidence and material relied upon.
On this issue, the recent judgment of this Court in Dablu Kujur
1 “Code”, for short.
2 “FIR”, for short.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 93
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
v. State of Jharkhand3 aptly crystallises the legal position in the
following words:
“17. Ergo, having regard to the provisions contained in
Section 173 it is hereby directed that the Report of police
officer on the completion of investigation shall contain the
following:—
(i) A report in the form prescribed by the State
Government stating-
(a) the names of the parties;
(b) the nature of the information;
(c) the names of the persons who appear to be
acquainted with the circumstances of the case;
(d) whether any offence appears to have been
committed and, if so, by whom;
(e) whether the accused has been arrested;
(f) whether he has been released on his bond and,
if so, whether with or without sureties;
(g) whether he has been forwarded in custody
under section 170.
(h) Whether the report of medical examination of the
woman has been attached where investigation
relates to an offence under sections 376, 376A,
376AB, 376B, 376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB or
section 376E of the Penal Code, 1860”
(ii) If upon the completion of investigation, there is no
sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion
to justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate,
the Police officer in charge shall clearly state in the
Report about the compliance of Section 169 Cr. P.C.
(iii) When the report in respect of a case to which Section
170 applies, the police officer shall forward to the
3 [2024] 3 SCR 614 : 2024 SCC Online SC 269
94 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Magistrate along with the report, all the documents
or relevant extracts thereof on which the prosecution
proposes to rely other than those already sent to the
Magistrate during investigation; and the statements
recorded under Section 161 of all the persons whom
the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses.
(iv) In case of further investigation, the Police officer
in charge shall forward to the Magistrate a further
report or reports regarding such evidence in the form
prescribed and shall also comply with the details
mentioned in the above sub para (i) to (iii).”
4. The decision in Dablu Kujur (supra) refers to Section 157 of the
Code which inter alia states that, if on information received or
otherwise, an officer of the police station has reason to suspect
commission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156
to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to the
Magistrate empowered to take cognisance of the offence. Further,
he shall proceed in person or depute any of his subordinate officers
to proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and circumstances
of the case, and if necessary, to take measures for discovery and
arrest the offender. Such report is in the nature of a preliminary
report. As per Section 169 of the Code, if it appears to the officer
in-charge of the police station that there is not sufficient evidence
or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify forwarding the accused
to the Magistrate, then the officer shall release the person if he is
in custody on his executing a bond, with or without sureties, with a
direction to such person to appear if and when so required, before
the Magistrate empowered to take cognisance of the offence from
the police report.4
4 We clarify and respectfully agree with the view expressed by this Court in Siddharth v. State of Uttar
Pradesh and Another, (2022) 1 SCC 676, which has interpreted Section 170 of the Code. The word
‘custody’ used in the said Section does not contemplate either police or judicial custody, for otherwise
the Section would lead to unpalatable and incongruous consequences. It is observed that in normal and
ordinary course, the police should avoid arresting a person and sending him to jail, if it is possible for the
police to complete the investigation without his arrest and if every kind of cooperation is provided by the
accused to the investigating officer in completing the investigation. The word ‘custody’ in Section 170 has
to be interpreted liberally and merely connotes presentation of the accused by the investigating officer.
This is because personally liberty is an important aspect of the constitutional mandate. Existence of the
power of arrest, and justification for exercise thereof are two different aspects. Section 170 of the Code
does not impose an obligation on the officer in-charge to arrest each and every accused before or at the
time of filing of the chargesheet.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 95
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
5. Section 170 of the Code deals with the cases where it appears to
the officer that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground to
proceed. In such an event he is required to submit a police report
or chargesheet under Section 173(2) of the Code. Elucidating on
Section 173(2) of the Code in Dablu Kujur (supra), this Court
observed:
“12. We are more concerned with Section 173(2) as we
have found that the investigating officers while submitting
the chargesheet/Police Report do not comply with the
requirements of the said provision. Though it is true that
the form of the report to be submitted under Section
173(2) has to be prescribed by the State Government
and each State Government has its own Police Manual to
be followed by the police officers while discharging their
duty, the mandatory requirements required to be complied
with by such officers in the Police Report/Chargesheet are
laid down in Section 173, more particularly sub-section
(2) thereof.
13. It may be noted that though there are various reports
required to be submitted by the police in charge of the
police station before, during and after the investigation
as contemplated in Chapter XII of Cr. P.C., it is only the
report forwarded by the police officer to the Magistrate
under sub-section (2) of Section 173 Cr. P.C. that can form
the basis for the competent court for taking cognizance
thereupon. A chargesheet is nothing but a final report of
the police officer under Section 173(2) of Cr. P.C. It is
an opinion or intimation of the investigating officer to the
concerned court that on the material collected during the
course of investigation, an offence appears to have been
committed by the particular person or persons, or that no
offence appears to have been committed.
xx xx xx
15. The issues with regard to the compliance of Section
173(2) Cr. P.C., may also arise, when the investigating
officer submits Police Report only qua some of the
persons-accused named in the FIR, keeping open the
96 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
investigation qua the other persons-accused, or when all
the documents as required under Section 173(5) are not
submitted. In such a situation, the question that is often
posed before the court is whether such a Police Report
could be said to have been submitted in compliance with
sub-section (2) of Section 173 Cr. P.C. In this regard, it
may be noted that in Satya Narain Musadi v. State of
Bihar, this Court has observed that statutory requirement
of the report under Section 173(2) would be complied with
if various details prescribed therein are included in the
report. The report is complete if it is accompanied with all
the documents and statements of witnesses as required
by Section 175(5)…”
6. We would like to elaborate on certain aspects, as submission of the
chargesheet is for taking cognisance and summoning of the accused
by the Magistrate, which stages are of considerable importance and
significance.
7. Section 173 of the Code reads:
“173. Report of police officer on completion of investigation.—
(1) Every investigation under this Chapter shall be
completed without unnecessary delay.
(1A) The investigation in relation to an offence under
sections 376, 376A, 376AB, 376B, 376C, 376D, 376DA,
376DB or 376E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall
be completed within two months from the date on which
the information was recorded by the officer in charge of
the police station.
(2) (i) As soon as it is completed, the officer in charge of the
police station shall forward to a Magistrate empowered to
take cognizance of the offence on a police report, a report
in the form prescribed by the State Government, stating—
(a) the names of the parties;
(b) the nature of the information;
(c) the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted
with the circumstances of the case;
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 97
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
(d) whether any offence appears to have been committed
and, if so, by whom;
(e) whether the accused has been arrested;
(f) whether he has been released on his bond and, if
so, whether with or without sureties;
(g) whether he has been forwarded in custody under
section 170.
(h) whether the report of medical examination of the
woman has been attached where investigation
relates to an offence under [sections 376, 376A,
376AB, 376B,
376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB or section 376E of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860).
(ii) The officer shall also communicate, in such manner
as may be prescribed by the State Government, the
action taken by him, to the person, if any, by whom the
information relating to the commission of the offence
was first given.
(3) Where a superior officer of police has been appointed
under section 158, the report shall, in any case in which
the State Government by general or special order so
directs, be submitted through that officer, and he may,
pending the orders of the Magistrate, direct the officer in
charge of the police station to make further investigation.
(4) Whenever it appears from a report forwarded under this
section that the accused has been released on his bond,
the Magistrate shall make such order for the discharge of
such bond or otherwise as he thinks fit.
(5) When such report is in respect of a case to which
section 170 applies, the police officer shall forward to the
Magistrate along with the report—
(a) all documents or relevant extracts thereof on which
the prosecution proposes to rely other than those
already sent to the Magistrate during investigation;
98 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
(b) the statements recorded under section 161 of all the
persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine
as its witnesses.
(6) If the police officer is of opinion that any part of any
such statement is not relevant to the subject-matter of
the proceedings or that its disclosure to the accused is
not essential in the interests of justice and is inexpedient
in the public interest, he shall indicate that part of the
statement and append a note requesting the Magistrate
to exclude that part from the copies to be granted to the
accused and stating his reasons for making such request.
(7) Where the police officer investigating the case finds it
convenient so to do, he may furnish to the accused copies
of all or any of the documents referred to in sub-section (5).
(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude
further investigation in respect of an offence after a
report under sub-section (2) has been forwarded to the
Magistrate and, where upon such investigation, the officer
in charge of the police station obtains further evidence,
oral or documentary, he shall forward to the Magistrate
a further report or reports regarding such evidence in the
form prescribed; and the provisions of sub-sections (2) to
(6) shall, as far as may be, apply in relation to such report
or reports as they apply in relation to a report forwarded
under sub-section (2)”.
8. Sub-section (2) to Section 173 makes a considered departure from
sub-Section (1) to Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
18985. Sub-section (1)(a) to Section 173 of the 1898 Code had
stipulated that as soon as the investigation is completed, the officer
in-charge of the police station shall forward to the Magistrate, a report
in the form prescribed by the local government, sending forth the
names of the parties, nature of the information and the names of the
people who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the
case and state whether the accused person has been forwarded in
custody or released on a bond.
5 “1898 Code”, for short.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 99
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
9. We have referred to Section 173 of the 1898 Code, in view of reliance
placed during the course of hearing on the decision of this Court in
Tara Singh v. State6 and R.K. Dalmia etc. v. Delhi Administration7,
which refer and relate to the 1898 Code.
10. In Tara Singh’s case (supra), the question which had arisen was
whether the challan preferred by the police was complete so as to
enable the court to take cognisance within the meaning of Section
190(1)(b) of the 1898 Code. It was held that a challan submitted
in the said case was complete except for submission of the report
of the Imperial Serologist and drawing of the sketch map of the
occurrence. In this context, reference was made to Section 173(1)
of the 1898 Code and that the report/challan should set forth, viz.
the names of the parties, nature of the information and names of
persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the
case. The cognisance, it was held, was proper.
11. In R.K. Dalmia (supra), again a reference was made to Section 173(1)
of the 1898 Code and that the chargesheet must contain name of
the parties, nature of the information and the names of persons who
appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case. These
observations were made in the context of the submission made on
behalf of the accused that there was a change in the stand of the
prosecution, which contention was rejected on several grounds, as
mentioned in paragraphs 325 and 326 of the footnoted citation.
12. It is, therefore, apparent from the language of the legislation, that
under the Code, that is, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the
requirement and the manner of providing details in the chargesheet,
stand verified.
13. The question of the required details being complete must be
understood in a way which gives effect to the true intent of the
chargesheet under Section 173(2) of the Code. The requirement of
“further evidence” or a “supplementary chargesheet” as referred to
under Section 173(8) of the Code, is to make additions to a complete
chargesheet,8 and not to make up or reparate for a chargesheet
6 [1951] 1 SCR 729 : AIR 1951 SC 441
7 [1963] 1 SCR 253 : AIR 1962 SC 1821
8 State Through Central Bureau of Investigation v. Hemendhra Reddy & Anr., 2023 SCC OnLine SC 515
100 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
which does not fulfil requirements of Section 173(2) of the Code.
The chargesheet is complete when it refers to material and evidence
sufficient to take cognizance and for the trial. The nature and standard
of evidence to be elucidated in a chargesheet should prima facie
show that an offence is established if the material and evidence is
proven. The chargesheet is complete where a case is not exclusively
dependent on further evidence. The trial can proceed on the basis
of evidence and material placed on record with the chargesheet.
This standard is not overly technical or fool-proof, but a pragmatic
balance to protect the innocent from harassment due to delay as
well as prolonged incarceration, and yet not curtail the right of the
prosecution to forward further evidence in support of the charges9.
14. In the context of the present issue, it would be apt to refer to Section
190 and Section 204 of the Code, along with the provisions relating
to contents of charge, namely, Sections 211 to 213 and Section 218
of the Code, which read as under:
“190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates.—(1)
Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any Magistrate
of the first class, and any Magistrate of the second class
specially empowered in this behalf under sub-section (2),
may take cognizance of any offence—
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which
constitute such offence;
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
(c) upon information received from any person
other than a police officer, or upon his own
knowledge, that such offence has been
committed.
(2) The Chief Judicial Magistrate may empower any
Magistrate of the second class to take cognizance
under sub-section (1) of such offences as are within his
competence to inquire into or try.
xx xx xx
9 See also, para 21 below on the power of the police to investigate under Section 173(8) of the Code.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 101
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
204. Issue of process.—(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate
taking cognizance of an offence there is sufficient ground
for proceeding, and the case appears to be—
(a) a summons-case, he shall issue his
summons for the attendance of the
accused, or
(b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant,
or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing
the accused to be brought or to appear at
a certain time before such Magistrate or (if
he has no jurisdiction himself) some other
Magistrate having jurisdiction.
(2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the
accused under sub-section (1) until a list of the prosecution
witnesses has been filed.
(3) In a proceeding instituted upon a complaint made in
writing, every summons or warrant issued under sub-
section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such
complaint.
(4) When by any law for the time being in force any
process-fees or other fees are payable, no process shall
be issued until the fees are paid and, if such fees are not
paid within a reasonable time, the Magistrate may dismiss
the complaint.
(5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the
provisions of Section 87.
xx xx xx
211. Contents of charge.—(1) Every charge under this
Code shall state the offence with which the accused is
charged.
(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific
name, the offence may be described in the charge by that
name only.
(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it
any specific name, so much of the definition of the offence
102 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter
with which he is charged.
(4) The law and section of the law against which the
offence is said to have been committed shall be mentioned
in the charge.
(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a
statement that every legal condition required by law to
constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular
case.
(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the
Court.
(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any
offence, is liable, by reason of such previous conviction,
to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different
kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is intended to prove
such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the
punishment which the Court may think fit to award for
the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the
previous conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if
such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it
at any time before sentence is passed.
212. Particulars as to time, place and person.—(1)
The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time
and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any)
against whom, or the thing (if any) in respect of which, it
was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the
accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach
of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money or other
movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross
sum or, as the case may be, describe the movable property
in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been
committed, and the dates between which the offence
is alleged to have been committed, without specifying
particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed
shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the
meaning of Section 219:
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 103
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
Provided that the time included between the first and last
of such dates shall not exceed one year.
213. When manner of committing offence must be
stated.—When the nature of the case is such that the
particulars mentioned in Sections 211 and 212 do not give
the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he
is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars
of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed
as will be sufficient for that purpose.
xx xx xx
218. Separate charges for distinct offences.—(1) For
every distinct offence of which any person is accused
there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge
shall be tried separately:
Provided that where the accused person, by an application
in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is of opinion
that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby,
the Magistrate may try together all or any number of the
charges framed against such person.
(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall affect the operation of
the provisions of Sections 219, 220, 221 and 223.
15. On the submission of the police report, Dablu Kujur (supra) refers to
an earlier decision of this Court in Bhagwant Singh v. Commissioner
of Police and Another10, and discusses the power and the role of
the Magistrate when he receives the police report and the options
available to him, in the following words:
“14. When such a Police Report concludes that an offence
appears to have been committed by a particular person or
persons, the Magistrate has three options: (i) he may accept
the report and take cognizance of the offence and issue
process, (ii) he may direct further investigation under sub-
section (3) of Section 156 and require the police to make a
further report, or (iii) he may disagree with the report and
10 [1985] 3 SCR 942 : (1985) 2 SCC 537
104 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
discharge the accused or drop the proceedings. If such
Police Report concludes that no offence appears to have
been committed, the Magistrate again has three options:
(i) he may accept the report and drop the proceedings, or
(ii) he may disagree with the report and taking the view
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding further, take
cognizance of the offence and issue process, or (iii) he
may direct further investigation to be made by the police
under sub-section (3) of Section 156.”
It is in this context that the provisions of Sections 190 and 204 of
the Code become important. Clause (a) of Section 190 states that
the Magistrate can take cognisance of an offence on receiving a
complaint of facts which constitute such offence. Clause (b) relates
to a situation where the Magistrate receives a police report carrying
such facts, i.e., facts which constitute such offence. In Minu Kumari
and Another v. State of Bihar and Others11 this Court referred to
the options available to the Magistrate on how to proceed in terms
of Section 190(1)(b) of the Code, and held:
“11...The position is, therefore, now well settled that
upon receipt of a police report under Section 173(2) a
Magistrate is entitled to take cognizance of an offence
under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code even if the police
report is to the effect that no case is made out against
the accused. The Magistrate can take into account the
statements of the witnesses examined by the police
during the investigation and take cognizance of the
offence complained of and order the issue of process
to the accused. Section 190(1)(b) does not lay down
that a Magistrate can take cognizance of an offence
only if the investigating officer gives an opinion that the
investigation has made out a case against the accused.
The Magistrate can ignore the conclusion arrived at by
the investigating officer and independently apply his
mind to the facts emerging from the investigation and
take cognizance of the case, if he thinks fit, exercise
his powers under Section 190(1)(b) and direct the issue
11 [2006] 3 SCR 1086 : (2006) 4 SCC 359
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 105
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
of process to the accused. The Magistrate is not bound
in such a situation to follow the procedure laid down in
Sections 200 and 202 of the Code for taking cognizance
of a case under Section 190(1)(a) though it is open to
him to act under Section 200 or Section 202 also. (See
India Carat (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka [(1989) 2 SCC
132 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 306 : AIR 1989 SC 885] .)
12. The informant is not prejudicially affected when the
Magistrate decides to take cognizance and to proceed
with the case. But where the Magistrate decides that
sufficient ground does not subsist for proceeding further
and drops the proceeding or takes the view that there
is material for proceeding against some and there are
insufficient grounds in respect of others, the informant
would certainly be prejudiced as the first information
report lodged becomes wholly or partially ineffective.
This Court in Bhagwant Singh v. Commr. of Police held
that where the Magistrate decides not to take cognizance
and to drop the proceeding or takes a view that there is
no sufficient ground for proceeding against some of the
persons mentioned in the first information report, notice
to the informant and grant of opportunity of being heard
in the matter becomes mandatory. As indicated above,
there is no provision in the Code for issue of a notice in
that regard.
13. We may add here that the expressions “charge-sheet”
or “final report” are not used in the Code, but it is understood
in Police Manuals of several States containing the rules
and the regulations to be a report by the police filed under
Section 170 of the Code, described as a “charge-sheet”.
In case of reports sent under Section 169 i.e. where there
is no sufficiency of evidence to justify forwarding of a case
to a Magistrate, it is termed variously i.e. referred charge,
final report or summary. Section 173 in terms does not
refer to any notice to be given to raise any protest to the
report submitted by the police. Though the notice issued
under some of the Police Manuals states it to be a notice
under Section 173 of the Code, there is nothing in Section
173 specifically providing for such a notice.”
106 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
16. This Court in Bhushan Kumar and Another v. State (NCT of Delhi)
and Another12 while referring to Sections 190 and 204 of the Code
has observed that the expression “cognisance” in Section 190 merely
means “becoming aware of”, and when used with reference to a
court or a judge it connotes “to take notice of judicially”. It indicates
the juncture at which the court or Magistrate takes judicial notice of
the offence with a view to initiate proceedings in respect of such an
offence. This is different from initiation of proceedings. Rather, it is a
condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings by a Magistrate or
judge. At this stage, the Magistrate has to keep in mind the averments
in the complaint or the police report, and has to evaluate whether
there is sufficient ground for initiation of proceedings. This is not the
same as the consideration of sufficient grounds for conviction, as
whether evidence is sufficient for supporting the conviction or not,
can be determined only at the stage of trial, and not at the stage of
cognisance. This aspect is important and will be subsequently referred
to when we examine the decision of this Court in K. Veeraswami v.
Union of India and Others13, and the observations therein which
have been referred to on several occasions in other judgments.
17. Section 204 of the Code does not mandate the Magistrate to
explicitly state the reasons for issue of summons and this is not a
prerequisite for deciding the validity of the summons. Nevertheless,
the requirement of the Code is that the summons is issued when it
appears to the Magistrate that there is sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused. Summons is issued to the person against whom
the legal proceedings have commenced. Wilful disobedience is liable
to be punished under Section 174 of the Indian Penal Code, 186014.
As a sequitur, keeping in mind both the language of Section 204 of
the Code and the penal consequences, the Magistrate is mandated
to form an opinion as to whether there exists sufficient ground for
summons to be issued. While deciding whether summons is to be
issued to a person, the Magistrate can take into consideration any
prima facie improbabilities arising in the case. The parameters on
which a summoning order can be interfered with are well settled by
the decision of this court in Bhushan Kumar (supra). The Magistrate
12 [2012] 2 SCR 696 : (2012) 5 SCC 424
13 [1991] 3 SCR 189 : (1991) 3 SCC 655
14 “IPC”, for short.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 107
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
in terms of Section 204 of the Code is required to exercise his
judicial discretion with a degree of caution, even when he is not
required to record reasons, on whether there is sufficient ground for
proceeding. Proceedings initiated by a criminal court are generally
not interfered with by High Courts, unless necessary to secure the
ends of justice.15
18. The decision in Bhushan Kumar (supra) also refers to Section 251
of the Code, which is a stage post appearance of the accused, and
observes:
“20. It is inherent in Section 251 of the Code that when
an accused appears before the trial court pursuant to
summons issued under Section 204 of the Code in a
summons trial case, it is the bounden duty of the trial
court to carefully go through the allegations made in the
charge-sheet or complaint and consider the evidence to
come to a conclusion whether or not, commission of any
offence is disclosed and if the answer is in the affirmative,
the Magistrate shall explain the substance of the accusation
to the accused and ask him whether he pleads guilty
otherwise, he is bound to discharge the accused as per
Section 239 of the Code.”
19. Sections 211 to 213 and Section 218 of the Code deal with the
contents of the charge. The object and purpose of these provisions
is to bring the nature of allegations against the accused to his
notice. These allegations have to be proved and established by
leading evidence. The accused should not be taken by surprise or
be unbeknownst so as to cause prejudice to him. The provisions
of the Code also prescribe how to interpret the words used in the
charge in terms of Section 214 of the Code, the effect of defects in
the charge in terms of Section 215 of the Code, the power of the
court to alter the charge and recall of the witnesses when a charge
is altered in terms of Sections 216 and 217 of the Code.
20. There is an inherent connect between the chargesheet submitted
under Section 173(2) of the Code, cognisance which is taken under
Section 190 of the Code, issue of process and summoning of the
15 R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866; State of Haryana and Others v. Bhajan Lal and Others,
1992 Supp (1) SCC 335
108 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
accused under Section 204 of the Code, and thereupon issue of
notice under Section 251 of the Code, or the charge in terms of
Chapter XVII of the Code. The details set out in the chargesheet
have a substantial impact on the efficacy of procedure at the
subsequent stages. The chargesheet is integral to the process
of taking cognisance, the issue of notice and framing of charge,
being the only investigative document and evidence available to
the court till that stage. Substantiated reasons and grounds for
an offence being made in the chargesheet are a key resource for
a Magistrate to evaluate whether there are sufficient grounds for
taking cognisance, initiating proceedings, and then issuing notice,
framing charges etc.
21. These provisions, however, have to be read along with the power of
the police to investigate under sub-section (8) to Section 173 of the
Code even when they have submitted a report under sub-section
(2) to Section 173 of the Code. The police also has the power to
produce additional documents and evidence, as has been held
by this Court in Parkash Singh Badal and Another v. State of
Punjab and Others16; Narendra Kumar Amin v. Central Bureau of
Investigation and Others17; and Central Bureau of Investigation
v. R.S. Pai and Another18.
22. Recently a three Judge Bench of this Court in Zakia Ahsan Jafri v.
State of Gujarat and Another19, has observed:
“11. This Court in Dayal Singh noted that the investigating
officer is obliged to act as per the Police Manual and
known canons of practice while being diligent, truthful
and fair in his/her approach and investigation. It has been
noted in the reported decision that an investigating officer
is completely responsible and answerable for the manner
and methodology adopted in completing his investigation.
Concededly, upon completion of investigation, the
investigating officer is obliged to submit report setting
out prescribed details, to the Magistrate empowered
16 [2006] Supp. 10 SCR 197 : (2007) 1 SCC 1

[2024] 6 S.C.R. 109
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
to take cognizance of the offence referred to therein,
without unnecessary delay. The report so presented is
the conclusion reached by the investigating officer on
the basis of materials collected during investigation. The
duty of the investigating officer is to collate every relevant
information/material during the investigation, which he
must believe to be the actual course of events and the
true facts unraveling the commission of the alleged crime
and the person involved in committing the same. He is
expected to examine the materials from all angles. In the
event, there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground
that an offence appears to have been committed and
the person committing such offence has been identified,
the investigating officer is obliged to record his opinion
in that regard, as required by Section 173(2)(i)(d) of the
Code. In other words, if the investigating officer intends
to send the accused for trial, he is obliged to form a
firm opinion not only about the commission of offence,
but also about the involvement of such person in the
commission of crime.
12. Such opinion is the culmination of the analysis of
the materials collected during the investigation - that
there is “strong suspicion” against the accused, which
eventually will lead the concerned Court to think that
there is a ground for “presuming” that the accused “has”
committed the alleged offence; and not a case of mere
suspicion. For being a case of strong suspicion, there
must exist sufficient materials to corroborate the facts and
circumstances of the case; and be of such weight that it
would facilitate the Court concerned to take cognizance
of the crime and eventually lead it to think (form opinion)
that there is ground “for presuming that the accused has
committed an offence”, as alleged – so as to frame a
charge against him in terms of Section 228(1) or 246(1)
of the Code, as the case may be. For taking cognizance
of the crime or to frame charges against the accused, the
Court must analyze the report filed by the investigating
officer and all the materials appended thereto and then
form an independent prima facie opinion as to whether
110 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
there is ground for “presuming” that the accused “has”
committed an offence, as alleged. (It is not, “may” have
or “likely” to have committed an offence, but a ground
for presuming that he has committed an offence). The
Magistrate in the process may have to give due weightage
to the opinion of the investigating officer. If such is to be
the eventual outcome of the final report presented by
the investigating officer, then there is nothing wrong if he
applies the same standard to form an opinion about the
materials collected during the investigation and articulate
it in the report submitted under Section 173 of the Code.
It may be useful to refer to the decisions adverted to in
Afroz Mohd. Hasanfata including in the case of Ramesh
Singh and I.K. Nangia.
xx xx xx
63. Needless to underscore that every information coming
to the investigating agency must be regarded as relevant.
However, the investigating agency is expected to make
enquiries regarding the authenticity of such information and
after doing so must collect corroborative evidence in support
thereof. In absence of corroborative evidence, it would be
merely a case of suspicion and not pass the muster of
grave suspicion, which is the pre-requisite for sending the
suspect for trial. This is the mandate in Section 173(2)(i)(d)
of the Code, which postulates that the investigating officer
in his report must indicate whether any offence appears to
have been committed and if so, by whom. The opinion of
the investigating officer formed on the basis of materials
collected during the investigation/enquiry must be given due
weightage. That would only be the threshold, to facilitate
the concerned Court to take cognizance of the crime and
then frame charge if it is of the opinion that there is ground
for presuming that the accused has committed an offence
triable under Chapter XIX of the Code.”
23. In K. Veeraswami (supra), K. Jagannatha Shetty, J. pronounced the
judgment for himself and M.N. Venkatachaliah, J. (as His Lordship then
was) on the question of contents of the chargesheet and observed:
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 111
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
“75. In the view that we have taken as to the nature
of the offence created under clause (e), it may not be
necessary to examine the contention relating to ingredient
of the offence. But since the legality of the charge-sheet
has been impeached, we will deal with that contention
also. Counsel laid great emphasis on the expression
“for which he cannot satisfactorily account” used in
clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act. He argued that
that term means that the public servant is entitled to an
opportunity before the Investigating Officer to explain the
alleged disproportionality between assets and the known
sources of income. The Investigating Officer is required to
consider his explanation and the charge-sheet filed by him
must contain such averment. The failure to mention that
requirement would vitiate the charge-sheet and renders
it invalid. This submission, if we may say so, completely
overlooks the powers of the Investigating Officer. The
Investigating Officer is only required to collect material
to find out whether the offence alleged appears to have
been committed. In the course of the investigation, he
may examine the accused. He may seek his clarification
and if necessary he may cross check with him about his
known sources of income and assets possessed by him.
Indeed, fair investigation requires as rightly stated by Mr
A.D. Giri, learned Solicitor General, that the accused
should not be kept in darkness. He should be taken into
confidence if he is willing to cooperate. But to state that
after collection of all material the Investigating Officer
must give an opportunity to the accused and call upon him
to account for the excess of the assets over the known
sources of income and then decide whether the accounting
is satisfactory or not, would be elevating the Investigating
Officer to the position of an enquiry officer or a judge. The
Investigating Officer is not holding an enquiry against the
conduct of the public servant or determining the disputed
issues regarding the disproportionality between the assets
and the income of the accused. He just collects material
from all sides and prepares a report which he files in the
court as charge-sheet.”
112 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
The latter portion of the aforesaid paragraph, referring to the details
of the offence and the requirement for them to be proved in order
to bring home the guilt of the accused at the later stage (the stage
of trial) by adducing acceptable evidence, has to be understood
in the context that the chargesheet need not elaborately evaluate
the evidence, as the process of evaluation is a matter of trial. This
does not mean that the chargesheet should not disclose or refer
to the facts as to meet the requirements of Section 173(2) of the
Code, and the mandate of the State rules. Further, the earlier
portion of the same paragraph, while referring to the opinion of
the investigating officer, does so to demonstrate the significance
of the opinion of the investigating officer at this stage. However,
this does not preclude the Magistrate from exercising her powers
in adopting an approach independent from such opinion, as has
been held by this Court in Bhagwant Singh (supra) and Minu
Kumari (supra).
24. It is the police report which would enable the Magistrate to decide a
course of action from the options available to him. The details of the
offence and investigation are not supposed to be a comprehensive
thesis of the prosecution case, but at the same time, must reflect
a thorough investigation into the alleged offence. It is on the basis
of this record that the court can take effective cognisance of the
offence and proceed to issue process in terms of Section 190(1)(b)
and Section 204 of the Code. In case of doubt or debate, or if no
offence is made out, it is open to the Magistrate to exercise other
options which are available to him.
25. In support of our reasoning, we would refer to the very next paragraph
in the judgment of Shetty, J. in K. Veeraswami (supra) which reads
as under:
“76. The charge-sheet is nothing but a final report of police
officer under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The Section
173(2) provides that on completion of the investigation
the police officer investigating into a cognizable offence
shall submit a report. The report must be in the form
prescribed by the State Government and stating therein
(a) the names of the parties; (b) the nature of the
information; (c) the names of the persons who appear
to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case; (d)
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 113
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
whether any offence appears to have been committed
and, if so, by whom (e) whether the accused has been
arrested; (f) whether he had been released on his bond
and, if so, whether with or without sureties; and (g) whether
he has been forwarded in custody under Section 170. As
observed by this Court in Satya Narain Musadi v. State of
Bihar that the statutory requirement of the report under
Section 173(2) would be complied with if the various
details prescribed therein are included in the report.
This report is an intimation to the magistrate that upon
investigation into a cognizable offence the Investigating
Officer has been able to procure sufficient evidence for
the court to inquire into the offence and the necessary
information is being sent to the court. In fact, the report
under Section 173(2) purports to be an opinion of the
Investigating Officer that as far as he is concerned he
has been able to procure sufficient material for the trial
of the accused by the court. The report is complete if it
is accompanied with all the documents and statements of
witnesses as required by Section 175(5). Nothing more
need be stated in the report of the Investigating Officer.
It is also not necessary that all the details of the offence
must be stated. The details of the offence are required
to be proved to bring home the guilt to the accused at
a later stage i.e. in the course of the trial of the case by
adducing acceptable evidence.
This paragraph examines the contents of the chargesheet and
on elaboration of the same holds that it is in accordance with the
terms of Section 173(2) of the Code as well as the provisions of the
penal enactment. In furtherance of this, reference is made to Satya
Narain Musadi and Others v. State of Bihar20, in stating that the
chargesheet should comply with the statutory requirements, and the
various details prescribed therein should be included in the report.
26. The object and purpose of the police investigation is manyfold. It
includes the need to ensure transparent and free investigation to
ascertain the facts, examine whether or not an offence is committed,
20 (1980) 3 SCC 152
114 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
identify the offender if an offence is committed, and to lay before the
court the evidence which has been collected, the truth and correctness
of which is thereupon decided by the court.
27. In H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi21, this Court
notes that the process of investigation generally consists of: 1)
proceeding to the concerned spot, 2) ascertainment of facts and
circumstances, 3) discovery and arrest, 4) collection of evidence
which includes examination of various persons, search of places
and seizure of things, and 5) formation of an opinion on whether
an offence is made out, and filing the chargesheet accordingly.
The formation of opinion is therefore the culmination of several
stages that an investigation goes through. This Court in its decision
in Abhinandan Jha and Others v. Dinesh Mishra22 states that
the submission of the chargesheet or the final report is dependent
on the nature of opinion formed, which is the final step in the
investigation.
28. The final report has to be prepared with these aspects in mind and
should show with sufficient particularity and clarity, the contravention
of the law which is alleged. When the report complies with the said
requirements, the court concerned should apply its mind whether
or not to take cognisance and also proceed by issuing summons
to the accused. While doing so, the court will take into account the
statement of witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the Code and
the documents placed on record by the investigating officer.
29. In case of any doubts or ambiguity arising in ascertaining the facts
and evidence, the Magistrate can, before taking cognisance, call
upon the investigating officer to clarify and give better particulars,
order further investigation, or even record statements in terms of
Section 202 of the Code.
30. Our attention has been drawn to the format prescribed for the State
of Uttar Pradesh, which by column 16 requires the investigating
officer to state brief facts of the case. In addition, the State of Uttar
Pradesh has issued a circular dated 19.09.2023, which refers to an
earlier circular bearing No. 59 of 2016 dated 20.10.2016, and states
21 [1955] 1 SCR 1150 : (1954) 2 SCC 934
22 [1967] 3 SCR 668 : AIR 1968 SC 117
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 115
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
that the investigation provisions contained in the Code and the police
regulations with reference to Section 173 of the Code are not being
consistently complied with and followed by the investigating officers
and the supervising officers. The need to provide lead details of
the offence in the chargesheet is mandatory as it is in accord with
paragraph 122 of the police regulations. Similar directions were
issued on 09.09.2022 following the direction of the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad that brief narration of the material collected
during investigation, which forms the opinion of the investigating
officer, should be mentioned in the chargesheet.
31. Therefore, the investigating officer must make clear and complete
entries of all columns in the chargesheet so that the court can clearly
understand which crime has been committed by which accused and
what is the material evidence available on the file. Statements under
Section 161 of the Code and related documents have to be enclosed
with the list of witnesses. The role played by the accused in the crime
should be separately and clearly mentioned in the chargesheet, for
each of the accused persons.
PART II
32. As we turn to the second part of our judgment, it would be appropriate
to lead our decision in each case with a brief overview of its pertinent
facts:
A. Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1074/2017
● The appellants have been involved in a drawn-out litigation
with several parties over the ownership of Property No.
80-A, 23,072 sq. ft., forming a part of Khasra no. 1016/647
and 645, situated within Chandrawli/Shahdara, now in
Abadi, at Circular Road, Shahdara, Delhi- 110032.23
● Appellant No.2 – Sharif Ahmad and Appellant No.3 – Anwar
Ahmad (since deceased), purchased a part in the subject
property on behalf of their partnership firm Dream Land &
Co., while Appellant No.1 – Vakil Ahmad (since deceased)
had done so in his individual capacity.
23 “subject property”, for short.
116 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
● To avoid prolixity, we would refrain from setting out the
facts of the litigation in detail.
● The challenge before us relates to the First Information
Report No. 108/2016 dated 23.05.2016, filed by Respondent
No.2/complainant - Mohd. Iqbal, under Sections 420, 406
and 506 IPC at police station Hafizpur, Hapur, U.P. against
the appellants. The FIR stated that the appellants had
agreed to sell the subject property to Respondent No.
2 and had received part payment for the registry of the
subject property. However, the appellants did not register
the property and also failed to refund the concerned amount
to Respondent No. 2.
● The Police recorded the statements of Respondent No.2,
and the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code.
● According to these statements, the appellants had refused
to refund the amount paid by Respondent No. 2 despite
repeated requests to do the same.
● A complaint dated 03.09.2016 was filed against Respondent
No. 2 at Police Station Tis Hazari by relatives of the
appellants on account of receiving threats to their life.
● The appellants challenged FIR No. 108/2016 in W.P.
(Cr.) No.20221/2016 before the Allahabad High Court
and sought quashing of the proceedings. By an order
dated 15.09.2016, the High Court stayed the arrest of the
appellant until filing of the chargesheet.
● On 24.10.2016, a chargesheet was filed against the
appellants under Sections 405 and 506 IPC.
● The appellants approached the Allahabad High Court
in Cr. M.A. No. 960/2017 seeking the quashing of the
chargesheet and of proceedings in Case No. 410/2016.
The appellants submitted that the chargesheet is vague,
filed without proper investigation, and fails to make out
any offence.
● The Allahabad High Court dismissed the application for
quashing of the chargesheet through the impugned order
dated 12.01.2017.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 117
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
● Hence, the appellants have filed the present appeal.
33. The FIR as registered, on the question of intimidation states that on
19.03.2016 the appellants had flatly refused to refund the money and
had told Respondent No. 2 that they can do whatever they want.
They had threatened the entire family of the complainant.
34. The chargesheet submitted by the investigating officer in the present
case, under column 16 referring to the facts of the case, reads as
under:
“Sir, the above said case was got registered by the
complainant Shri Iqbal on 23/5/16 at this police station,
the investigation of which handed over to me S.I., the
investigation of which done by me S.I. and from all the
investigation till now, statement of the complainant,
statement of the witnesses and inspection of place of
occurrence, the deal of plot measuring 2600 which is at
behind Sadar Police Station was finalized by the accused
persons with the complainant and his partner Surender
Sharma for 4 crore, for which by not getting executed
the registry of the same at the time of the complainant
and after receiving a sum of Rs. 1 crore of his partner
Surender Sharma as earnest money, selling of plot to
Kusum Jain and D.K. Jain, by not refunding a sum of
Rs. 1 crore of the complainant and his partner, grabbing
by doing breach of trust, making pretexts on demanding
again and again and the threat to kill, hence the offence
under section 406, 506 I.P.C. is thoroughly proved upon
the accused persons Sharif Ahmed, Anwar Ahmed, Vakil
Ahmed, Aadil Ahmed, the occurrence of section 420 I.P.C.
is not found, hence the challan of the accused persons, by
charge sheet No. 153/16 is filled in the court, it is prayed
that punishment may be given by calling the proof.”
35. A reading thereof would indicate that it refers to the complaint made
by Respondent No. 2 – Iqbal on 23.05.2016 relating to the deal of
a plot in respect of which part consideration was paid as earnest
money. But thereafter, the appellants had sold the plot and were not
refunding the earnest money and by doing so have committed breach
of trust under Section 406 of the IPC. It also refers to the alleged
pretexts being made by the appellants on money being demanded
118 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
and a threat to kill being extended. It is also recorded that an offence
under Section 506 has been proved to have been committed. At the
same time, the chargesheet states that no offence under Section
420 of the IPC is found to have been committed.
36. An offence under Section 406 of the IPC requires entrustment, which
carries the implication that a person handing over any property or
on whose behalf the property is handed over, continues to be the
owner of the said property. Further, the person handing over the
property must have confidence in the person taking the property to
create a fiduciary relationship between them. A normal transaction
of sale or exchange of money/consideration does not amount to
entrustment.24 Clearly, the charge/offence of Section 406 IPC is not
even remotely made out.
37. The chargesheet states that the offence under Section 420 is not
made out. The offence of cheating under Section 415 of the IPC
requires dishonest inducement, delivering of a property as a result
of the inducement, and damage or harm to the person so induced.
The offence of cheating is established when the dishonest intention
exists at the time when the contract or agreement is entered, for the
essential ingredient of the offence of cheating consists of fraudulent
or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him to deliver
any property, to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or
omit if he had not been deceived. As per the investigating officer,
no fraudulent and dishonest inducement is made out or established
at the time when the agreement was entered.
38. An offence of criminal intimidation arises when the accused
intendeds to cause alarm to the victim, though it does not matter
whether the victim is alarmed or not. The intention of the accused
to cause alarm must be established by bringing evidence on record.
The word ‘intimidate’ means to make timid or fearful, especially: to
compel or deter by or as if by threats.25 The threat communicated
or uttered by the person named in the chargesheet as an accused,
should be uttered and communicated by the said person to threaten
24 See Section 405 of the IPC and judgments of this Court in State of Gujarat v. Jaswantlal Nathalal AIR
1968 SC 700; Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd. and Others (2006) 6 SCC 736; Central Bureau of
Investigation, SPE, SIU(X), New Delhi v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta (1996) 5 SCC 591

[2024] 6 S.C.R. 119
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
the victim for the purpose of influencing her mind. The word ‘threat’
refers to the intent to inflict punishment, loss or pain on the other.
Injury involves doing an illegal act.
39. This Court in Manik Taneja and Another v. State of Karnataka
and Another26, had referred to Section 506 which prescribes
punishment for the offence of ‘criminal intimidation’ as defined in
Section 503 of the IPC, to observe that the offence under Section
503 requires that there must be an act of threating another person
with causing an injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the
person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested.
This threat must be with the intent to cause alarm to the person
threatened or to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or
omit to do an act which he is entitled to do. Mere expression of any
words without any intent to cause alarm would not be sufficient to
bring home an offence under Section 506 of the IPC. The material
and evidence must be placed on record to show that the threat
was made with an intent to cause alarm to the complainant, or to
cause them to do, or omit to do an act. Considering the statutory
mandate, offence under Section 506 is not shown even if we accept
the allegation as correct.
40. In view of the aforesaid position, we quash the chargesheet and
the summoning order. The appellants are discharged. We clarify
that the observations made above will have no bearing on the civil
proceedings, if any, already initiated or which may be initiated in
future by the respondent/complainant.
B. Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 5419/2022
● On 26.06.2019 the complainant – Wakeel Ahmad filed a
complaint before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,
alleging that the accused persons, including the appellant

accused persons had threatened the complainant against
pursuing legal action against them.
● By an order dated 19.09.2019, the High Court partly allowed
the appellant’s anticipatory bail application and directed
the police not to arrest the appellant till the submission
of the chargesheet.
● Chargesheet No. 582/2019 dated 18.10.2019 was filed,
submitting that charges under Sections 420 and 120B IPC
are established. The chargesheet lists the details of the
accused as mentioned in the FIR and the relevant column
relating to brief facts in the chargesheet reads:
“Requesting to the Hon’ble Court is that on
28.07.2019 the Hon’ble Court ordered under
section 156(3) Cr. P.C. for registering a FIR
No. 519/2019 under the section of 420, 120B
IPC against
1. Ziyauddin S/o Gyasudding aged about

Hence, filing this charge sheet before the
Hon’ble court and requesting to this Hon’ble
court to punish the all the accused.”
● By an order dated 10.05.2021, the Allahabad High
Court granted interim anticipatory bail to the appellant
till 03.01.2022, in terms of the conditions mentioned in
the order, and observed that the appellant herein may
approach the High Court again if so advised, in case of
a change in circumstances.
● On 23.03.2022, Allahabad High Court dismissed the
Criminal Misc. Anticipatory Bail Application No.2235/2022
filed by the appellant, on the grounds of non-bailable
warrants having been issued against the appellant and
the chargesheet having been filed.
● Hence, the appellant has filed the present appeal.
41. We have already referred to the facts and also to the ingredients
of the offence under Section 420 IPC. The assertions made in the
FIR allege that the accused are frauds who have taken bainama
(earnest money on the property), but thereafter are making excuses.
The complainant had visited the accused at their house who had
then threatened them to implicate them in false cases. They denied
having received the money.
42. We allow the present appeal and direct that in the event of the
appellant being arrested, he shall be released on bail by the arresting
officer/investigating officer/trial court on the terms and conditions to
be fixed by the trial court.
43. However, what is surprising and a matter of concern in the present
case, is that the police had initially rightly not registered the FIR, which
had prompted the complainant to approach the Court of Additional
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chandpur, Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, alleging
that he is an honest and respected person in the society and is well
established in business, while the accused are fraudulent individuals.
The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate had subsequently ordered
for the FIR to be registered on the basis of the written complaint.
44. We would also like to emphasise on the need for a Magistrate to
be cautious in examining whether the facts of the case disclose a
civil or a criminal wrong. Attempts at initiating vexatious criminal
122 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
proceedings should be thwarted early on, as a summoning order,
or even a direction to register an FIR, has grave consequences for
setting the criminal proceedings in motion.27 Any effort to settle civil
disputes and claims which do not involve any criminal offence, by
way of applying pressure through criminal prosecution, should be
deprecated and discouraged.28
C. Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 9482/2021
● The complainant and Respondent No. 2 herein – Rajesh
Wangvelu made a written complaint to the Station
Officer, Police Station Aliganj, Lucknow, alleging that on
23.12.2019 at about 12:15 p.m. two officers of the National
Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property,
Lucknow29, namely, Bachhan Singh Rawat, Security Officer
and Mahendra Kumar, Division Clerk/Caretaker had
attacked him with a helmet and lathi, and had threatened
to kill him. At about 1:12 p.m. FIR No. 556/2019 dated
23.12.2019 was registered against Bachhan Singh Rawat
and Mahendra Kumar under Section 323, 504 and 506 IPC.
● A statement under Section 161 of the Code was also
recorded, where Rajesh Wangvelu stated that he was
discriminated against for belonging to a different State. He
had done nothing wrong and did not allow his subordinates
to do anything wrong, for which reason Bachhan Singh
Rawat and Mahender Kumar remained angry with him. He
added in his statement that the appellant – Manager Singh
was also present during this altercation. He had abused
him and stated – “maaro sale ko, bahut imandaar banta
hai” i.e., “hit him, he wants to be too honest”. Bachhan
Singh Rawat and Mahendra Kumar had hit him till he
fainted. When he regained consciousness, they had left
the place.
● Manager Singh, as the Director General of the NRLC,
claims that he had noticed several discrepancies and

29 “NRLC”, for short.
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 123
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
administrative errors committed by Rajesh Wangvelu,
who was working as the Library and Information Officer.
● After issuing show-cause notices to Rajesh Wangvelu and
considering his response, the Ministry of Culture issued a
letter dated 02.08.2019, under the signature of appellant,
indicating that Rajesh Wangvelu prima facie appeared to
have committed temporary embezzlement of Rs. 38,338/-
and for which action should be taken.
● A decision to shift the library was also confirmed by a
committee, to which Rajesh Wangvelu had expressed
his displeasure. On the day of shifting, i.e. 23.12.2019, a
physical altercation occurred between Rajesh Wangvelu
and the officers Bachhan Singh Rawat and Mahendra
Kumar.
● Manager Singh has relied upon written communication
of Bachhan Singh Rawat in which he has stated that
on 23.12.2019 at about 12:00 noon, he was informed
by Mahendra Kumar, that Rajesh Wangvelu had taken
some items in his bag without the gate pass. Information
in this regard had been given to Manager Singh and the
Vigilance Officer. When Bachhan Singh Rawat had tried
to frisk Rajesh Wangvelu, he had, in presence of another
staff member Dr. Neeta Nigam, threatened Bachhan Singh
Rawat and Mahendra Kumar with dire consequences and
had sprayed chemical on their faces. Rajesh Wangvelu
had assaulted them and thereupon had run away from
the spot. On 23.12.2019 Manager Singh had accordingly
written a letter to the Station Officer of Aliganj Police
Station, informing him of the incident. Manager Singh
is also relying on the communication dated 26.12.2019
written by him to the Director General of Police, Lucknow,
and the communication dated 06.01.2020 by the appellant
Manager Singh to the sub-inspector, and inquiry officer
Police Station Aliganj.
● Rajesh Wangvelu was examined at 01:30 p.m., and his
medical legal report dated 23.12.2019 refers to six injuries
which have been found to be caused by a hard and
blunt object. The injuries were simple. Rajesh Wangvelu,
124 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
however, also relies upon a report dated 24.12.2019,
obtained by a private diagnostic centre, which states that
there was a fracture at the head of the fifth metacarpal
bone of the left hand.
● Manager Singh filed a petition for quashing of the
proceedings arising out of FIR No. 556/2019 before the
Allahabad High Court. He was given the benefit of arrest
till the filing of the chargesheet, by an order of the High
Court dated 09.01.2020.
● On 04.02.2020, a chargesheet was filed with an addition
of Sections 308, 325 and 120B IPC, and impleading
Manager Singh as an accused. The chargesheet under
Section 173 of the Code, submitted before the court in
the present case, under the column relating to brief facts
of the case reads as under:
“Sir, the aforesaid case was registered on
the basis of written report/complaint of the
complainant of the case and the investigation
was being done by the S.I. Shri Ramchandra
Mishra. On 15.01.2020 I have received the
investigation. During the investigation, on the
basis of the statement of the complainant
as well as on the basis of medical report,
section 120B/308/325 IPC was added and
the name of accused Manager Singh has
come into light, in which Bachan Sing Rawat
and Mahendra Kumar were sent in judicial
custody on 24.12.19. Till the filing of charge
sheet, the accused Manager Singh has been
granted stay of arrest by the court. The offences
under Section 323/504/506/120B/308/325 IPC
are duly proved against the accused Bachan
Singh Rawat, Mahendra Kumar and Manger
Singh. Therefore, charge sheet is filed against
the accused Bachan Singh Rawat, Mahendra
Kumar and Manager Singh under Section
323/504/506/120B/308/325 IPC before the
Hon’ble Court. It is requested to summon the
proof and punish and accused.”
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 125
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
● On the chargesheet being submitted in the court of the
Magistrate, order dated 10.02.2020 was passed recording
that the chargesheet has been submitted for offences under
323, 504, 506, 120B, 308, 325 of the IPC against Bachhan
Singh Rawat, Mahendra Kumar and Manager Singh. The
order, taking cognisance and issuing summons, reads:
“The chargesheet was filed under the offence number
556/2019, Section 323, 504, 506, 120B, 308, 325,
IPC, Police Station Aliganj against the accused
Bachan Singh Rawat, Mahendra Kumar and Manager
Singh. Reviewed all prosecution forms. The grounds
for taking cognizance are sufficient. Cognizance is
taken.
ORDER
Register the case. The copies are ready attached.
Accused Bachan Singh Rawat and Mahendra Kumar
are out on bail. Jamanatnama is attached in the file
and the arrest of the accused Manager Singh was
a stay on the arrest till the filing of the chargesheet
in the sequence of the order of the Hon’ble High
Court, Miscellaneous Bench – 262/2020 order dated
09-01-20. Summons issued against the accused.
Giving copy for paperwork. Attendance should be
presented on 01-03-2020.”
● It appears that the matter was taken up for hearing
by the Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow on
18.02.2021, which records the presence of the counsel for
Rajesh Wangvelu and that application for exemption from
personal appearance was moved on behalf of Bachhan
Singh Rawat and Mahendra Kumar. Manager Singh was
absent and bailable warrants were issued against him,
and he was required to appear on 04.03.2021.
● On 04.03.2021, an application for exemption from personal
appearance was moved on behalf of Manager Singh on
the ground that he had gone out for personal reasons
where he had taken ill. This application was rejected
on 04.03.2021 by the Special Chief Judicial Magistrate,
recording that Manager Singh had not obtained bail till
126 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
then and there is no provision for granting exemption from
personal appearance prior to obtaining bail. Therefore,
non-bailable warrants have been issued against him.
● Another order dated 04.03.2021 records that bailable
warrants were issued against Manager Singh but he had
remained absent. To ensure his personal appearance
non-bailable warrants were issued against him.
● By the impugned order dated 16.03.2021, the High Court
had dismissed the petition filed by Manager Singh under
Section 482 of the Code, to quash the criminal proceedings
against him.
● On 03.09.2021, the High Court granted a further period of
10 days’ time to Manager Singh to surrender. He did not
surrender and filed another application seeking extension
of time to surrender.
● On 03.12.2021, Manager Singh filed the present appeal
challenging correctness of the impugned order dated
16.03.2021.
● Rajesh Wangvelu has, before us, referred to FIR No.
224 of 2020 registered under Sections 406, 419, 420,
467, 468, 471 IPC on account of certain contracts having
been awarded by Manager Singh, Dr. Neeta Nigam,
Bachhan Singh Rawat, Mahendra Kumar, to M/s. V.K.
Singh Construction Company, Punjab, in which case a
final report has been submitted to the court. He has also
referred to an office order dated 03.09.2021 passed by
the Government of India, Ministry of Culture, terminating
services of Manager Singh with immediate effect.
45. Having regard to the facts of the present case, including the
chargesheet as filed, which in our opinion is bereft of all details and
particulars, we quash the summoning order against Manager Singh.
The Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, would re-examine the entire
matter in terms of the observations made in the present judgment
and thereupon proceed in accordance with law.
46. We, however, would allow the present appeal to the extent that
the non-bailable warrants issued against Manager Singh are
unsustainable and should be quashed. It is a settled position of law
[2024] 6 S.C.R. 127
Sharif Ahmed and Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
that non-bailable warrants cannot be issued in a routine manner
and that the liberty of an individual cannot be curtailed unless
necessitated by the larger interest of public and the State. While
there are no comprehensive set of guidelines for the issuance of
non-bailable warrants, this Court has observed on several occasions
that non-bailable warrants should not be issued, unless the accused
is charged with a heinous crime, and is likely to evade the process
of law or tamper/destroy evidence.30
47. Further, the observation that there is no provision for granting
exemption from personal appearance prior to obtaining bail, is not
correct, as the power to grant exemption from personal appearance
under the Code31 should not be read in a restrictive manner as
applicable only after the accused has been granted bail. This Court
in Maneka Sanjay Gandhi and Another v. Rani Jethmalani32
held that the power to grant exemption from personal appearance
should be exercised liberally, when facts and circumstances require
such exemption.33 Section 205 states that the Magistrate, exercising
his discretion, may dispense with the personal attendance of the
accused while issuing summons, and allow them to appear through
their pleader. While provisions of the Code are considered to be
exhaustive, cases arise where the Code is silent and the court has
to make such order as the ends of justice require. In such cases,
the criminal court must act on the principle, that every procedure
which is just and fair, is understood as permissible, till it is shown
to be expressly or impliedly prohibited by law.34
48. It is also directed that Manager Singh shall be released on bail by
the arresting officer/ investigating officer/trial court on the terms
and conditions to be fixed by the trial court in connection with the
chargesheet originating from FIR No. 556 of 2019. The direction
given by the High Court in its order dated 09.01.2020 restricting the
grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet is accordingly

warrants etc. by the court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate.

are quashed;

Pradesh on terms and conditions to be fixed by the trial court.
In addition, the appellants – Imran and Kamaluddin shall comply

Singh, with an order of remand to the Magistrate in terms

[Aniruddha Bose* and Sanjay Kumar, JJ.]","When can a litigant apply for modification of a judgment or an
order in a matter which stands finally concluded; and can a party
file an application after disposal of the statutory appeal by invoking
inherent powers of the Supreme Court.
","SUPREME COURT RULES, 2013 - Order XII, Rule 3 – Scope
thereof, explained – Filing of applications after disposal of
the statutory appeal:
Held: Impermissible – A post disposal application for modification
and clarification of an order shall lie only in rare cases, where the
order passed by the Supreme Court is executory in nature and
the directions of the Supreme Court have become impossible
to be implemented because of certain subsequent events or
developments – After disposal of an appeal / petition, the Supreme
Court becomes functus officio and does not retain jurisdiction to
entertain any application. [Para 20]
SUPREME COURT RULES, 2013 – Practice and Procedure –
Application projected as an application for clarification, though
it was registered as a miscellaneous application – Practice
deprecated.
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Order XXIII, Rule 1 – Scope
thereof, explained.
Held: There are two Orders in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013
which permit review of a judgment or an order of the Supreme
Court, Orders XLVII and XLVIII – The former Order, contained in
* Author
1024 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Part IV of the 2013 Rules, relates to “Review of a Judgment” and
the latter relates to “Curative Petition” – There is no other provision
in the 2013 Rules, whereby a litigant can apply for modification of
a judgment or an order of the Supreme Court in a matter which
stands finally concluded – By taking out a Miscellaneous Application,
the applicant cannot ask for reliefs which were not granted in the
main judgment itself. [Para 10]
Through this miscellaneous application, the applicant seeks a
direction upon the Rajasthan Discoms for making payment of
Rs.1376.35 crores – The present application has been captioned
as “APPLICATION FOR DIRECTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE
RESPONDENT NO.1/APPLICANT (ADANI POWER RAJASTHAN
LIMITED)” in the said appeals which stood disposed of by a
common judgment of a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court delivered on 31.08.2020 – Review petitions filed against
this judgment by the Rajasthan Discoms stood dismissed on
02.03.2021. [Para 2]
In the course of hearing, it was projected as an application for
clarification, though the same was registered as a miscellaneous
application – The reliefs asked for in this application do not refer
to any clarification. [Para 9]
The applicant had expressed its desire to withdraw the present
application on the last date of hearing, i.e., 24.01.2024 – The
Supreme Court, however, decided not to permit such simpliciter
withdrawal – Even if an applicant applies for withdrawal of an
application, in exceptional cases, it would be within the jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court to examine the application and pass appropriate
orders – So far as the present proceeding is concerned, an important
question of law has arisen as regards jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court to entertain an application taken out in connection with a set
of statutory appeals which stood disposed of – Judgment of the
Supreme Court in Supertech Limited v. Emerald Court Owner
Resident Welfare Association & Others, (2023) 10 SCC 817
deals with this question and the ratio of the said judgment would
apply to the present proceeding as well. [Para 19]
The Supreme Court becomes functus officio and does not retain
jurisdiction to entertain an application after the appeal was disposed
of by the judgment of a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court – This is not an application for correcting any clerical or
arithmetical error – Neither it is an application for extension of
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1025
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
time – A post disposal application for modification and clarification
of the order of disposal shall lie only in rare cases, where the
order passed by the Supreme Court is executory in nature and the
directions contained in the judgment may become impossible to
be implemented because of subsequent events or developments–
The factual background of this Application does not fit into that
description. [Para 20]
SUPREME COURT RULES, 2013 - Order XII, Rule 3 read with
Rule 6 of Order LV – Filing of applications after disposal of the
statutory appeal by invoking inherent powers of the Supreme
Court – Held, impermissible.
Held: The maintainability of the present application cannot be
explained by invoking the inherent power of the Supreme Court
either – The applicant has not applied for review of the main
judgment – In the contempt action, it failed to establish any wilful
disobedience of the main judgment and order – Now the applicant
cannot continue to hitchhike on the same judgment by relying on
the inherent power or jurisdiction of this Court. [Para 13]
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Section 152 read with Order XII,
Rule 3 of the SUPREME COURT RULES, 2013 – Rectification
of an arithmetic order – permissibility thereof.
Held: A miscellaneous application had been filed for modification
of the content of judgment dated 1st September 2020 passed
in M.A. (D) No. 9887 of 2020 in Civil Appeal Nos. 6328-6399
of 2015 – In the said proceeding, clarification was also sought
on the aspect that the judgment did not bar the Union of India
from considering and rectifying the clerical/arithmetical errors
in computation of certain dues – This was an order permitting
rectification of an arithmetic error, which is implicit in Section 152
of the CPC read with Order XII Rule 3 of the 2013 Rules. [Para 18]
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Section 148 read with Section
112 - Power of the Supreme Court to extend time.
Held: The power to extend time beyond that fixed by a Court on a
legitimate ground is incorporated in Section 148 of the CPC – If the
time to do something requires to be extended, it would be within
the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to go beyond the
maximum period of 30 days prescribed in the aforesaid Section,
after sufficient reason is shown – Section 112 of the Code itself
provides that nothing contained in the CPC shall affect the inherent
1026 [2024] 3 S.C.R.

powers of the Supreme Court under Article 136 or any other
provision of the Constitution. [Para 17]
SUPREME COURT RULES, 2013 - Order XII, Rule 3 – Imposition
of costs on filing of applications after disposal of the statutory
appeal.
Held: The Supreme Court dismissed the present application and
imposed costs of Rs. 50,000/- to be paid by the applicant to be
remitted to the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee as it was
listed several times. [Para 23]

","Judgment
Aniruddha Bose, J.
The applicant, Adani Power Rajasthan Limited (APRL), is a generating
company as per Section 2(28) of the Electricity Act, 2003 (“2003
Act”). It operates a thermal power plant in the State of Rajasthan.
There were three appellants (1 to 3) in the main set of appeals, in
connection with which the present application has been taken out,
being the distribution licensees of the State of Rajasthan as per the
provisions of the 2003 Act. They shall, henceforth in this judgment,
be collectively referred to as “Rajasthan Discoms”. Rajasthan Urja
Vikas Nigam Limited was the 4th appellant in the main set of appeals.
It appears to have been formed by the Government of Rajasthan for
the purpose of coordination among the aforesaid three Discoms, as
also other distribution licensees of the State.
2. Through this miscellaneous application, the applicant seeks a direction
upon the Rajasthan Discoms for making payment of Rs.1376.35
crore towards Late Payment Surcharge (“LPS”). This claim has been
raised by the applicant citing Article 8.3.5 of the Power Purchase
Agreement dated 28.01.2010 (“PPA-2010”) entered into between
the Rajasthan Discoms and the applicant. The present application
has been captioned as “APPLICATION FOR DIRECTIONS ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NO.1/APPLICANT (ADANI
POWER RAJASTHAN LIMITED)” in the said appeals which stood
disposed of by a common judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this
Court delivered on 31.08.2020. Review petitions filed against this
judgment by the Rajasthan Discoms stood dismissed on 02.03.2021.
3. The appeals arose out of a dispute involving certain additional
payments claimed by the applicant as per the PPA-2010. Under the
agreement, the applicant was to supply electricity to the Rajasthan
Discoms, which had to be generated by the applicant. For this
purpose, the PPA-2010 postulated domestic coal as the primary
source of energy, while imported coal was to be used as a backup
option. The applicant’s complaint was that, due to non-availability
of sufficient domestic coal, it could not be allocated a domestic coal
linkage by the Government of India and it was compelled to rely on
imported coal from Indonesia, which had a higher cost. Claim for
compensation of loss, caused on account of non-supply of domestic
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1029
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
coal, was raised by the applicant before the Rajasthan Electricity
Regulatory Commission (“RERC”), invoking the change in law clause
of the PPA-2010. Change in law was one of the conditions under
the PPA-2010, for which tariff adjustment payment could be made
by the seller of electricity following the procedure stipulated in the
aforesaid agreement. By an order dated 17.05.2018, RERC held
that the applicant would be entitled to relief on account of change
in law, which was held to be the difference between actual landed
cost of alternative/imported coal (as certified by the auditor) and
actual landed cost of domestic linkage coal. This was recorded in
an order passed on 25.02.2022 by a Coordinate Bench of this Court
in a contempt action brought by the applicant [Contempt Petition
(Civil) No(s) 877-878 of 2021]. We shall refer to the said proceeding
later in this judgment. We also need not delve into the question of
eligibility of the applicant to get additional sum on account of change
in law, as that question stands finally decided in the main judgment.
4. The applicant had also raised another claim for additional payment
before the RERC, under the head of carrying cost which was
disallowed by the RERC. Rajasthan Discoms, being aggrieved by
the grant of change-in-law compensation, as also the applicant, being
aggrieved by rejection of the claim for carrying costs appealed against
the order of the RERC before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity
(“APTEL”). By a common decision dated 14.09.2019, the APTEL
found that the applicant’s claim based on “change in law” was valid
and opined that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the
loss caused to it because of change in law under a subsequent coal
supply scheme, termed as the SHAKTI scheme, which failed to provide
domestic coal linkage. The APTEL further found that the applicant
would also be entitled for payment towards applicable carrying cost.
The Rajasthan Discoms had appealed against the common decision
of APTEL before this Court. The three-Judge Bench of this Court,
by the judgement dated 31.08.2020, dismissed the appeals with the
following observations and directions: -
“66. Considering the facts of this case and keeping in
view that the RERC and APTEL have given concurrent
findings in favour of the respondent with regard to change
in law, with which we also concur, we may now deal with
the question of liability of appellants-Rajasthan Discoms
with regard to late payment surcharge. In this regard, the
1030 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
following Articles 8.3.5 and 8.8 of PPA, which are relevant
for the present purpose, are extracted hereunder:
“8.3.5. In the event of delay in payment of a Monthly Bill
by the Procurers beyond its Due Date, a Late Payment
Surcharge shall be payable by such Procurers to the Seller
at the rate of two percent (2%) in excess of the applicable
SBAR per annum, on the amount of outstanding payment,
calculated on a day to day basis (and compounded with
monthly rest), for each day of the delay. The Late Payment
Surcharge shall be claimed by the Seller through the
Supplementary Bill.
8.8 Payment of Supplementary Bill
8.8.1 Either Party may raise a bill on the other Party
(supplementary bill) for payment on account of:
i) Adjustments required by the Regional Energy
Account (if applicable):
ii) Tariff Payment for change in parameters,
pursuant to provisions in Schedule 4; or
iii) Change in Law as provided in Article 10, and
such Supplementary Bill shall be paid by the
others party.
8.8.2 The Procurers shall remit all amounts due
under a Supplementary Bill raised by the Seller to
the Seller’s Designated Account by the Due Date and
notify the Seller of such remittance on the same day
or the Seller shall be eligible to draw such amounts
through the Letter of Credit. Similarly, the Seller shall
pay all amounts due under a Supplementary Bill
raised by Procurer(s) by the Due Date to concerned
Procurer’s designated bank account and notify such
Procurer(s) of such payment on the same day.
For such payments by the Procurer(s), Rebate as
applicable to Monthly Bills pursuant to Article 8.3.6
shall equally apply.
8.8.3 In the event of delay in payment of a
Supplementary Bill by either Party beyond its Due
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1031
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
Date, a Late Payment Surcharge shall be payable
at the same terms applicable to the Monthly Bill in
Article 8.3.5.
8.9 The copies of all; notices/offers which are required
to be sent as per the provisions of this Article 8, shall
be sent by a party, simultaneously to all parties.”
Liability of the Late Payment Surcharge which has been
saddled upon the appellants is at the rate of 2% in
excess of applicable SBAR per annum, on the amount of
outstanding payment, calculated on a day to day basis
(and compounded with monthly rest) for each day of the
delay. Therefore, there shall be huge liability of payment
of Late Payment Surcharge upon the appellants-Rajasthan
Discoms.
67. With regard to the question of interest/late payment
surcharge, we notice that the plea of change in law was
initially raised by APRL in the year 2013. A case was also
filed by APRL in the year 2013 itself raising its claim on
such basis. However, the appellants-Rajasthan Discoms
did not allow the claim regarding change in law, because
of which APRL was deprived of raising the bills with effect
from the date of change in law in the year 2013. We
are, thus, of the opinion that considering the totality of
the facts of this case and in order to do complete justice
and to reduce the liability of the appellants-Rajasthan
Discoms, payment of 2 per cent in excess of the applicable
SBAR per annum with monthly rest would be on higher
side. In our opinion, it would be appropriate to direct the
appellants-Rajasthan Discoms to pay interest/late payment
surcharge as per applicable SBAR for the relevant years,
which should not exceed 9 per cent per annum. It is also
provided that instead of monthly rest, the interest would
be compounded per annum.
68. We accordingly direct that the rate of interest/late
payment surcharge would be at SBAR, not exceeding 9
per cent per annum, to be compounded annually, and the
2 per cent above the SBAR (as provided in Article 8.3.5
of PPA) would not be charged in the present case.
1032 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
69. Before we part with the case, we may notice that
Shri Prashant Bhushan, raised the submission with
respect to over-invoicing. He attracted our attention to the
investigation pending before the DRI. He has submitted
that 40 importers of coal are under investigation by the DRI
concerning alleged over-invoicing. The letter of rogatory
was issued. However, leamed counsel conceded that there
is no ultimate conclusion in the investigation reached so far.
Thus, we are of the opinion that until and unless there is
a finding recorded by the competent court as to invoicing,
the submission cannot be accepted. At this stage, it cannot
be said that there is over-invoicing. We have examined
the case on merits with abundant caution, and we find
that there are concurrent findings of facts recorded by the
RERC and the APTEL. With respect to the aspect that
bid was premised on domestic coal, we find that findings
recorded do not call for any interference.”
5. The applicant had filed contempt proceedings alleging disobedience
of the said judgment and order, which were registered as Contempt
Petition (C) Nos. 877-878 of 2021. We have already referred to this
proceeding. In the contempt proceeding, the applicant’s position
gets reflected in the submissions of its learned senior counsel,
recorded in paragraph 6 of the order passed on 25.02.2022 (One
of us, Aniruddha Bose, J., was a party to this order). The relevant
portion of that order is reproduced below:-
“6. Shri Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioner has submitted that the only
dispute which was to be resolved by RERC, APTEL and
this Court was with regard to the payment due because of
“change in law”, which was held to be the actual landed
cost of alternate coal/imported coal as certified by the
auditor minus landed cost of domestic linkage coal. There
was no other dispute which was to be resolved by this
Court. Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that it is
now contended by the respondents that certain payments
have been made by the respondents which, according to
the learned Senior Counsel, was towards regular payment
on the basis of domestic linkage coal and nothing else.
Since, the “change in law” ground of the petitioner has been
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1033
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
accepted by all the authorities i.e. RERC, APTEL and this
Court and also confirmed by the dismissal of the Review
Petition filed before this Court, the question cannot now be
reopened at this stage. It is, thus, submitted that since the
actual landed cost of alternate coal/imported coal as was
submitted by the petitioner has been duly certified by the
auditors, which has not been disputed by the respondents,
the payment, as claimed, ought to have been made and
since the same has not been paid, the respondents are
liable for contempt. The further contention of the learned
Senior Counsel of the petitioner is that the claim of the
respondents that they had paid certain amount towards
energy charges regularly month by month, which included
certain amount of price of alternate coal/imported coal
charges cannot be accepted, as at that stage i.e. in the
year 2013, the respondents had not accepted the claim
of the petitioner with regard to “change in law”, and the
assertion now being made by the respondents that they had
paid certain amount after partially accepting the “change
in law” theory cannot be accepted, as this issue had never
been raised by respondents in any proceedings earlier, as
the respondents had, in fact, throughout contested that
the petitioner is not entitled to the “change in law” benefit.”
6. The allegations of non-compliance with the judgment of the three-
Judge Bench were dealt with by the Coordinate Bench in the aforesaid
order passed on 25.02.2022. It was, inter-alia, observed and directed
in the said order:-
“9. Firstly, what we have to consider is only the effect of
“change in law”, which as per RERC, API’EL and this Court
would be the actual landed cost of alternate coal/ imported
coal minus the landed cost of domestic linkage coal. The
question of any claim which the respondents may have
against the petitioner, is not an issue before us. As per the
principle laid down by RERC and affirmed up till this Court,
the petitioner has claimed an amount of Rs.5344. 75 crores
up to March, 2021. The said principle having been affirmed
by the APTEL as well as by this Court and even in Review
Petition, cannot be reopened now. It cannot be disputed
that after March, 2021 also, the petitioner would be entitled
1034 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
to payment on the basis of the same calculation, which up
to November, 2021 comes to Rs.130.69 crores. As such,
the due amount up to November 2021 would be Rs.5344.
75 + Rs.130.69 = 54 75.44 crores. Out of this amount of
Rs.54 75.44 crores, the petitioner has been paid a sum
of Rs.2426.81 crores in terms of the interim order passed
by this Court. Hence, as per the petitioner, the balance
amount of Rs.3048.63 crores would remain due to be
paid up to November, 2021. The interest at the maximum
rate of 9% per annum, as capped by this Court vide its
judgment and order dated 31.08.2020, is to be applied on
the said amount, from the date the amount became due,
till the date of actual payment. The further claim of late
payment surcharge, amounting to Rs.2477.70 crores, as
per the petitioner, would be a subject matter which the
petitioner, if so advised, can claim before the appropriate
forum, as the same is not the subject in question in the
present proceedings, regarding which no directions have
also been issued by this Court.
10. As such, considering the totality of facts and
circumstances of this case, prima face we are of the
opinion that the respondents are liable for contempt for
not complying this Court’s order dated 31.08.2020. We,
thus, direct the respondents to pay to the petitioner, the
principal amount (as per the terms/norms laid down in the
judgment of this Court dated 31.08.2020) minus Rs.2426.81
crores deposited by the respondents in terms of the interim
order dated 29.10.2018 (which, as per the petitioner, the
balance payable amount would be Rs.3048.63 crores)
along with interest as per the applicable SBAR for the
relevant years, which should not exceed 9% per annum
(to be compounded annually), from the date the amount
became due till the date of actual payment, within four
weeks from today, failing which the respondents shall
appear before this Court in person, on the next date, so
as to enable this Court to frame charges.”
7. The contempt petitions were subsequently directed to be closed by
another Coordinate Bench of this Court and order to that effect was
passed on 19.04.2022. In this order, it was, inter-alia, observed:-
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1035
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
“With regard to the first question it may only be observed
that by order dated 25.02.2022 passed in these contempt
petitions, this court, in paragraph no. 9, has observed as
under:
“The further claim of late payment surcharge,
amounting to Rs.2477.70 crores, as per the
petitioner, would be a subject matter which
the petitioner, if so advised, can claim before
the appropriate forum, as the same is not the
subject in question in the present proceedings,
regarding which no directions have also been
issued by this Court.”
As such, since according to the respondent(s) the payment
made is only towards the principal amount plus 9% interest
per annum, we are not inclined to pass any further orders
as we have already left the question of late payment
surcharge open, which the petitioner, if so advised, can
claim before the appropriate forum.
As regards the second question of the alleged non-
compliance, by the respondents after November, 2021
of the judgment and order dated 31.08.2020, we would
not like to make any observation as there is neither. any
material before us with regard to that nor the same was
in question when the contempt petitions were filed. As
such, we leave this question open to be agitated by the
petitioner, of it is so advised.
With regard to the last issue raised by the respondents,
which is to the effect that the claim of the Rajasthan
Utilities against the petitioner outside the judgment dated
31.08.2020 be permitted to be made, we would only like to
observe that the same cannot be a matter to be considered
in a contempt petition and as such neither we are inclined
to grant any such relief nor stop them from raising any
such issue, if the respondents are so advised and found
entitled under the law. With the aforesaid observations,
we close these contempt petitions.”
8. After institution of the present application on 19.07.2022, it was heard
from time to time and finally on 24.01.2024, when this matter was
1036 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
called on for hearing, Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior
counsel, appearing for the applicant, sought leave to withdraw the
application. Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel appearing for
the Rajasthan Discoms, however, opposed such prayer and his case
was that the present application, having been taken out in an appeal
which stood disposed of, did not lie and it should be dismissed on
the ground that it is not maintainable. Mr. Dave drew our attention
to paragraph 67 of the judgment of the three-Judge Bench, which
we have quoted above. The issue of LPS has been dealt with by
the three-Judge Bench in the said passage.
9. In the course of hearing, it was projected as an application for
clarification, though the same was registered as a miscellaneous
application. The reliefs asked for in this application do not refer to
any clarification. We have referred to the substance of the reliefs
prayed for in this application earlier in this judgment.
10. Order XII Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 (“2013 Rules”)
framed in pursuance of Article 145 of the Constitution of India,
stipulates:-
“3. Subject to the provisions contained in Order XLVII of
these rules, a judgment pronounced by the Court or by
a majority of the Court or by a dissenting Judge in open
Court shall not afterwards be altered or added to, save for
the purpose of correcting a clerical or arithmetical mistake
or an error arising from any accidental slip or omission.”
There are, however, two chapters in the 2013 Rules which permit
review of a judgment or order of this Court, being Order XLVII and
XLVIII. The former Order, contained in Part IV of the 2013 Rules
relates to “Review of a Judgment” and the latter relates to “Curative
Petition”. There is no other provision in the 2013 Rules, whereby a
litigant can apply for modification of a judgment or an order of this
Court in a matter which stands finally concluded. On rare occasions,
a litigant may apply for clarification of an order if the same is ex-facie
incomprehensible, but we do not expect any judgment or order to
bear such a character. So far as the applicant is concerned, it did
not apply for review of the judgment delivered by the three-Judge
Bench. Neither in the contempt action initiated by the applicant, did
this Court find that any case of willful disobedience of the judgment
of the three-Judge Bench was made out on the question of LPS.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1037
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
This would be apparent from the orders passed by this Court in
the contempt petitions which have been reproduced earlier in this
judgement. The judgment of the three-Judge Bench has already
examined the question of LPS and by taking out a Miscellaneous
Application, the applicant cannot ask for reliefs which were not
granted in the main judgment itself.
11. In the case of Ghanashyam Mishra & Sons Private Limited -vs-
Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited [M.A. No. 1166
of 2021 in CA No. 8129 of 2019], a two-Judge Bench of this Court
in its judgment delivered on 17th August 2022 observed and held:-
“4. Having heard learned senior counsel for the parties
and having perused the relevant materials placed on
record, we are of the considered view that the present
applications are nothing else but an attempt to seek review
of the judgment and order passed by this Court on 13th
April 2021 under the garb of miscellaneous application.
5. We find that there is a growing tendency of
indirectly seeking review of the orders of this Court
by filing applications either seeking modifications or
clarifications of the orders passed by this Court.
6. In our view, such applications are a total abuse of
process of law. The valuable time of Court is spent in
deciding such application which time would otherwise
be utilized for attending litigations of the litigants who
are waiting in the corridors of justice for decades
together.”
(emphasis supplied)
12. Subsequently in the judgment of this Court in the case of Supertech
Limited-vs- Emerald Court Owner Resident Welfare Association
& Others [(2023) 10 SCC 817], a two-Judge Bench of this Court
examined the maintainability of miscellaneous applications “for
clarification, modification or recall” and was pleased to observe the
following in the context of that case:-
“12. The attempt in the present miscellaneous application is
clearly to seek a substantive modification of the judgment
of this Court. Such an attempt is not permissible in a
miscellaneous application. While Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned
1038 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Senior Counsel has relied upon the provisions of Order
LV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, what is
contemplated therein is a saving of the inherent powers of
the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for
the ends of justice or to prevent an abuse of the process
of the Court. Order LV Rule 6 cannot be inverted to bypass
the provisions for review in Order XLVII of the Supreme
Court Rules, 2013. The miscellaneous application is an
abuse of the process.”
The authorities which were cited in the said Judgment by the
Coordinate Bench are the cases of State (UT of Delhi) -vs- Gurdip
Singh Uban and Others [(2000) 7 SCC 296], Sone Lal and Others
-vs- State of Uttar Pradesh [(1982) 2 SCC 398], Ram Chandra
Singh -vs- Savitri Devi and Others [(2004 12 SCC 713], Common
Cause -vs- Union of India and Others [(2004) 5 SCC 222], Zahira
Habibullah Sheikh and Another -vs- State of Gujarat and Others
[(2004) 5 SCC 353], P.N. Eswara Iyer and Others -vs- Registrar,
Supreme Court of India [(1980) 4 SCC 680], Suthendraraja alias
Suthenthira Raja alias Santhan and Others -vs- State through
DSP/CBI, SIT, Chennai [(1999) 9 SCC 323], Ramdeo Chauhan
alias Raj Nath -vs- State of Assam [(2001) 5 SCC 714], Devendra
Pal Singh -vs- State (NCT of Delhi) and Another [(2003) 2 SCC
501] and Rashid Khan Pathan in re, [(2021) 12 SCC 64]. These
authorities broadly stipulate that multiple attempts to reopen a
judgment of this Court should not be permitted. Hence, we do not
consider it necessary to deal with these authorities individually.
13. Rule 6 of Order LV of the 2013 Rules stipulates: -
“6. Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court to make
such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice
or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.”
The maintainability of the present application cannot be explained by
invoking the inherent power of this Court either. The applicant has
not applied for review of the main judgment. In the contempt action,
it failed to establish any willful disobedience of the main judgment
and order on account of non-payment of LPS. Now the applicant
cannot continue to hitchhike on the same judgment by relying on
the inherent power or jurisdiction of this Court.
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1039
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
14. Appearing on behalf of the applicant, Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior
Counsel, relied on five orders of this Court in which post-disposal
applications were entertained. The first one was an order dated
29.10.2018 in the case of Energy Watchdog -vs- Central Electricity
Regulatory Commission and Others, [MA Nos.2705-2706 of 2018
in Civil Appeal Nos.5399-5400 of 2016]. In that case, an application
for impleadment on behalf of the State of Gujarat was allowed, upon
going through a High Power Committee’s report, which was given
after the judgment was delivered. The judgment disposing of the
Civil Appeal was delivered on 11.04.2017, but in the miscellaneous
application, the applicant was given liberty to approach the Central
Electricity Regulatory Commission for approval of the proposed
amendments to be made to a power purchase agreement. That
was a case where this Court, after the judgment was delivered,
considered certain events which accrued subsequently and had a
bearing on the main decision. The subsequent event was taken into
account for modifying the order but there was no substantive change
in the judgment itself.
15. The next order, on which Dr. Singhvi placed reliance, was passed
on 04.05.2023 in the case of Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd.
& Anr. -vs- Adani Power (Mundra) Limited [MA (D) No. 18461 of
2023 in Civil Appeal No.2908 of 2022]. The substantive part of the
order is contained in Paragraph 2 thereof and this paragraph reads:-
“2. As agreed by the learned counsel for the parties, the
words “As per the details given in the PPA, the mode of
transportation is through railway” shown in paragraph 32
of the judgment dated 20.04.2023 passed in C.A. No. 2908
of 2022 be read as “As per the details given in the FSA,
the mode of transportation is through railway”.
But this order appears to be in the nature of correcting an error
which was clerical in nature and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(“the Code”) itself provides for such correction under Section 152
thereof, as also Order XII Rule 3 of the 2013 Rules.
16. The third order relied on by Dr. Singhvi was passed on 09.12.2022 in
the case of Kalpataru Properties Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Indiabulls Housing
Finance Ltd. [MA No.2064 of 2022 in Civil Appeal No.7050 of 2022].
The applicant therein had approached this Court contending that he
was not heard when the civil appeal was decided. In that case, the
1040 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
appellant had approached this Court against an Order passed by
NCLAT in Company Appeal (AT)(Insolvency) No. 880/2021 and the
said appellant sought to withdraw the appeal on deposit of certain
amount by the first respondent in the said appeal. The request was
accepted by this Court and by the Order passed on 26.09.2022, the
appeal pending before the NCLAT was also disposed of by this Court.
The applicant was an intervenor before the NCLAT and his submission
was that in the appeal before the NCLAT which was disposed of,
he also sought to raise some grievances before the NCLAT, in his
capacity as an intervenor. His case was that he should have been
given the liberty to be heard as an intervenor before the NCLAT. A
Coordinate Bench of this Court entertained that application and held: -
“We do believe that this controversy should be resolved
by the NCLAT itself i.e. whether on the appellants seeking
to withdraw the appeal, there can be any impediment in
withdrawal of the appeal and is the NCLAT really required
to comment on the merits of the order of the NCLT at the
behest of an intervener. We further make it clear that we
are not expanding the array of parties before the NCLAT
as a number of entities seems to have jumped into the
picture as the matter has gone on before the Court. We
make it clear that only the parties/existing interventionist
before the NCLAT will have the right of hearing.
In view of the orders passed in Civil Appeal No. 9062/2022,
this appeal will also to be listed before the Bench presided
over by the Chairman.
In view thereof, the final picture which would emerge would
be before the NCLAT and to that extent the order passed
by us on 14.11.2022 would be kept in abeyance till the
NCLAT resolves the issue.”
Again, this Order was in the nature of a review order by the applicant
who was a party to the proceeding before the NCLAT. All the appeals
before the NCLAT were disposed of without hearing him. The context
is entirely different from the one in which the applicant has presently
approached this Court.
17. The fourth order on which the present applicant relied was passed
on 12.08.2022 in the case of Supertech Limited -vs- Emerald
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1041
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
Court Owner Resident Welfare Association & Ors. [MA No.1918
of 2021 in Civil Appeal No.5041 of 2021]. The Coordinate Bench
of this Court granted extension of time, as sought by the applicant
therein, in effecting demolition of two building towers which were
approved by the Court while disposing of the civil appeal. The power
to extend time beyond that fixed by a Court on a legitimate ground is
incorporated in Section 148 of the Code. If the time to do something
requires to be extended, it would be within the inherent jurisdiction of
this Court to go beyond the maximum period of 30 days prescribed
in the aforesaid Section, after sufficient reason is shown. Section
112 of the Code itself provides that nothing contained in the Code
shall affect the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article
136 or any other provision of the Constitution.
18. The fifth order referred to by the applicant was passed on 23.07.2021
in the case of Union of India -vs- Association of Unified Telecom
Service Providers of India and Ors. [MA No.83 of 2021 in MA
(D) No. 9887 of 2020 in Civil Appeal No.6328-6399 of 2015]. A
miscellaneous application had been filed for modification of the
content of judgment dated 1st September 2020 passed in M.A. (D)
No. 9887 of 2020 in Civil Appeal Nos. 6328-6399 of 2015. In the
said proceeding, clarification was also sought on the aspect that
the judgment did not bar the Union of India from considering and
rectifying the clerical/arithmetical errors in computation of certain
dues. This was again an Order, in substance, permitting rectification
of an arithmetic error, which is implicit in Section 152 of the Code
read with Order XII Rule 3 of the 2013 Rules.
19. We have indicated in the earlier part of this judgment that Dr. Singhvi
had expressed his desire to withdraw the present application on
the last date of hearing, i.e., 24.01.2024. Ordinarily, we would not
have had set out the background leading to the filing of the present
application and the course of the application that was taken before
this Court in view of such submission. Any plaintiff would be entitled
to abandon a suit or abandon part of the claim made in the suit at
any time after institution of the suit, as provided in Rule 1 of Order
XXIII of the Code. We, however, decided not to permit such simpliciter
withdrawal, as the Rajasthan Discoms sought imposition of costs.
Secondly, in our opinion, the provision which pertains to a suit would
not ipso facto apply to a miscellaneous application invoking inherent
powers of this Court, instituted in a set of statutory appeals which
1042 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
stood disposed of. Even if an applicant applies for withdrawal of an
application, in exceptional cases, it would be within the jurisdiction
of the Court to examine the application and pass appropriate orders.
So far as the present proceeding is concerned, an important question
of law has arisen as regards jurisdiction of the Court to entertain an
application taken out in connection with a set of statutory appeals
which stood disposed of. Judgment of this Court in Supertech
Limited (supra) deals with this question and in our opinion, the ratio
of the said judgment would apply to the present proceeding as well.
20. We felt it necessary to examine the question about maintainability of
the present application as we are of the view that it was necessary
to spell out the position of law as to when such post-disposal
miscellaneous applications can be entertained after a matter is
disposed of. This Court has become functus officio and does not
retain jurisdiction to entertain an application after the appeal was
disposed of by the judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this Court
on 31.08.2020 through a course beyond that specified in the statute.
This is not an application for correcting any clerical or arithmetical
error. Neither it is an application for extension of time. A post disposal
application for modification and clarification of the order of disposal
shall lie only in rare cases, where the order passed by this Court
is executory in nature and the directions of the Court may become
impossible to be implemented because of subsequent events or
developments. The factual background of this Application does not
fit into that description.
21. Our attention was drawn to an order passed on 14.12.2022 in which
a Coordinate Bench was of the prima facie opinion that the applicant
may be entitled to LPS as per Article 8.3.5 of PPA-2010, at least
from 31.08.2020, till the actual payment was made pursuant to the
order passed by this Court in the contempt proceedings. This prima
facie view was expressed in the course of hearing of the present
application only. We have examined the issue in greater detail. As
we have already indicated, the applicant, after the three-Judge Bench
decision was delivered, did not file any petition for review. On the
other hand, it was the Rajasthan Discoms that had filed the review
petitions which stood dismissed. In the contempt action instituted by
the applicant, the question concerning payment of LPS was raised,
but the Bench of this Court found that the same was not the subject
in question in the contempt proceedings regarding which no direction
[2024] 3 S.C.R. 1043
Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. & Ors. v.
Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. & Anr.
had been issued by this Court. Hence the Coordinate Bench decided
not to address that question in the contempt proceedings. In this
judgement, we have already quoted the observations regarding the
question of LPS made by the Contempt Court on 25.02.2022 and
19.04.2022. Despite that question being left open by the Contempt
Court, we are of the view that a miscellaneous application is not the
proper legal course to make demand on that count. A relief of this
nature cannot be asked for in a miscellaneous application which was
described in the course of hearing as an application for clarification.
22. So far as the observations made in the order passed in the present
proceedings on 14.12.2022 are concerned, they were made only at
a prima facie stage and do not have binding effect at the hearing
stage. Moreover, the question whether such a prayer could be made
in an application labeled as a “Miscellaneous Application” taken
out in connection with a set of appeals which have been finally
decided, does not appear to have been considered by this Court at
the time of making of the order dated 14.12.2022. The order of this
Court does not reflect any discussion on the issue of maintainability
of the present application. It also does not appear to us that the
maintainability issue was raised at that stage. Thus, mere making
of such observations cannot be construed to mean that this Court
found such application to be maintainable.
23. We, accordingly, dismiss the present application. This application was
listed before us on several occasions and for that reason we impose
costs of Rs. 50,000/- to be paid by the applicant to be remitted to
the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.

(Civil Appeal No. 7247 of 2024)
08 July 2024
[Abhay S. Oka* and Pankaj Mithal, JJ.]","In the instant case, issue revolves around the power of the
Appellate Court dealing with the appeal under Section 37(1)(c)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to pass an order of
remand to Section 34 Court.
","Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.34 and s.37 – An
award was passed by the Tribunal – Appellant filed a petition
u/s. 34 of the Arbitration Act before the High Court to challenge
the award – The Single Judge of the High Court allowed the
petition u/s. 34 and proceeded to set aside the award on various
grounds, such as perversity, patent illegality, etc. – Appeal by
the respondent u/s. 37 of the Arbitration Act challenging the
judgment of the single Judge of the High Court –The Division
Bench of the High Court passed an order of remand to the
single Judge on the ground that the single Judge of the High
Court did not consider several issues – Correctness:
Held: In the facts of the case in hand, while deciding the petition
under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the Single Judge has made
a very elaborate consideration of the submissions made across the
Bar, the findings recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal and the issue of
illegality or perversity of the award – Detailed reasons while dealing
with the alleged patent illegalities associated with the directions
issued under the arbitral award have been recorded – Considering
the nature of the findings recorded by the Single Judge, the job
of the Appellate Court was to scrutinise the said findings and to
decide, one way or the other, on merits – In this case, the finding
of the Appellate Bench that the impugned judgment of the Single
Judge does not address several issues raised by the parties cannot
* Author
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 137
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
be sustained at all – As far as the power of the Appellate Court
under Section 37(1)(c) to pass an order of remand is concerned,
the Appellate Court can exercise the power of remand only when
exceptional circumstances make an order of remand unavoidable –
Some of the exceptional cases can be stated by way of illustration:
a) Summary disposal of a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act is made without consideration of merits; b) Without service of
notice to the respondent in a petition under Section 34, interference
is made with the award; and c) Decision in proceedings under
Section 34 is rendered when one or more contesting parties are
dead, and their legal representatives have not been brought on
record – In the facts of the case, the remand was completely
unwarranted – The reason is that the Single Judge has elaborately
dealt with the merits of the challenge in the Section 34 petition –
This Court should benefit from reasoned judgment rendered by
the Court under Section 37 – In the instant case, this Court does
not have the benefit of a decision of the Appellate Court dealing
with all the issues dealt with by the Single Judge while deciding
the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act – Therefore,
the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court
is set aside and the Divison Bench of the High Court is directed
to decide the appeal on merits after considering the arbitral award
and the decision under section 34. [Paras 17, 18, 20 ]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 34 and s.37 –
Jurisdiction of the Appellate Court dealing with an appeal u/s.
37 against the judgment in a petition u/s. 34:
Held: The jurisdiction of the Appellate Court dealing with an appeal
under Section 37 against the judgment in a petition under Section
34 is more constrained than the jurisdiction of the Court dealing
with a petition under Section 34 – It is the duty of the Appellate
Court to consider whether Section 34 Court has remained confined
to the grounds of challenge that are available in a petition under
Section 34 – The ultimate function of the Appellate Court under
Section 37 is to decide whether the jurisdiction under Section
34 has been exercised rightly or wrongly – While doing so, the
Appellate Court can exercise the same power and jurisdiction that
Section 34 Court possesses with the same constraints. [Para 16]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s. 34, s.37 and s.19 –
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Applicability of the provisions
138 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of CPC to the proceedings before the Arbitrator and the Court
under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act:
Held: The provisions of the CPC have not been made applicable
to the proceedings before the learned Arbitrator and the Court
under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act – The legislature’s
intention is reflected in Section 19(1) of the Arbitration Act, which
provides that an Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the provision of
the CPC – That is why the provisions of the CPC have not been
made applicable to the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37(1)
(c). [Para 18]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Object of:
Held: The object of the Arbitration Act is to provide an arbitral
procedure that is fair, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs
of specific arbitration – The object is to ensure that the arbitral
proceedings and proceedings filed for challenging the award
are concluded expeditiously – The proceedings have to be cost-
effective – The supervisory role of the Courts is very restricted –
Moreover, one cannot ignore that arbitration is one of the modes
of Alternative Disputes Redressal Mechanism provided in Section
89 of the CPC. [Para 19]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – s.37 – Consequences
of passing routinely order of remand:
Held: If the Courts dealing with appeals under Section 37 of
the Arbitration Act start routinely passing the orders of remand,
the arbitral procedure will cease to be efficient – It will cease to
be cost-effective – Such orders will delay the conclusion of the
proceedings, thereby defeating the very object of the Arbitration
Act – Therefore, an order of remand by Section 37 Court can be
made only in exceptional cases where remand is unavoidable.
[Para 19]
Constitution of India – Art.136 – Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 – s. 34 and s.37:
Held: An order of remand by Section 37 Court can be made only
in exceptional cases where remand is unavoidable – The scope
of interference in a petition under Section 34 is very narrow – The
jurisdiction under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act is narrower –
Looking to the objects of the Arbitration Act and the limited scope
available to the Courts to interfere with the award of the Arbitral
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 139
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
Tribunal, this Court, while dealing with the decisions under Sections
34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act, in its jurisdiction under Article 136
of the Constitution of India, has to be circumspect – By their own
volition, the parties choose to go before the Arbitral Tribunal instead
of availing remedy before the traditional civil courts – Therefore,
the Courts must be very conservative when dealing with arbitral
awards and confine themselves to the grounds strictly available
under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. [Para 19]
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 – Bulky pleadings –
Time-consuming submissions, leading to very lengthy awards
– Bar to show restraint:
Held: The arbitral proceedings have become synonymous with
very bulky pleadings and evidence and very long, time-consuming
submissions, leading to very lengthy awards – Moreover, there is
a tendency to rely upon a large number of precedents, relevant
or irrelevant – The result of all this is that there are very long
hearings before the Courts in Sections 34 and 37 proceedings –
In many cases, the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 are
being treated as if the same are appeals under Section 96 of
the CPC – When members of the bar take up so many grounds
in petitions under Section 34, which are not covered by Section
34, there is a tendency to urge all those grounds which are not
available in law and waste the Court’s time – The members of the
Bar should show restraint by incorporating only legally permissible
grounds in petitions under Section 34 and the appeals under
Section 37 – Brevity will make the arbitral proceedings and the
proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 more effective – Arbitration
must become a tool for expeditious, effective, and cost-effective
dispute resolution. [Para 23]

Leave granted.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 141
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
FACTUAL ASPECTS
2. These appeals take exception to the same judgment and order dated
7th July 2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
Therefore, the same are being decided together. We are setting out
a few factual aspects necessary for deciding the appeals.
3. On 31st March 1993, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development
Authority (MHADA) executed a lease agreement in respect of the
subject property in favour of Andheri Kamgar Nagar Co-operative
Housing Society Limited (for short, ‘the Society’). It is stated to be
a society of slum dwellers. The Society, by the agreement dated 6th
October 1996, appointed M/s. Aurora Properties and Investments (for
short, ‘M/s. Aurora’) as the property developer to implement a slum
rehabilitation scheme. M/s. Aurora was to construct 237 rehabilitation
tenements for slum dwellers and 40 tenements for project-affected
persons (PAPs) free of cost and develop the property using the
available Floor Space Index (FSI) and dispose of the same. It appears
that M/s. Aurora could not discharge its obligations. Therefore, by the
agreement dated 22nd September 1999 (described as an agreement
for the grant of sub-development rights), the society appointed Bombay
Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited (the appellant) as
the developer. Apart from taking over the obligations of M/s. Aurora
under the development agreement dated 6th October 1996, the
appellant corporation agreed to hand over 15,000 square feet of built-
up area in the redeveloped property to M/s.Aurora against M/s. Aurora
paying the cost of construction at Rs.600 per square foot. After that,
the appellant started the development of the property. On 10th March
2003, an agreement was executed by and between the appellant
and one Samir Narain Bhojwani (the respondent), under which the
appellant retained 45% of the total available FSI and permitted the
respondent to construct the free sale area by allotting him FSI to the
extent of the remaining 55%. According to the appellant’s case, the
respondent was appointed as a contractor to carry out the construction
activities of the said building on the site. On 3rd July 2004, a deed
of confirmation was executed to register the agreement dated 10th
March 2003. Thereafter, on 11th September 2009, there was a letter/
tripartite agreement executed, to which M/s. Aurora, the appellant
and the respondent were parties under which it was agreed that the
appellant would provide 22,500 square feet of constructed area to
142 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
M/s. Aurora instead of 15,000 square feet, which was agreed to be
allotted under the agreement dated 22nd September 1999.
4. The dispute began on 22nd March 2012 when the respondent,
by his letter, alleged default against the appellant as set out in
the said letter. After the letter was sent, there was a prolonged
correspondence, exchange of drafts of the sale agreements, etc.
Ultimately, the respondent filed a petition before the High Court
under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for
short, ‘the Arbitration Act’). An Arbitrator was appointed. The arbitral
proceedings concluded in the form of an award made by the Arbitral
Tribunal on 7th September 2018 in favour of the respondent (the
claimant before the Arbitral Tribunal). Most of the claims made by the
respondent were granted. The counter-claim made by the appellant
was rejected. The appellant filed a petition under Section 34 of the
Arbitration Act before the High Court to challenge the award. By the
judgment dated 13th September 2019, the learned Single Judge of the
High Court allowed the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act
and proceeded to set aside the award on various grounds, such as
perversity, patent illegality, etc. The respondent filed an appeal under
Section 37(1)(c) of the Arbitration Act to challenge the judgment of the
learned Single Judge. By the impugned judgment, which set aside
the judgment of the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench of the
High Court passed an order of remand to the learned Single Judge
on the ground that the learned Single Judge did not consider several
issues. The Division Bench referred to an application made by the
third parties. It directed that the interim arrangements made earlier
by making an appointment of the Court Receiver shall continue for
four weeks with a liberty to the parties to seek appropriate interim
orders in the restored petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act. Both the parties to the appeal under Section 37 have preferred
these cross-appeals.
SUBMISSIONS
5. We have heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the parties in
these appeals. The learned senior counsel representing the appellant
submitted that an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act
is essentially a continuation of the proceedings under Section 34.
The scope of interference in an appeal under Section 37(1)(c) is
narrower than what is available under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act. Reliance was placed on various decisions of this Court in
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 143
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
support of the said submissions. Another contention is that while
deciding the appeal under Section 37(1)(c), the Court can either set
aside the award or affirm the award but cannot remand the petition
under Section 34 for a fresh hearing. The submission is that the
provisions of Order XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for
short, ‘the CPC’) concerning remand do not apply to an appeal
under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as the provisions of the
CPC do not apply to such an appeal. Inviting our attention to the
findings recorded by the learned Single Judge, the learned senior
counsel submitted that while allowing the petition under Section
34 of the Arbitration Act, the learned Single Judge, by a detailed
judgment, has dealt with all the issues canvassed by the parties.
Pointing out the findings recorded by the Division Bench in the
impugned judgment, he submitted that it cannot be said that the
reasons recorded by the learned Single Judge are not elaborate.
The reasons are very detailed and more than elaborate. In short,
the submission is that the remand order is wholly unwarranted,
and the Division Bench ought to have decided the appeal under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act on merits.
6. The appellant was the respondent before the Arbitral Tribunal. Even
the claimant Samir Narain Bhojwani (described in this judgment
as the respondent) has filed the Civil Appeal arising out of Special
Leave Petition (C) No.20359 of 2023. The intervenor before the
Division Bench in the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act
has preferred a Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C)
Diary No.40494 of 2023. The plea by the respondent is naturally for
restoration of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal. We have heard the
detailed submissions of the learned senior counsel representing the
respondent (the claimant) and the intervenors. We are not referring
to the submissions made by them relating to the merits of the Award,
considering the limited scope of these appeals.
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS
7. After considering the submissions made across the Bar, we find that
the issue revolves around the power of the Appellate Court dealing
with the appeal under Section 37(1)(c) of the Arbitration Act to pass
an order of remand to Section 34 Court. Before we address the issue
regarding the power of the Appellate Court, we will need to refer
to the award made by the Arbitral Tribunal. There are six different
144 [2024] 7 S.C.R.

parts of the award by the Arbitral Tribunal. The operative part of the
award of the Arbitral Tribunal reads thus:

8. While deciding the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the
learned Single Judge has made an in-depth discussion on the factual
aspects and the submissions of the learned counsel representing
the parties. Paragraphs 1 to 35 of his judgment deal with the factual
aspects and details about the directions issued by the Arbitral Tribunal
under the award. Paragraphs 36 to 125, spanning over 45 pages,
record the submissions made by the parties, and paragraphs 126
to 194, covering 37 pages, are the reasons recorded by the learned
Single Judge. There is a discussion about the oral and documentary
evidence adduced by the parties. From paragraphs 140 onwards,
the learned Single Judge discussed the issue of jurisdiction of the
Arbitral Tribunal to pass the award against the third parties who were
not parties to the arbitral proceedings. The learned Single Judge
referred to the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that 31 agreements/
allotment letters for the sale of flats were sham and bogus and were
not binding on the respondent. The learned Single Judge found that
no persons shown as purchasers under the agreement were parties
to the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal. The learned Single
Judge also noted that these 31 flats were mortgaged in favour of
various Banks and Financial Institutions. Therefore, the learned Single
Judge held that even the Banks and Financial Institutions would be
affected by the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that 31 flats under the
sale agreements were sham, bogus, null, and void. Therefore, the
learned Single Judge held that the Arbitral Tribunal had exceeded its
jurisdiction. The learned Single Judge also held that the respondent
before the Arbitral Tribunal (the appellant herein) was entitled to sell
the said 31 flats, and the purchasers thereof were neither parties to
the agreement containing the arbitration clause nor claiming under
the said agreement.
9. The learned Single Judge also referred to that part of the arbitral
award, which provided that there would be a charge over the flats
held by the appellant herein. The learned Single Judge held that
150 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
the charge on the properties could be either created by operation of
law or by agreement of the parties, and in this case, there was no
such agreement. Therefore, the learned Single Judge held that the
direction to create the charge was ex-facie without the jurisdiction.
Thereafter, the learned Single Judge referred to the reliefs granted
by the Arbitral Tribunal in clauses (c) to (l), (m) to (q), (t), (u) and
(v) of paragraph 203 of the award. According to the learned Single
Judge, some of the reliefs could have been granted only in the
execution of the award. Further, the learned Single Judge held that
under clauses (c) to (l) and (m) to (q) of paragraph 203 of the award,
the appellant herein was directed to carry out various acts to obtain
multiple permissions from the authorities within the prescribed time
and based on such compliance, further directions were issued for the
execution of multiple documents, etc. The authorities from whom the
appellant was directed to obtain various permissions were admittedly
not parties before the arbitral proceedings. The learned Single Judge
also noted that the directions issued in the abovementioned clauses
required continuous supervision by the Court. Therefore, in view of
the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, such reliefs ought
not to have been granted by the Arbitral Tribunal.
10. The learned Single Judge also held that though specific performance
was sought in the claim made before the Arbitral Tribunal based
on the Letter of Intent dated 7th March 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal
granted specific performance based on the Letter of Intent of 2010.
The learned Single Judge also held that the learned Arbitrator or
the Court could not supervise whether the appellant can shift 107
PAPs in its other properties as directed under the award. Further, it
was observed that the direction to construct the 6th to 22nd floors
could be implemented only upon completing the entire chain of
events, such as obtaining permissions, shifting of PAPs, etc. The
learned Single Judge held that the grant of specific performance in
the present case would be hit by Section 14 of the Specific Relief
Act, 1963, as the enforcement of such a contract involves continuous
supervision by the Court. On perusing the material on record, the
learned Single Judge also held that the respondent herein had not
proved his readiness and willingness to perform his obligations. The
learned Single Judge held that since the relief of specific performance
is discretionary, the conduct of the respondent ought to have been
taken into consideration by the Arbitral Tribunal.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 151
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
11. The learned Single Judge dealt with the award of damages in the
sum of Rs.53 crores for the period from 19th July 2016 till the date
of the award on account of the alleged delay by the respondent.
The learned Single Judge held that the evidence on record had
been completely overlooked while granting the relief of damages
in the sum of Rs.53 crores. The learned Single Judge recorded
that the Arbitral Tribunal referred to only a part of the depositions
of the witnesses and ignored the rest. Further, the learned Single
Judge held that the delay on the part of the appellant in completing
other projects was neither pleaded nor proved. Moreover, the
learned Single Judge held that even assuming that there was a
delay in completion of other projects on the part of the appellant,
that would be no ground for grant of relief for specific performance.
The learned Single Judge recorded something about the approach
of the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 168. The learned Single Judge
objected to the learned Arbitrator relying on the news report of
some other developer’s project in the Times of India. The learned
Single Judge noted that the news article was published after the
arguments were concluded. Moreover, the learned Single Judge
found that relying upon the material, not forming part of the record,
amounts to a breach of the principles of natural justice. A clear
finding recorded by the learned Single Judge is that the learned
Arbitrator has applied different yardsticks to the evidence adduced
by both parties. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal did not treat the
parties as equals.
12. The learned Judge held that while dealing with the per square
feet rate of the flats for awarding a claim for damages, the Arbitral
Tribunal completely ignored the evidence on record, which showed
that the respondent had sold the flats at much lower rates. The
learned Single Judge also discussed the finding recorded while
rejecting the counterclaim. The learned Single Judge held that
though the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the building did not
have a load-bearing capacity of 22 floors, the respondent neither
pleaded nor proved the load-bearing capacity of the building. The
learned Single Judge also held that awarding payment of interest
on interest-free deposit was contrary to the terms of the contract,
which shows patent illegality. However, the learned Single Judge
rejected the allegation of bias made by the appellant against the
learned Arbitrator.
152 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
13. We have referred to only material findings of the learned Single Judge
by way of illustration to emphasise that there is a very elaborate
consideration of the merits of the challenge to the award in the
judgment of the learned Single Judge.
14. Now, we turn to the judgment of the Division Bench in the appeal
under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The approach of the Division
Bench is reflected in paragraph 4 of the impugned judgment, which
reads thus:
“4. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,
we were of the opinion that the impugned order is
required to be set aside and the matter needs to be
remanded to the learned Single Judge for de novo
consideration. We had put it to the counsel for the
parties that the appeal can be remanded, without
detailed reasons, by consent, keeping all contentions
open. The Appellant was ready but the Respondent was
not ready. Therefore, we are required to give elaborate
reason why remand is necessary. In this context, we
have briefly referred to the core facts of the case, the rival
contentions, the award and the impugned order. The factual
backdrop leading to the dispute is narrated in detail in the
Award and by the learned Single Judge. The summary of
the factual position is as follows.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..”
(emphasis added)
In paragraphs 42 and 43, the Division Bench held thus:
“42. Even otherwise, question would arise as to
whether such a detailed factual enquiry can be made
to set aside the award. To reach such a conclusion
that it suffers from perversity, the Award had to be
carefully analyzed to rule out other possibilities. It is
not enough to merely state a conclusion. Further, when
such a conclusion can be reached under Section 34 of the
Act is a debatable issue that also needs to be addressed.
43. In the impugned order in paragraphs 161 and 162
reference is made to the principle of law governing the
discretion to be used for grant of specific performance.
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 153
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
In paragraph 163, it is stated that ‘perusal of the record’
will indicate that the Appellant has not proved that he
was ready and willing. When the Appellant sought to
argue that the Appellant was ready and willing, the
same was dealt with in paragraph 164. The submission
of the Appellant that unless the Respondent would
have fully satisfied the Appellant that he had made
appropriate provision for shifting 107 PAPs to some
other plot the Appellant was not required to proceed
with the construction of building, was not accepted.
However, there is no discussion as to why this stand
of the Appellant was rejected.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . .. .. … ..”
(emphasis added)
In the impugned judgment, certain findings recorded by the learned
Single Judge have been criticised. Ultimately, in paragraphs 61 and
62 of the impugned judgment, the Division Bench held thus:
“61. Considering that the impugned order has not
addressed several issues raised by both parties before
setting aside the Award, for the above reasons we are
inclined to set aside the impugned order to remand the
proceedings to the learned Single Judge. Further under
the Award itself. question now will remain for damages.
62. Since we are of the opinion that the petition filed by
the Respondent needs to be reconsidered, we refrain from
going deeper into the controversy and in our discussion,
which have only highlighted as to why the impugned order
is unreasoned and therefore needs to be set aside for
reconsideration.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..”
Thus, eventually, an order of remand was passed directing the
learned Single Judge to hear the petition under Section 34 afresh.
15. We need not dwell on the limited scope of the interference in the
petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. That position is very
well settled. However, as far as the appeal under Section 37(1)(c)
154 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of the Arbitration Act is concerned, in the case of MMTC Limited v.
Vedanta Limited 1, in paragraph 14, this Court held thus:
“14. As far as interference with an order made under
Section 34, as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot
be disputed that such interference under Section 37
cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under
Section 34. In other words, the court cannot undertake
an independent assessment of the merits of the award,
and must only ascertain that the exercise of power
by the court under Section 34 has not exceeded the
scope of the provision. Thus, it is evident that in case
an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under
Section 34 and by the court in an appeal under Section
37, this Court must be extremely cautious and slow to
disturb such concurrent findings.”
(emphasis added)
In another decision of this Court in the case of UHL Power Company
Limited v. State of Himachal Pradesh 2, in paragraph 16, it was
held thus:
“16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when
it comes to the scope of an appeal under Section 37 of
the Arbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court
in examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set
aside an award, is all the more circumscribed. In MMTC
Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4
SCC 163 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 293] , the reasons for vesting
such a limited jurisdiction on the High Court in exercise of
powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act have been
explained in the following words : (SCC pp. 166-67, para 11)
“11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the
position is well-settled by now that the Court
does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and
may interfere on merits on the limited ground
1 [2019] 3 SCR 1023 : (2019) 4 SCC 163
2 [2022] 1 SCR 1 : (2022) 4 SCC 116
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 155
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
provided under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the
award is against the public policy of India. As per
the legal position clarified through decisions of
this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996
Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy,
in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental
policy of Indian law, a violation of the interest
of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the
existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award.
Additionally, the concept of the “fundamental
policy of Indian law” would cover compliance
with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a
judicial approach, compliance with the principles
of natural justice, and Wednesbury [Associated
Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury
Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)] reasonableness.
Furthermore, “patent illegality” itself has been
held to mean contravention of the substantive
law of India, contravention of the 1996 Act, and
contravention of the terms of the contract.”
(emphasis added)
In the decision of this Court in the case of Konkan Railway
Corporation Limited v. Chenab Bridge Project Undertaking 3, in
paragraph 18, it was held thus:
“18. At the outset, we may state that the jurisdiction
of the court under Section 37 of the Act, as clarified
by this Court in MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC
Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 163 : (2019) 2 SCC
(Civ) 293], is akin to the jurisdiction of the court under
Section 34 of the Act. [Id, SCC p. 167, para 14:“14. As
far as interference with an order made under Section 34,
as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed
that such interference under Section 37 cannot travel
beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34. In
other words, the court cannot undertake an independent
assessment of the merits of the award, and must only
ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under
3 [2023] 11 SCR 215 : (2023) 9 SCC 85
156 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
Section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision.”]
Scope of interference by a court in an appeal under
Section 37 of the Act, in examining an order, setting
aside or refusing to set aside an award, is restricted
and subject to the same grounds as the challenge
under Section 34 of the Act.”
(emphasis added)
16. The jurisdiction of the Appellate Court dealing with an appeal under
Section 37 against the judgment in a petition under Section 34 is
more constrained than the jurisdiction of the Court dealing with a
petition under Section 34. It is the duty of the Appellate Court to
consider whether Section 34 Court has remained confined to the
grounds of challenge that are available in a petition under Section 34.
The ultimate function of the Appellate Court under Section 37 is to
decide whether the jurisdiction under Section 34 has been exercised
rightly or wrongly. While doing so, the Appellate Court can exercise
the same power and jurisdiction that Section 34 Court possesses
with the same constraints.
17. In the facts of the case in hand, while deciding the petition under
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the learned Single Judge has made a
very elaborate consideration of the submissions made across the Bar,
the findings recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal and the issue of illegality
or perversity of the award. Detailed reasons while dealing with the
alleged patent illegalities associated with the directions issued under
the arbitral award have been recorded. Considering the nature of the
findings recorded by the learned Single Judge, the job of the Appellate
Court was to scrutinise the said findings and to decide, one way or
the other, on merits. In this case, the finding of the Appellate Bench
that the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge does not
address several issues raised by the parties cannot be sustained at all.
18. The provisions of the CPC have not been made applicable to the
proceedings before the learned Arbitrator and the Court under
Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act. The legislature’s intention
is reflected in Section 19(1) of the Arbitration Act, which provides that
an Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the provision of the CPC. That
is why the provisions of the CPC have not been made applicable to
the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37(1)(c). We are not even
suggesting that because the provisions of the CPC are not applicable,
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 157
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
the Appellate Court dealing with an appeal under Section 37(1)(c)
is powerless to pass an order of remand. The remedy of an appeal
will not be effective unless there is a power of remand vesting in
the appellate authority. In the Arbitration Act, there is no statutory
embargo on the power of the Appellate Court under Section 37(1)(c)
to pass an order of remand. However, looking at the scheme of the
Arbitration Act, the Appellate Court can exercise the power of remand
only when exceptional circumstances make an order of remand
unavoidable. There may be exceptional cases where remand in an
appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act may be warranted.
Some of the exceptional cases can be stated by way of illustration:
a. Summary disposal of a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act is made without consideration of merits;
b. Without service of notice to the respondent in a petition under
Section 34, interference is made with the award; and
c. Decision in proceedings under Section 34 is rendered when
one or more contesting parties are dead, and their legal
representatives have not been brought on record.
19. Some of the objectives mentioned in the Statement of Objects and
Reasons of the Arbitration Act are very relevant which are as follows:
“4. The main objectives of the Bill are as under:-
(i) to comprehensively cover international commercial
arbitration and conciliation as also domestic arbitration
and conciliation;
(ii) to make provision for an arbitral procedure which
is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs
of the specific arbitration;
(iii) to provide that the arbitral tribunal gives reasons for
its arbitral award;
(iv) to ensure that the arbitral tribunal remains within the
limits of its jurisdiction;
(v) to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the
arbitral process;
…………………………………”
(emphasis added)
158 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
While coming out with the 2015 Amendment Bill, the legislature has
noted in the objects and reasons that a lot of delay is involved in
concluding the arbitral proceedings. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of the
objects and reasons of the Bill, the Legislature has stated thus:
“6. It is proposed to introduce the Arbitration and Conciliation
(Amendment) Bill, 2015, to replace the Arbitration and
Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015, which inter
alia, provides for the following, namely—
(i) to amend the definition of “Court” to provide that in
the case of international commercial arbitrations, the
Court should be the High Court;
(ii) to ensure that an Indian Court can exercise jurisdiction
to grant interim measures, etc., even where the seat
of the arbitration is outside India;
(iii) an application for appointment of an arbitrator shall
be disposed of by the High Court or Supreme Court,
as the case may be, as expeditiously as possible
and an endeavour should be made to dispose of the
matter within a period of sixty days;
(iv) to provide that while considering any application
for appointment of arbitrator, the High Court or the
Supreme Court shall examine the existence of a
prima facie arbitration agreement and not other
issues;
(v) to provide that the arbitral tribunal shall make
its award within a period of twelve months from
the date it enters upon the reference and that the
parties may, however, extend such period up to
six months, beyond which period any extension
can only be granted by the Court, on sufficient
cause;
(vi) to provide that a model fee Schedule on the basis of
which High Courts may frame rules for the purpose
of determination of fees of arbitral tribunal, where
a High Court appoints arbitrator in terms of Section
11 of the Act;
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 159
Bombay Slum Redevelopment Corporation Private Limited v.
Samir Narain Bhojwani
(vii) to provide that the parties to dispute may at any
stage agree in writing that their dispute be resolved
through fast track procedure and the award in such
cases shall be made within a period of six months;
(viii) to provide for neutrality of arbitrators, when a person is
approached in connection with possible appointment
as an arbitrator;
(ix) to provide that application to challenge the award
is to be disposed of by the Court within one year.
7. The amendments proposed in the Bill will ensure that
arbitration process becomes more user friendly, cost
effective and lead to expeditious disposal of cases.”
(emphasis added)
The object of the Arbitration Act is to provide an arbitral procedure
that is fair, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of specific
arbitration. The object is to ensure that the arbitral proceedings
and proceedings filed for challenging the award are concluded
expeditiously. The proceedings have to be cost-effective. The
supervisory role of the Courts is very restricted. Moreover, we cannot
ignore that arbitration is one of the modes of Alternative Disputes
Redressal Mechanism provided in Section 89 of the CPC. If the
Courts dealing with appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act
start routinely passing the orders of remand, the arbitral procedure
will cease to be efficient. It will cease to be cost-effective. Such
orders will delay the conclusion of the proceedings, thereby defeating
the very object of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, an order of remand
by Section 37 Court can be made only in exceptional cases where
remand is unavoidable. As observed earlier, the scope of interference
in a petition under Section 34 is very narrow. The jurisdiction under
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act is narrower. Looking to the objects
of the Arbitration Act and the limited scope available to the Courts
to interfere with the award of the Arbitral Tribunal, this Court, while
dealing with the decisions under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration
Act, in its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India,
has to be circumspect. By their own volition, the parties choose to
go before the Arbitral Tribunal instead of availing remedy before the
traditional civil courts. Therefore, the Courts must be very conservative
160 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
when dealing with arbitral awards and confine themselves to the
grounds strictly available under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
20. In the facts of the case, the remand was completely unwarranted.
The reason is that the learned Single Judge has elaborately dealt
with the merits of the challenge in the Section 34 petition. This Court
should benefit from reasoned judgment rendered by the Court under
Section 37. In this case, we do not have the benefit of a decision
of the Appellate Court dealing with all the issues dealt with by the
learned Single Judge while deciding the petition under Section 34 of
the Arbitration Act. Therefore, it will not be appropriate for this Court
to look at the arbitral award and the findings recorded by the Section
34 Court and exercise the jurisdiction of the Section 37 Court. If
we do something which Section 37 Court was required to do, it will
be unjust to the parties as the unsuccessful party before us will be
deprived of one forum of challenge. Therefore, we have no option
but to set aside the impugned judgment of the Division Bench and
request the Division Bench to decide the appeals on merits after
considering the arbitral award and the decision of Section 34 Court.
21. Before we part with the judgment, we must record some serious
concerns based on our judicial experience. Case after case, we
find that the arbitral proceedings have become synonymous with
very bulky pleadings and evidence and very long, time-consuming
submissions, leading to very lengthy awards. Moreover, there is a
tendency to rely upon a large number of precedents, relevant or
irrelevant. The result of all this is that we have very long hearings
before the Courts in Sections 34 and 37 proceedings.
22. By way of illustration, we are referring to the factual aspects of the
present case. The award runs into 139 pages. The petition under
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act runs into 93 pages and incorporates
151 grounds. The judgment of the learned Single Judge dealing
with the petition under Section 34 consists of 101 pages. One of the
contributing factors is that more than 35 decisions were relied upon
by the parties before the learned Single Judge. On the same point,
multiple judgments have been cited, taking similar views. As per the
practice in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, a memorandum
of appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act does not contain
the facts but only the grounds of challenge. In the memorandum
of appeal preferred by the respondent consisting of 46 pages, 164
[2024] 7 S.C.R. 161

Samir Narain Bhojwani
grounds have been incorporated. Considering the narrow scope of
interference under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act, we
cannot comprehend how there could be 151 grounds in a petition
under Section 34 and 164 grounds in an appeal under Section 37.
It is not surprising that this appeal has a synopsis running into 45
pages, and it contains as many as 54 grounds of challenge.
23. In many cases, the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 are being
treated as if the same are appeals under Section 96 of the CPC.
When members of the bar take up so many grounds in petitions under
Section 34, which are not covered by Section 34, there is a tendency
to urge all those grounds which are not available in law and waste
the Court’s time. The time of our Courts is precious, considering the
huge pendency. This is happening in a large number of cases. All this
makes the arbitral procedure inefficient and unfair. It is high time that
the members of the Bar show restraint by incorporating only legally
permissible grounds in petitions under Section 34 and the appeals
under Section 37. Everyone associated with the arbitral proceedings
must remember that brevity will make the arbitral proceedings and
the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 more effective. All that
we say is that all the stakeholders need to introspect. Otherwise,
the very object of adopting the UNCITRAL model will be frustrated.
We are not called upon to consider whether the arbitral proceedings
are cost-effective. In an appropriate case, the issue will have to be
considered. Arbitration must become a tool for expeditious, effective,
and cost-effective dispute resolution.
24. As we are directing the rehearing of the appeal under Section 37
of the Arbitration Act, it is necessary to extend the interim relief that
was operative during the pendency of these appeals.
25. Accordingly, we pass the following order:
a. The impugned judgment dated 7th July 2023 in Commercial
Appeal no.31 of 2023 is, hereby, set aside, and Commercial
Appeal no.30 of 2023 is restored to the file of the High Court
of Judicature at Bombay;
b. The restored appeal shall be placed before the roster Bench on
29th July 2024 at 10:30 a.m. The parties to the appeal before
this Court shall be under an obligation to appear before the
concerned Bench on that day, and no fresh notice shall be

served to the parties. The High Court will permit the appellants
to file an amended memorandum of appeal containing only
the relevant and permissible grounds. The concerned Division
Bench shall fix a schedule for hearing of the appeal;
c. The Registry of this Court shall forward a copy of this judgment
to the Prothonotary and Senior Master of the High Court of
Bombay, who shall ensure that the appeal is listed before the
roster Bench as directed above;
d. The interim relief, granted by this Court on 11th August 2023,
shall continue to operate till the disposal of the remanded appeal;
e. We make it clear that we have made no adjudication on the
merits of the arbitral award and the judgment of the learned
Single Judge and all the issues arising in the remanded appeal
are left open to be decided by the High Court; and
f. The appeals are, accordingly, partly allowed with no orders as
to costs.
Result of the case: Appeals partly allowed.

predominantly initiated by entities that wield immense economic

trial commences, often acts as a ‘death sentence’ to the material

the potential of using prolonged litigation to prevent free speech and
public participation must also be kept in mind by courts. [Para 10]

Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI
1. Leave granted.
2. On 01 March 2024, an ex-parte ad interim order was passed by the
ADJ 05 of the South Saket Courts, New Delhi1 directing the appellants
(a media platform, one of its editors, and the concerned journalists) to
take down an article dated 21 February 2024 published on their online
platform within a week. The appellants were also restrained from posting,
circulating or publishing the article in respect of the respondent-plaintiff
on any online or offline platform till the next date of hearing.
3. The order of the trial Judge indicates that the discussion, after
recording the submission of the respondent, commences at paragraph
7. The only reasoning which is found in the order of the trial Judge
is in paragraphs 8-9, which read as follows:
“8. I have noticed that in Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi
(Supra), Chandra Kochar (Supra), Swami Ramdev
(Supra), ex-parte ad interim injunction was passed,
considering that the contents of the material in question
was per se defamatory.
9. In my view, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie
case for passing ad interim ex-parte orders of injunction,
balance of convenience is also in favour of plaintiff and
1 “trial Judge”
998 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
against the defendant and irreparable loss and injury
may be caused to the plaintiff, if the injunction as prayed
for is not granted. In view thereof, defendant no.1 and
defendant no.2 are directed to take down the article dated
21.02.2024 (page 84 to 86 of the plaintiff’s document)
from online platform within one week of receipt of this
order. The defendants are further restrained from posting,
circulating or publishing the aforesaid article in respect of
the plaintiff on any online or offline platform till the next
date of hearing.”
4. The order of the trial Judge has been upheld by a Single Judge of
the High Court of Delhi by order dated 14 March 2024.2 The Single
Judge of the High Court seems to have had doubts about the
maintainability of the appeal, but that point need not be laboured any
further having regard to the provisions of Order XLIII of the Code of
Civil Procedure 1908.
5. The three-fold test of establishing (i) a prima facie case, (ii) balance
of convenience and (iii) irreparable loss or harm, for the grant of
interim relief, is well-established in the jurisprudence of this Court.
This test is equally applicable to the grant of interim injunctions in
defamation suits. However, this three-fold test must not be applied
mechanically,3 to the detriment of the other party and in the case of
injunctions against journalistic pieces, often to the detriment of the
public. While granting interim relief, the court must provide detailed
reasons and analyze how the three-fold test is satisfied. A cursory
reproduction of the submissions and precedents before the court is
not sufficient. The court must explain how the test is satisfied and
how the precedents cited apply to the facts of the case.
6. In addition to this oft-repeated test, there are also additional factors,
which must weigh with courts while granting an ex-parte ad interim
injunction. Some of these factors were elucidated by a three-judge
bench of this Court in Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick
Das,4 in the following terms:
2 “Impugned Order”
3 Delhi Development Authority v. Skipper Construction Co. (P) Ltd., [1996] Suppl. 2 SCR 295 : (1996) 4
SCC 622, para 38.

[2024] 3 S.C.R. 999
Bloomberg Television Production Services India Private Limited & Ors.
v. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
“36. As a principle, ex parte injunction could be granted
only under exceptional circumstances. The factors which
should weigh with the court in the grant of ex parte
injunction are—
(a) whether irreparable or serious mischief will ensue
to the plaintiff;
(b) whether the refusal of ex parte injunction would
involve greater injustice than the grant of it would
involve;
(c) the court will also consider the time at which the
plaintiff first had notice of the act complained so that
the making of improper order against a party in his
absence is prevented;
(d) the court will consider whether the plaintiff had
acquiesced for sometime and in such circumstances
it will not grant ex parte injunction;
(e) the court would expect a party applying for ex parte
injunction to show utmost good faith in making the
application.
(f) even if granted, the ex parte injunction would be for
a limited period of time.
(g) General principles like prima facie case, balance
of convenience and irreparable loss would also be
considered by the court.”
7. Significantly, in suits concerning defamation by media platforms and/or
journalists, an additional consideration of balancing the fundamental
right to free speech with the right to reputation and privacy must be
borne in mind.5 The constitutional mandate of protecting journalistic
expression cannot be understated, and courts must tread cautiously
while granting pre-trial interim injunctions. The standard to be followed
may be borrowed from the decision in Bonnard v. Perryman.6 This
standard, christened the ‘Bonnard standard’, laid down by the Court
5 R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu, [1994] Suppl. 4 SCR 353 : (1994) 6 SCC 632.

1000 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
of Appeal (England and Wales), has acquired the status of a common
law principle for the grant of interim injunctions in defamation suits.7
The Court of Appeal in Bonnard (supra) held as follows:
“…But it is obvious that the subject-matter of an action for
defamation is so special as to require exceptional caution
in exercising the jurisdiction to interfere by injunction before
the trial of an action to prevent an anticipated wrong.
The right of free speech is one which it is for the public
interest that individuals should possess, and, indeed,
that they should exercise without impediment, so long as
no wrongful act is done; and, unless an alleged libel is
untrue, there is no wrong committed; but, on the contrary,
often a very wholesome act is performed in the publication
and repetition of an alleged libel. Until it is clear that an
alleged libel is untrue, it is not clear that any right at all
has been infringed; and the importance of leaving free
speech unfettered is a strong reason in cases of libel for
dealing most cautiously and warily with the granting of
interim injunctions.”
(emphasis supplied)
8. In Fraser v. Evans, 8 the Court of Appeal followed the Bonnard
principle and held as follows:
“… in so far as the article will be defamatory of Mr. Fraser,
it is clear he cannot get an injunction. The Court will not
restrain the publication of an article, even though it is
defamatory, when the defendant says he intends to justify it
or to make fair comment on a matter of public interest. That
has been established for many years ever since (Bonnard
v. Ferryman 1891 2 Ch. 269). ‘The reason sometimes given
is that the defences of justification and fair comment are
for the jury, which is the constitutional tribunal, and not
for a Judge. But a better reason is the importance in the
public interest that the truth should out. …”

v. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited
9. In essence, the grant of a pre-trial injunction against the publication
of an article may have severe ramifications on the right to freedom
of speech of the author and the public’s right to know. An injunction,
particularly ex-parte, should not be granted without establishing that
the content sought to be restricted is ‘malicious’ or ‘palpably false’.
Granting interim injunctions, before the trial commences, in a cavalier
manner results in the stifling of public debate. In other words, courts
should not grant ex-parte injunctions except in exceptional cases
where the defence advanced by the respondent would undoubtedly
fail at trial. In all other cases, injunctions against the publication of
material should be granted only after a full-fledged trial is conducted
or in exceptional cases, after the respondent is given a chance to
make their submissions.
10. Increasingly, across various jurisdictions, the concept of ‘SLAPP
Suits’ has been recognized either by statute or by courts. The term
‘SLAPP’ stands for ‘Strategic Litigation against Public Participation’
and is an umbrella term used to refer to litigation predominantly
initiated by entities that wield immense economic power against
members of the media or civil society, to prevent the public from
knowing about or participating in important affairs in the public
interest.9 We must be cognizant of the realities of prolonged trials.
The grant of an interim injunction, before the trial commences, often
acts as a ‘death sentence’ to the material sought to be published, well
before the allegations have been proven. While granting ad-interim
injunctions in defamation suits, the potential of using prolonged
litigation to prevent free speech and public participation must also
be kept in mind by courts.
11. The order of the trial Judge does not discuss, even cursorily, the
prima facie strength of the plaintiff’s case, nor does it deal with the
balance of convenience or the irreparable hardship that is caused.
The trial Judge needed to have analysed why such an ex parte
injunction was essential, after setting out the factual basis and the
contentions of the respondent made before the trial Judge. The trial
Judge merely states, in paras 7-8, that the court has “gone through
the record available as on date” and noticed certain precedents
9 Donson, F.J.L. 2000. Legal Intimidation: A SLAPP in the Face of Democracy. London, New York: Free
Association Books.
1002 [2024] 3 S.C.R.
Digital Supreme Court Reports
where an ad-interim injunction was granted. Without even cursorily
dwelling on the merits of the plaint, the ad-interim injunction granted
by the trial Judge amounts to unreasoned censorship which cannot
be countenanced.
12. Undoubtedly, the grant of an interim injunction is an exercise of
discretionary power and the appellate court (in this case, the High
Court) will usually not interfere with the grant of interim relief. However,
in a line of precedent, this Court has held that appellate courts must
interfere with the grant of interim relief if the discretion has been
exercised “arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely, or where the court has
ignored settled principles of law regulating the grant or refusal of
interlocutory injunctions.”10 The grant of an ex parte interim injunction
by way of an unreasoned order, definitely falls within the above
formulation, necessitating interference by the High Court. This being
a case of an injunction granted in defamation proceedings against
a media platform, the impact of the injunction on the constitutionally
protected right of free speech further warranted intervention.
13. In view of the above, the High Court ought to have, in our view,
also at least prima facie assessed whether the test for the grant of
an injunction was duly established after an evaluation of facts. The
same error which has been committed by the trial Judge has been
perpetuated by the Single Judge of the High Court. Merely recording
that a prima facie case exists, that the balance of convenience is
in favour of the grant of injunction and that an irreparable injury
would be caused, would not amount to an application of mind to
the facts of the case. The three-fold test cannot merely be recorded
as a mantra without looking into the facts on the basis of which an
injunction has been sought. In the absence of such a consideration
either by the trial Judge or by the High Court, we have no option but
to set aside both the orders of the trial Judge dated 1 March 2024
and of the Single Judge of the High Court dated 14 March 2024.
We do so accordingly.
14. Since the proceedings are now listed before the trial Judge on 26
March 2024, we direct that it would be open to the respondents to
